TI  - Bio-efficacy and operational feasibility of alphacypermethrin (Fendona)
      impregnated mosquito nets to control rural malaria in northern India.
PG  - 33-42
AB  - Bio-efficacy and operational feasibility of alphacypermethrin treated nets was
      evaluated in certain villages of District Ghaziabad (U.P.). Results revealed that
      poly-filament nylon nets treated with alphacypermethrin suspension concentrate
      (g/l) formulation @ 25 mg/m2 has shown repellent action (26.5 +/- 8.1), excito
      repellent action (93.7 +/- 8.1) and killing action (100%) against An.
      culicifacies landed on treated nets. Significant reduction in indoor resting
      density of An. culicifacies in human dwellings was also observed in treated nets 
      village (p < 0.05). Instant killing action of treated nets did provide complete
      protection to inhabitants sleeping inside the net from An. culicifacies bites.
      The persistent use of nets by the inhabitants has also resulted significant
      reduction in malaria cases (p < 0.05). It was interesting to note that not even a
      single case of falciparum malaria was observed after distribution of treated nets
      in spite of the fact that at no point of time cent per cent compliance of net
      usage was observed during the study period. Bio-assay tests revealed that treated
      nets can produce up to 70% mortality in An. culicifacies for about 22 weeks and
      as such only one treatment with insecticide is required in a year in seasonal
      transmission area to protect from malaria. The study also revealed that treated
      nets can be stored at room temperature for about 10 months without loosing their 
      efficacy suggesting thereby that malaria outbreaks can be tackled by the nets if 
      adequate treated nets are stored in core problem districts. It was also revealed 
      that An. culicifacies is a late night biter and as such treated nets can be used 
      successfully against this species.

TI  - Biolarvicides in vector control: challenges and prospects.
PG  - 20-32
AB  - Biolarvicides, based on mosquitocidal toxins of certain strains of Bacillus
      sphaericus and Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis H-14 (Bti) are highly
      effective against mosquito larvae at very low doses and safe to other non-target 
      organisms. During past two decades various biolarvicide formulations produced in 
      India and abroad have been tested at Malaria Research Centre and some
      formulations have undergone large-scale operational trials. Biolarvicide
      formulations of B. sphaericus are useful in the control of Culex and certain
      Anopheles spp, such as An. stephensi and An. subpictus, but not much effective
      against An. culicifacies and almost ineffective against Aedes aegypti. Repeated
      application of B. sphaericus in the same habitat, however, results in the
      development of resistance in larvae of target mosquitoes. In view of its low
      specificity for An. culicifacies and the potential for resistance in An.
      stephensi, B. sphaericus has limited prospects for control of malaria vectors.
      However, with some resistance management, B. sphaericus can still be used against
      Culex mosquitoes. On the other hand Bti formulations, which have broader spectrum
      of activity against Aedes, Culex and Anopheles spp, have not shown significant
      development of resistance in mosquitoes but their activity in field, particularly
      against surface feeding anopheline larvae is affected by various bioenvironmental
      factors, thus requiring weekly application in most habitats. To overcome this
      problem development of slow release formulations and genetically engineered
      biolarvicides by transplanting mosquitocidal toxin genes of Bti and B. sphaericus
      in some other environmentally compatible organisms have been investigated by
      different scientists.

TI  - Malaria genome project and its impact on the disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Malaria remains uncontrolled to-date due to lack of effective parasite and vector
      control strategies. With the completion of the host, parasite and vector genome
      projects more suitable and effective disease control measures can be achieved.
      Here we have reviewed the Plasmodium falciparum genome project and its impact on 
      malaria research in future. The parasite genome project has revealed certain
      metabolic pathways which can be targeted to develop antimalarial drugs. It has
      also identified large number of potential antigens for the future potential
      vaccines. Now the researchers in the malaria field can plan to take up the
      studies, which can yield more fruitful results within the limited financial
      resources using bioinformatics, proteomics, structural, functional and
      comparative genomics, etc.

TI  - Status of malaria in the Kingdom of Bahrain: a 10-year review.
PG  - 97-101
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria was eradicated in Bahrain about 20 years ago. However,
      because of a large immigrant population, cases of imported malaria continued to
      be seen. This paper presents an evaluation of the data from 1992 to 2001 to
      assess the levels of indigenous and imported malaria cases and the potential for 
      reemergence of malaria transmission in the country. METHODS: Epidemiologic and
      parasitologic data on confirmed malaria cases during the review period were
      analyzed. Data on vector breeding activity were also analyzed to determine the
      potential for reemergence of local transmission. RESULTS: From 1992 to 2001,
      1,572 cases of malaria were reported. All were imported malaria cases. There was 
      a consistent decline in the number of cases, from 282 (the peak level) in 1992 to
      54 in 2001. Eighty-four percent (1,318/1,572) of infections were contracted as a 
      result of travel to or previous domicile in five countries, namely India,
      Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Sudan. Plasmodium vivax was the etiologic
      agent in 85.6% (1,346/1,572) of cases, with Plasmodium falciparum accounting for 
      14% (220/1,572). During this period, the percentage of examined breeding sites
      where Anopheles mosquito larvae were identified remained fairly constant, ranging
      between 0.05% and 0.1%. CONCLUSIONS: From 1992 to 2001, there was a consistent
      decline in the number of imported malaria cases in Bahrain. There were no cases
      of locally acquired malaria during this period. The low level of vector breeding 
      spots with Anopheles mosquito larvae suggests that the potential for reemergence 
      of local transmission remains low.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of methanolic extract of Atlantia monophylla (Family:
      Rutaceae) against immature stages of mosquitoes and non-target organisms.
PG  - 115-8
AB  - Methanolic extracts of the leaves of Atlantia monophylla (Rutaceae) were
      evaluated for mosquitocidal activity against immature stages of three mosquito
      species, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti in the
      laboratory. Larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus and pupae of An. stephensi were found 
      more susceptible, with LC50 values of 0.14 mg/l and 0.05 mg/l, respectively.
      Insect growth regulating activity of this extract was more pronounced against Ae.
      aegypti, with EI50 value 0.002 mg/l. The extract was found safe to aquatic
      mosquito predators Gambusia affinis, Poecilia reticulata, and Diplonychus
      indicus, with the respective LC50 values of 23.4, 21.3, and 5.7 mg/l. The results
      indicate that the mosquitocidal effects of the extract of this plant were
      comparable to neem extract and certain synthetic chemical larvicides like
      fenthion, methoprene, etc.

TI  - Changing scenario of malaria in central India, the replacement of Plasmodium
      vivax by Plasmodium falciparum (1986-2000).
PG  - 364-71
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since 1986, we have been studying the changing epidemiology of
      malaria in a forest belt of Mandla, which has the highest number of malaria cases
      in central India (Madhya Pradesh) to define the epidemiological characteristics
      of the infection with each Plasmodium species in different seasons of the year.
      Our long-term objective was to determine the dynamics of Plasmodium vivax vs.P.
      falciparum infections. METHODS: Five villages underwent fortnightly surveillance 
      of fever cases. Drugs were distributed within 24 h after results of blood smears 
      became available as per Indian National Anti-Malaria Programme. Indoor resting
      mosquitoes were also collected fortnightly. RESULTS: The only two Plasmodium
      species encountered were P. vivax and P. falciparum in both children and adults. 
      Relatively more malaria infections were recorded in children (< or =14 years)
      than adults (>14 years) (chi2=89.94, P<0.00001). However, there were significant 
      falling trends in P. vivax from 1986 to 2000 in both age groups (< or =14 years
      from 63 to 13, P<0.0001 and >14 years from 84 to 7, P<0.0001). The indoor resting
      density of Anopheles culicifacies, an efficient vector resistant to both
      dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (4%) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
      (0.4%), was very high throughout this period in all villages (52.35 +/- 31.8,
      range 5-200 per man hour). Anopheles fluviatilis was present in small numbers
      0.78 +/- 1.24 (range 0-7 per man hour). CONCLUSION: Major contributors of the
      changing epidemiology of malaria in this area are changing drug sensitivity along
      with insecticide sensitivity.

TI  - Role of modified CDC miniature light-traps as an alternative method for sampling 
      adult anophelines (Diptera: Culicidae) in the National Mosquito Surveillance
      Programme in India.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - The efficiency of modified CDC miniature light-traps for sampling adult
      mosquitoes was evaluated in comparison with indoor resting, outdoor resting,
      indoor man-landing and outdoor man-landing collections in the hilly district of
      Koraput, Orissa, India. Overall, light-traps captured 78% of adult mosquitoes
      collected by all methods. Of the 16 anopheline species recorded in the study
      area, light-traps effectively sampled 13, contributing about 72% of the total
      anophelines collected by all methods. Light-traps also caught a large number of
      female Culex vishnui Theobald (96%). As fully-fed mosquitoes were predominant
      (82%) and caught alive, light-traps can be used to catch large numbers of vector 
      mosquitoes for studies on vector prevalence, distribution, vector incrimination
      and also for laboratory bioassays. Light-trap and indoor resting collections
      revealed similar seasonal trends in numbers of Anopheles culicifacies Giles, A.
      fluviatilis James, A. jeyporiensis James, A. vagus Doenitz, and A. splendidus
      Koidzumi. Age-structure of the samples did not vary significantly between the two
      methods. Light-traps could be used as an alternative to daytime indoor resting
      collections to monitor the seasonal fluctuations in the abundance and parity
      rates of these species. The light-trap collections correlated with indoor and
      outdoor man-landing collections of A. jeyporiensis and the outdoor man-landing
      collections of A. maculatusTheobald in measuring seasonal trends. Light-trap
      collections can thus be used as a substitute for man-landing collections of A.
      jeyporiensis and A. maculatus.

TI  - Differentiation of members of the Anopheles fluviatilis species complex by an
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction based on 28S ribosomal DNA sequences.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis, one of the major vectors of malaria in India, is a complex
      of at least three cryptic species provisionally designated as species S, T, and
      U. Identification of the cryptic species of An. fluviatilis complex is of
      paramount importance in disease control program due to contrasting differences in
      their vectorial efficiency, preference for feeding on humans, and resting
      behavior. Species S, T, and U are morphologically indistinguishable at any stage 
      of their life cycle and can be identified only by the examination of
      species-specific fixed inversions in the polytene chromosomes. We report an
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for the differentiation of
      members of An. fluviatilis complex, which is based on differences in nucleotide
      sequences in D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA. The assay was evaluated against
      chromosomally examined individuals from different localities with different
      sympatric associations and was found to differentiate unambiguously all the
      members of the complex.

TI  - Malaria outbreak in Bhojpur PHC of district Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.
PG  - 118-23
AB  - Based on the reports of 18 fever related deaths in Bhojpur Primary Health Centre 
      (PHC) of Moradabad District (UP), a study was undertaken during September and
      October, 2000 to explore the possibility of outbreak of malaria in the area and
      the reasons of the outbreak. The slide positivity rate (SPR) and slide falciparum
      rate (SFR) in active fever surveys were found to be 84.7% and 82.2% respectively.
      Among children the average enlarged spleen and spleen rate were 1.9 and 27.4 per 
      cent respectively. The mortality rate of Anopheles culicifacies in DDT, Malathion
      and Deltamethrin was 42.5, 86.7 and cent per cent respectively. The results of
      the study revealed that the outbreak was of malaria with predominance of
      Plasmodium falciparum causing several deaths in the affected villages. The
      investigation revealed that there was disruption of surveillance and supervision 
      of malaria activities.

TI  - Spiracular indices in Anopheles stephensi: a taxonomic tool to identify
      ecological variants.
PG  - 747-9
AB  - Thoracic spiracle length and its index was examined for their ability to
      discriminate two ecological variants, type form and mysorensis, of Anopheles
      stephensi in the adult stage. The type form is exclusively domestic in all
      seasons, whereas the mysorensis variant occupies the outdoor niche during monsoon
      and postmonsoon seasons, with spillover into domestic sites during summer
      ecological stress periods. A statistically significant co-relation was
      established between the ridge count of the egg and two adult measurements, the
      thoracic spiracle length, and the spiracular index. In An. stephensi type form,
      average spiracle length was 0.11-0.12 mm and average spiracular index was
      8.09-9.23, whereas in mysorensis, the corresponding figures were 0.09-0.10 mm and
      6.82-7.60. These parameters showed consistent variations in population of
      mosquitoes that emerged during monsoon and summer season. The thoracic lengths in
      both variants remained constant, and only spiracular lengths showed fluctuations 
      in three seasonal populations. These measures provide discrimination of adult
      variants--identifications that are essential in malaria control programs.

TI  - A review of the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum-dominated malaria in irrigated
      areas of the Thar Desert, India.
PG  - 227-39
AB  - Recently, there has been a resurgence of malaria in several parts of India, and
      the Thar Desert in north-western India, is currently suffering from the impact of
      repeated annual epidemics. Nearly all malaria epidemics in the Thar Desert have
      come about with the progression of canal-irrigation work, particularly the
      massive Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojana (IGNP). Therefore, the Thar Desert
      provides an excellent model for understanding the underlying factors responsible 
      for the exacerbation of malaria, pathways of evolution of the epidemics,
      succession in anopheline fauna, changes in the vector breeding and feeding
      preferences and, most importantly, the possible repercussions of mismanagement of
      irrigation systems. Before the initiation of canalised irrigation only Anopheles 
      stephensi, breeding exclusively in household and community-based underground
      water reservoirs, and transmitting malaria at a low level, was prevalent in the
      interior of the Thar Desert. Since the 1980s, extensive irrigation with water
      from three different canal systems has altered the desert physiography, vector
      preponderance, distribution and vectorial capacity, whilst triggering the
      emergence of Plasmodium falciparum-dominated malaria in the virgin levees of the 
      Thar Desert. The major objective of bringing the Himalayan waters to the xeric
      environment of the Thar was to transform it into verdure through growing
      irrigation-intensive crops like paddy, groundnut, cotton, mustard, wheat and
      sugarcane, besides providing drinking water to the desert dwellers. The change in
      crop pattern, retention of high surface moisture, and excessive canalisation rife
      with mismanagement of irrigation water have attracted several anophelines,
      including Anopheles culicifacies, which were earlier unknown in the desert. Thus,
      A. culicifacies has penetrated into the interior of the Thar Desert, along with
      irrigation and is now established in vast areas covered by the IGNP project. The 
      distribution of P. falciparum-dominated malaria in the Thar Desert is more or
      less synchronous with the spread of IGNP-related irrigated agriculture and of A. 
      culicifacies.

TI  - Engineering and malaria control: learning from the past 100 years.
PG  - 99-108
AB  - Traditionally, engineering and environment-based interventions have contributed
      to the prevention of malaria in Asia. However, with the introduction of DDT and
      other potent insecticides, chemical control became the dominating strategy. The
      renewed interest in environmental-management-based approaches for the control of 
      malaria vectors follows the rapid development of resistance by mosquitoes to the 
      widely used insecticides, the increasing cost of developing new chemicals,
      logistical constraints involved in the implementation of residual-spraying
      programs and the environmental concerns linked to the use of persistent organic
      pollutants. To guide future research and operational agendas focusing on
      environmental-control interventions, it is necessary to learn from the successes 
      and failures from the time before the introduction of insecticides. The objective
      of this paper is to describe the experiences gained in Asia with early vector
      control interventions focusing on cases from the former Indian Punjab, Malaysia
      and Sri Lanka. The paper deals primarily with the agricultural engineering and
      land and water management vector control interventions implemented in the period 
      1900-1950. The selected cases are discussed in the wider context of
      environment-based approaches for the control of malaria vectors, including
      current relevance. Clearly, some of the interventions piloted and implemented
      early in the last century still have relevance today but generally in a very
      site-specific manner and in combination with other preventive and curative
      activities. Some of the approaches followed earlier on to support implementation 
      would not be acceptable or feasible today, from a social or environmental point
      of view.

TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for malaria vector Anopheles minimus and four related species
      in the Myzomyia Series from Southeast Asia.
PG  - 423-8
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of the Anopheles (Cellia) Myzomyia Series are
      important malaria vectors in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. Among 10 named
      species of Myzomyia known from the Oriental Region, seven form the An. minimus
      group. Even for expert taxonomists, the adults of these species remain difficult 
      to identify morphologically. For technical staff of malaria control programmes,
      confusion may extend to misidentification of species that are not formally within
      the minimus group. For identification of specimens from Indochina (Cambodia,
      Laos, Vietnam), we describe a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay,
      based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences, that employs a
      cocktail of primers to identify An. minimus Theobald sibling species A and C
      (sensu; Green et al., 1990) and three other species in the An. minimus group (An.
      aconitus Donitz, An. pampanai Buttiker & Beales, An. varuna Iyengar), as well as 
      An. jeyporiensis James, also belonging to the Myzomyia Series. As the test is
      DNA-based, it can be applied to all life stages of these mosquitoes for
      ecological investigations and vector incrimination studies. This PCR assay is
      simpler, quicker, cheaper and more readily interpreted than previous assays.

TI  - Impact of alphacypermethrin treated bed nets on malaria in villages of Malkangiri
      district, Orissa, India.
PG  - 55-66
AB  - The impact of use of bed-nets treated with alphacypermethrin, at 20 mg (ai)/m2,
      in comparison to untreated nets or no nets on malaria vectors and malaria
      incidence was studied in tribal villages of Malkangiri district, Orissa state,
      India, which are highly endemic for falciparum malaria. Treated or untreated nets
      were supplied to the villagers in June 1999 and the nets were re-treated in
      September 1999, just before the rise in vector abundance and malaria incidence.
      The seasonal pattern of indoor resting Anopheles fluviatilis females was similar 
      in all the three groups of villages before the start of intervention and the
      indoor resting catches were not significantly different between treatment-groups 
      (two-way ANOVA, F = 1.53; d.f. = (2, 78); P = 0.2). During intervention, the
      indoor resting catches differed significantly among treatment groups (two-way
      ANOVA, F = 38.9; d.f.= (2, 66); P < 0.005). There was a 99% reduction in the
      indoor resting catches of An. fluviatilis in villages with treated nets and 61%
      reduction in villages with untreated nets compared with no-net villages.
      Comparison between villages with and without treated nets showed that there was
      97% reduction in indoor resting catches in villages with treated nets. Pair-wise 
      comparison showed that the reductions between villages with and without nets as
      well as between villages with treated and untreated nets were significant
      (Dunnett's C-test, P < 0.05). The indoor resting catches of Anopheles
      culicifacies did not differ significantly among the three groups of villages
      either before (F = 0.99; d.f. = (2, 121); P = 0.4) or during intervention (F =
      0.21; d.f. = (2, 66); P = 0.8). Bioassay with 3 min exposure to treated bed nets 
      showed 100% mortality of An. culicifacies for 2 months and with An. fluviatilis
      for 4.5 months after which tests were not carried out. In villages with treated
      nets, the Annual Parasite Incidence (API) significantly declined (P < 0.05) by
      about 65.7% and prevalence of infection among children (< 15 years) declined by
      57.1%, whereas in villages with untreated nets, there was only 34% reduction in
      API and 13% in the prevalence of infection. In villages with treated nets, there 
      was 48% reduction in API and 64% in prevalence of infection compared with
      villages with untreated nets. The impact of use of treated bed nets on other
      arthropod pests lasted for at least 1.5 months. After 1.5 months, observations on
      arthropod pests were not continued. The use rate of treated nets varied from 49.8
      to 93.7% in three seasons and about 68.3% of treated bed nets and 60% of
      untreated nets were in good condition 1 year after distribution. Out of 489 users
      of treated net, five people complained of a burning sensation on the face (skin
      irritation) for 5 days following the distribution of treated nets. There were no 
      other complaints of any discomfort in using the treated nets. The use of
      alphacypermethrin treated bed nets at 20 mg (ai)/m2 can be one of the options for
      reducing the vector abundance and incidence of malaria in this area.

TI  - A long-term study on vector abundance & seasonal prevalence in relation to the
      occurrence of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur district, Uttar Pradesh.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is an important cause
      of viral encephalitis in Gorakhpur district, UP. The area has been experiencing
      outbreaks of JE since 1978. No in-depth longitudinal studies have been carried
      out on the mosquito species, particularly JE vectors prevailing in the area.
      Entomological studies were carried out in the district in order to determine the 
      species composition, relative abundance and seasonal prevalence of mosquitoes in 
      relation to the incidence of JE. METHODS: Three JE affected villages were
      selected as study sites. Weekly visits were made to each village and mosquito
      collections were made in and around the pig enclosures and cattle sheds with the 
      help of mouth aspirators, aided by flash lights at dusk. RESULTS: The overall
      mosquito population showed a bimodal pattern with short and tall peaks during
      March and September respectively. Based on the elevated density and infection
      with JE virus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus has been considered responsible for
      causing epidemics in the area. Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. whitmorei, Cx. gelidus, Cx.
      epidesmus, Anopheles subpictus, An. peditaeniatus and Mansonia uniformis are
      suspected to have played some role in the epidemiology of JE in the region. JE
      cases were reported between August and November with the peak in October when the
      vectors population, particularly Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was on the decline.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus, the most likely vector of JE together with other known vector 
      species remained more active during the period of paddy cultivation. Integrated
      antilarval measures before the beginning of paddy irrigation may check the
      breeding of JE vectors in the paddy fields. It may prove beneficial in reducing
      the vector population during the JE transmission season.

TI  - Novel fermentation media for production of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.
      israelensis.
PG  - 1039-44
AB  - The production of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (deBarjac) (Bti) as a
      biopesticide is not cost-effective using existing fermentation technology. In
      this study, we explored the use of several less expensive alternative culture
      media (potato, common sugar, and Bengal gram) for the growth and production of
      Bti. Growth was obtained in all tested media and was comparable to that obtained 
      in conventional medium (Luria-Bertani). Toxicity assays showed that the toxin
      produced from the novel growth media were effective in killing larvae of Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti and toxicity was
      comparable to that produced from Luria-Bertani medium. These observations suggest
      that potato can be used as a cheap source of culture medium for the production of
      Bti toxin in mosquito control programs.

TI  - Malaria control in a forest camp in an oil exploration area of Upper Assam.
PG  - 135-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assam, in north-east India, is extremely rich in hydrocarbon deposits
      and the oil industry is the major contributor to its economy. A large number of
      oil fields and related installations in Assam are located in forest areas or on
      their fringes where malaria is a serious problem among field staff and security
      personnel, adversely affecting oil production. We carried out an operational
      research study for one year in a forest-based industrial security camp of
      Dibrugarh district and developed an effective malaria control strategy for such
      areas. METHODS: The specific strategy was formulated and implemented after taking
      into account the local epidemiology of malaria, vector's ecology and malaria risk
      behaviour of the camp inmates. The strategy was based on reducing the man-vector 
      contact, using deltamethrin-treated mosquito nets in conjunction with mosquito
      repellent cream and weekly chemoprophylaxis with 300 mg chloroquine. The impact
      of the strategy was monitored entomologically and epidemiologically for one year 
      after implementation. RESULTS: The mean landing rate of Anopheles dirus, the
      vector mosquito in the camp area, was 5.03 per person per night during the
      monitoring. In spite of such a high density of the vector, the man-vector contact
      was effectively checked by the intervention measures adopted. As a result, the
      incidence of malaria in the camp was reduced by > 90% as compared to previous
      years and the number of malaria cases came down from 6.7 per 1000 man-nights in
      1998-99 to 0.06 in 2000-01. Mortality due to malaria was completely eliminated.
      CONCLUSION: Control of malaria should be based on the local determinants of
      transmission. The use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in conjunction with a 
      mosquito repellent cream is a good intervention for controlling Anopheles
      dirus-transmitted malaria in the forests of north-east India. The control module 
      developed on the principle of reducing man-mosquito contact is easy to implement,
      cost-effective and replicable in similar forest-based locations.

TI  - Pyrethroid susceptibility & enzyme activity in two malaria vectors, Anopheles
      stephensi (Liston) &. A. culicifacies (Giles) from Mysore, India.
PG  - 30-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles stephensi and A. culicifacies are the two
      major vectors of malaria in Karnataka. These mosquito populations are
      continuously being exposed directly or indirectly to different insecticides
      including the most effective pyrethroids. Therefore, there is a threat of
      insecticide resistance development. We subjected these vectors to larval bioassay
      using two popular pyrethroids viz deltamethrin and permethrin. An attempt was
      also made to correlate the activities of certain detoxifying enzymes such as A-
      esterase, B-esterase, glutathione-S transferase (GST) and glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) with the tolerance levels of the two vectors. METHODS:
      Larval bioassay was carried out following the standard WHO procedure on
      field-collected larvae. The LC50 and LC90 values were calculated following Probit
      analysis. Biochemical estimations were done with a U V spectrophotometer and the 
      isozyme studies employing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
      RESULTS: The results of the larval bioassay revealed that A. stephensi has more
      tolerance to deltamethrin than A. culicifacies and vice versa for permethrin.
      Biochemical estimations revealed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of
      A-esterase and GST activity in A. stephensi whereas A. culicifacies showed
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of B-esterase and G6PD activity. The total
      larval protein assayed was found to be more (P < 0.05) in A. stephensi. The
      isozyme profiles also revealed difference in mobility, intensity and the number
      of bands. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: As these malaria vectors are exposed to
      different kinds of insecticides, they develop increased enzyme activities to
      overcome the insecticide pressure. This has enhanced the tolerance level against 
      the pyrethroids tested. Thus, A. stephensi was found to be tolerant to
      deltamethrin depicting a higher activity of A-esterase and GST enzymes, whereas
      the higher activity of B-esterase and G6PD has resulted in the development of
      tolerance to permethrin in A. culicifacies.

TI  - Efficacy of two organophosphorus insecticides, Reldan & Dursban against the
      larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The resistance in vectors to conventional insecticides
      warrants development of newer insecticides for mosquito control besides use of
      other counter-measures. The present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of 
      a new and toxicologically safe organophosphorus compound, Reldan
      (chlorpyrifos-methyl) and compare its efficacy with Dursban (chlorphyrifos-ethyl)
      against larvae of different mosquito vectors under laboratory conditions and
      against Culex quinquefasciatus in three larval habitats. METHODS: The
      susceptibility of larvae of mosquito vector species to Reldan and Dursban was
      determined by following the standard procedure and the LC50 in mg/l values were
      calculated by probit analysis. The insecticides were evaluated in the larval
      habitats of C. quinquefasciatus in and around Pondicherry. The percentage
      reduction in larval density was calculated using Mulla's formula and duration
      showing more than 80 per cent reduction was calculated by annotating the graph
      obtained by plotting percentage reduction in larval density against days of
      post-treatment. RESULTS: Dursban and Reldan were effective against Anopheles
      fluviatilis larvae at lower LC50 of 5.90 x 10(-7) and 1.07 x 10(-9) mg/l
      respectively compared to other species of mosquitoes. Dursban and Reldan were
      equally effective against Aedes aegypti, An. stephensi and An. culicifacies.
      Reldan was about nine times more effective than Dursban against C.
      quinquefasciatus with respective LC50 of 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.34 x 10(-3) mg/l.
      Field evaluation of these insecticides against C. quinquefasciatus showed that
      Reldan and Dursban at the application rate of 500 g (ai)/ha reduced immature
      density by more than 80 per cent for a mean duration of 4.0 and 4.5 days and 4.6 
      and 3.7 days in cesspits and cement tanks respectively. In U-drains, at 500 g
      (ai)/ha, Reldan was effective for a period of 3.6 days whereas, Dursban was not
      effective. It was effective for 4.0 days only at 1000 g(ai)/ha. There was no
      significant increase in the residual activity of both Dursban and Reldan with
      increase in application rates. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: In view of the lack
      of sustained control with the applications, it is inferred that these
      insecticides will be of limited use as larvicides against C. quinquefasciatus
      breeding in polluted habitats.

TI  - Experimental transmission of Chikungunya virus by Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes.
PG  - 45-7
AB  - The Ades aegypti mosquito has been considered the principal vector of Chikungunya
      (CHIK) virus. As CHIK epidemics usually occur in urban regions and Anopheles
      stephensi is another highly endophilic and anthropophilic mosquito, there is a
      very high probability of this mosquito to feed on CHIK virus-infected patients,
      to pick up and transmit the virus. Therefore the present study was conducted to
      test the CHIK virus transmission capability for the A. stephensi mosquito. The
      obtained results showed that this mosquito species is capable of transmitting
      CHIK virus. It is surmised that during any epidemic of febrile illness CHIK virus
      isolation attempts should also be made from this mosquito species.

TI  - Forest malaria in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, central India: a case study in a
      tribal community.
PG  - 602-7
AB  - Parasitologic and entomologic cross-sectional surveys were carried out during an 
      outbreak of malaria between December 1998 and August 2000 in forest villages near
      the Mohkhed Primary Health Center in the Chhindwara District of Madhya Pradesh in
      central India. In December 1998, surveys showed that more than 70% of the fever
      cases had malaria, with 87% of the malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The
      rate of enlarged spleens in children was 74.5%. In November 1999, 58% of the
      inhabitants were infected with malaria, with 80% of these cases caused by P.
      falciparum. Chloroquine resistance was seen in 23% of the cases. Anopheles
      culicifacies was the dominant mosquito species in all surveys (70-85%) and was
      resistant to DDT. The results indicate that the incidence of malaria in
      Chhindwara has increased gradually from 0.31 per 1,000 in 1990 to 6.75 per 1,000 
      in 2000. Improved access to treatment facilities, combination therapy, and vector
      control using an effective insecticide appear to be the most promising methods
      for controlling malaria in this region.

TI  - Synthetic propeptide inhibits mosquito midgut chitinase and blocks sporogonic
      development of malaria parasite.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - Incessant transmission of the parasite by mosquitoes makes most attempts to
      control malaria fail. Blocking of parasite transmission by mosquitoes therefore
      is a rational strategy to combat the disease. Upon ingestion of blood meal
      mosquitoes secrete chitinase into the midgut. This mosquito chitinase is a
      zymogen which is activated by the removal of a propeptide from the N-terminal.
      Since the midgut peritrophic matrix acts as a physical barrier, the activated
      chitinase is likely to contribute to the further development of the malaria
      parasite in the mosquito. Earlier it has been shown that inhibiting chitinase
      activity in the mosquito midgut blocked sporogonic development of the malaria
      parasite. Since synthetic propeptides of several zymogens have been found to be
      potent inhibitors of their respective enzymes, we tested propeptide of mosquito
      midgut chitinase as an inhibitor and found that the propeptide almost completely 
      inhibited the recombinant or purified native Anopheles gambiae chitinase. We also
      examined the effect of the inhibitory peptide on malaria parasite development.
      The result showed that the synthetic propeptide blocked the development of human 
      malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in the African malaria vector An. gambiae 
      and avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
      This study implies that the expression of inhibitory mosquito midgut chitinase
      propeptide in response to blood meal may alter the mosquito's vectorial capacity.
      This may lead to developing novel strategies for controlling the spread of
      malaria.

PG  - 185-9
AB  - Methanol extracts of Pelargonium citrosa leaf were tested for their biological,
      larvicidal, pupicidal, adulticidal, antiovipositional activity, repellency and
      biting deterrency against Anopheles stephensi. Larval mortality was dose
      dependent with the highest dose of 4% plant extract evoking 98% mortality. The
      extracts affected pupicidal and adulticidal activity and significantly decreased 
      fecundity and longevity of A. stephensi. The larval, pupal and adult development 
      were completely inhibited by the treatment. At 4% the extracts evoked strong
      repellent action. They also interfered with oviposition, egg hatchability, and
      exhibited a growth inhibiting effect against larvae and good repellency against
      adults of A. stephensi. The leaf extract treatment significantly enhanced biting 
      deterrency. As naturally occurring insecticides, these plant derived materials
      could be useful as an alternative for synthetic insecticides controlling field
      populations of mosquitoes.

TI  - Estimation of vectorial capacity of Anopheles dirus (Diptera: Culicidae) in a
      forest-fringed village of Assam (India).
PG  - 231-7
AB  - To estimate the vectorial capacity of Anopheles dirus, the main vector of forest 
      malaria in the northeastern region of India, in order to gain an understanding of
      entomological factors related to malaria transmission in forest-fringe areas of
      Assam, India, an isolated village in the tropical rain forest-fringed area in the
      district of Dibrugarh, Assam, under the influence of An. dirus alone was studied.
      Data on various entomological variables required for computation of the vectorial
      capacity were generated in each month from June 1999 to May 2000 in the field
      using standard techniques. Malaria prevalence was also studied during the same
      period in the study village and correlated with the estimated vectorial capacity 
      of An. dirus. Vectorial capacity of An. dirus was highest, 0.779 for Plasmodium
      vivax (Pv) and 0.649 for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), during the hot-monsoon
      season (June-September) and decreased to 0.08 (Pv) and 0.07(Pf) in the temperate 
      postmonsoon season (October-November) before attaining zero values in the
      cool-dry season (December-February). With increasing temperature in the temperate
      premonsoon season (March-May), vectorial capacity recorded was 0.119 and 0.82 for
      Pv and Pf, respectively. Significant positive correlation was seen between the
      estimated vectorial capacity of An. dirus and the number of new Pf (r = 0.86, p <
      0.001) and Pv (r = 0.69, p < 0.02) cases in the study village in different
      months. Thus, this study highlights the pattern of malaria transmission by An.
      dirus in a forest-fringe area of Assam that begins in March, peaks in
      July/August, subsides by November, and remains interrupted between December and
      February. Measures for controlling malaria in forest-fringe areas should be
      scheduled accordingly.

PG  - 609-13
AB  - Innate immune related polypeptides expression during three gonotrophic cycles in 
      the ovaries of major disease vector mosquito A. stephensi has been analyzed
      following infection by malaria parasite, P. yoelii yoelii. Seventeen polypeptides
      were induced in the ovaries of various stages due to parasitic infection. Most of
      proteins were induced systemically during early stages of infection suggesting
      the possibility of immune related signalling process. The reduction in the
      quantity of protein contents in infected mosquitoes has been ascribed to the
      repression of seven polypeptides and in turn correlated with the fecundity
      reduction. The mechanism of these responses and their significance for malaria
      transmission and fecundity reduction are discussed.

PG  - 583-8
AB  - Field collected An. stephensi larvae were colonized in the laboratory for 15
      generations and acclimatized. An isofemale line was raised from this colony and
      the larvae were subjected to continuous deltamethrin selection pressure. LC50 and
      LC90 values were calculated at every generation. The values indicated that at the
      end of seventh generation the larvae have developed 87 fold tolerance in terms of
      LC50 value compared with the first generation. The reason for this kind of
      resistance was analyzed on the basis of differential activity of A-esterase,
      B-esterase, glutathione s-transferase (GST) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
      (G6PD). A significant correlation (P < 0.05) was observed with B-esterase and
      G6PD activity with the rise in the LC50 and LC90 values. However no significant
      rise were observed in the other enzymes tested such as A-esterase and GST. The
      isozyme analysis of the A-esterase and B-esterase using polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis (PAGE) have shown differential profiles.

      north-eastern region of India, was studied in relation to physico-chemical
      characteristics of its breeding habitats in a rain forest area of Assam, India.
      Shady stream side pools, positive for the breeding of An. dirus, had
      significantly higher amounts of total hardness (P < 0.024) in comparison to
      negative pools of similar type. When compared with An. dirus negative breeding
      habitats, in hot-wet as well as in cool-dry seasons, An. dirus positive shady
      ground pools showed higher mean values of total alkalinity, hardness and chloride
      content, whereas lower pH, dissolved oxygen along with higher total alkalinity
      and hardness were possessed by An. dirus positive stream side pools. Specificity 
      of breeding habitats of An. dirus in relation to its ecology has been discussed.

TI  - House-scale evaluation of bifenthrin indoor residual spraying for malaria vector 
      control in India.
PG  - 58-63
AB  - In an area of India where the main rural malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies
      Giles, has developed triple resistance to DDT, HCH, and malathion sprayed indoors
      in antimalaria program, bifenthrin (10% wettable powder) was evaluated in a
      randomized house-scale trial between July 1999 and March 2000. Entomological
      impact of four serial doses of bifenthrin (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/m2) sprayed in
      rooms in five villages was compared with malathion (2 g/m2) and unsprayed
      control. An. culicifacies was 100% susceptible to bifenthrin (0.1%), but only 57%
      to malathion (5%) test papers. Contact bioassays were carried out on sprayed
      surfaces for 24 wk, and 24 h mortality in An. culicifacies was recorded.
      Bifenthrin 100- and 200-mg doses caused > or = 80% mortality until 24 wk. The
      50-mg dose caused > or = 80% mortality on tin, wood, and mud surfaces for 24 wk, 
      and on brick walls for 16 wk. Bifenthrin 25-mg dose produced > or = 80% mortality
      for 24 wk on tin, 20 wk on mud walls, 16 wk on brick walls, and 8 wk on wood
      surfaces. Persistence of > or = 80% mortality did not differ for 25- and 50-mg
      doses on any surface except on wood (P < 0.05). Malathion sprayed in three rounds
      of 6 wk apart caused > or = 80% mortality for 16 wk on the brick and mud walls,
      and for 20 wk on the tin and wood surfaces. Bifenthrin 25- and 50-mg doses
      produced a similar impact on the densities of An. culicifacies and other
      mosquitoes but a superior one to malathion or control. Bifenthrin 25-mg dose
      caused least excitorepellency. Overall, efficacy of bifenthrin was superior to
      malathion. Considering the duration of the persistence of significant
      insecticidal action of bifenthrin on the most common surfaces (mud and brick
      walls), least excito-repellency and a relative impact on the mosquito densities, 
      the 25-mg dose was the most superior among all the four doses evaluated.

TI  - Should the use of DDT be revived for malaria vector control?
PG  - 455-61
AB  - Indoor residual spraying with DDT was the principle method by which malaria
      transmission was eradicated or greatly reduced in many countries between the late
      1940s and 1970s. Since then, decreasing use of DDT has been associated with a
      resurgence of malaria in India, Sri Lanka, former Soviet Central Asia, Zanzibar, 
      Venezuela and several other Latin American countries. In India and Zanzibar, DDT 
      resistance in vectors, as well as a decline in spray coverage, are probable
      causes of reduced effectiveness of DDT in recent decades. In southern Europe,
      eradication of malaria transmission was achieved by DDT spraying in the 1940s and
      50s and eradication has been sustained by adequate treatment of imported human
      malaria cases. In the highlands of Madagascar and South Africa, recent reversion 
      to DDT spraying has been successful in stemming resurgences of malaria. Continued
      use of DDT for vector control, but not for agriculture, is approved by the
      Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. DDE residues in breast
      milk have been associated with DDT anti-malaria spraying in South Africa, but it 
      is not known whether this is harmful. A claimed association of DDE residues with 
      breast cancer have not been substantiated. There is a recent report of
      association of DDE residues with probability of premature birth; the possible
      relevance of this to anti-malarial use of DDT should be investigated. In
      Colombia, testing of the DDT stockpile for suspensibility, DDT resistance in
      Anopheles darlingi and investigation of the present affordability of widespread
      spraying with DDT, compared with alternative chemicals, are recommended.

TI  - Isolation of a Pseudomonas fluorescens metabolite/exotoxin active against both
      larvae and pupae of vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 21-4
AB  - A formulation was developed from the metabolite(s) of a novel Pseudomonas
      fluorescens Migula strain (VCRC B426) and tested against 4th-instar larvae and
      pupae of three species of vector mosquitoes, Anopheles stephensi Liston, Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes aegypti (L). The larvae and pupae of An. stephensi
      were the most susceptible to the formulation, followed by those of C.
      quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, in that order, and the dosage requirement for
      pupal mortality was less than that required for larval mortality. The LC50 dosage
      requirements for larvae of these mosquito species were, respectively, 70.4, 511.5
      and 757.3 microg protein ml(-1), whereas for pupae they were, respectively, 2.0, 
      9.4 and 19.2 microg protein ml(-1). The lethal fraction was purified from the
      culture broth and its molecular mass, as determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography, was 44kDa. This is the first report of a microbial formulation
      acting upon mosquito pupae, a non-feeding stage. Its mode of action and efficacy 
      to control mosquitoes under field conditions need to be studied further.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence of Culex vishnui subgroup, the major vectors of Japanese
      encephalitis virus in an endemic district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
PG  - 290-3
AB  - Seasonal prevalence of members of the Culex vishnui subgroup, the major vectors
      of Japanese encephalitis virus (JE) in an endemic district of Andhra Pradesh, was
      investigated. Approximately 15,500 mosquitoes belonging to 2 genera and 5 species
      were collected by indoor-resting collections. The predominant species were found 
      to be from the Cx. vishnui subgroup, which comprised 42.6% of the total
      collection, followed by Anopheles subpictus (40.4%), An. hyrcanus (12.8%), Cx.
      gelidus (3.5%), and An. barbirostris (0.8%). Mosquitoes of the Cx. vishnui
      subgroup were collected throughout the year, and densities of females ranged from
      2.3/man-hour in January 1999 to 26.0/man-hour in December 1999. Ninety-three
      cases of Japanese encephalitis (27 confirmed serologically) were reported, mainly
      during the monsoon months of November and December. A significant positive
      correlation between densities of mosquitoes of the Cx. vishnui subgroup and
      occurrence of Japanese encephalitis cases (r = 0.765, P < 0.01) was observed. The
      factors responsible for transmission of JE in the endemic district are discussed.

TI  - Blocking of malaria parasite development in mosquito and fecundity reduction by
      midgut antibodies in Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 63-70
AB  - Rabbits were immunized three times with extracts of Anopheles stephensi midgut.
      Immunized rabbits showed a high titer of antibodies when characterized by ELISA. 
      We investigated the effect of anti-mosquito midgut antibodies on mosquito
      fecundity, longevity, mortality, engorgement, and the development of the malaria 
      parasite in mosquitoes. Fecundity was reduced significantly (38%) and similarly
      hatchability by about 43.5%. There was no statistically significant effect on
      mortality, longevity, and engorgement. When the mosquito blood meal contained
      anti-midgut antibodies, fewer oocysts of Plasmodium vivax developed in the
      mosquito midgut and the proportion of mosquitoes becoming infected was
      significantly reduced. We also found that the midgut antibodies inhibit the
      development and/or translocation of the sporozoites. Antisera raised against
      midgut of A. stephensi recognized eight polypeptides (110, 92, 70, 45, 38, 29,
      15, 13 kDa) by Western blotting. Cross-reactive antigens/epitopes present in
      other tissues of A. stephensi were also examined both by Western blotting and in 
      vivo ELISA. Together, these observations open an avenue for research toward the
      development of a vector-based malaria parasite transmission blocking vaccine
      and/or anti-mosquito vaccine.

TI  - rDNA-ITS2 based species-diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assay for
      identification of sibling species of Anopheles fluviatilis in Iran.
PG  - 56-60
AB  - A species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers already
      designed, based on differences in the nucleotides of the second internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS2), was used to identify the species composition of the
      Anopheles fluviatilis complex in Iran. All the amplified DNA samples obtained
      from specimens collected from different areas using different collection methods 
      yielded to a fragment of 450 bp size, a PCR product corresponding to the species 
      denoted as Y. Some 21 ITS2 region of Iranian specimens were sequenced and
      compared with the already published sequence data of species Y from India. The
      sequence data of the Iranian specimens were 100% identical to that of the Indian 
      specimens, and hence confirmed the PCR assay results. Species Y is presumably
      species T in India, which has no role in the transmission of malaria, whereas
      mosquitos of An. fluviatilis are known as a secondary vector in Iran. This
      conflict will remain to be solved by further biological and molecular studies.

TI  - Novel cost-effective method of screening soils for the presence of
      mosquito-pathogenic bacilli.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - AIMS: The aim was to simplify the cumbersome conventional process of isolating
      virulent bacilli, which involves isolating all bacilli strains from a source
      followed by screening for strains that are effective for bio-control of mosquito 
      vectors. METHODS: A new simplified technique involving eight steps was devised
      for screening soil samples for the presence of mosquito-pathogenic bacilli before
      isolating individual strains. RESULTS: Using the new technique, we obtained eight
      bacilli strains (KSD1-8) showing pathogenic activity against mosquito larvae from
      three out of 10 soil samples screened. These strains were characterized,
      identified and the main bioassay tests were performed with three most promising
      strains (KSD-4, KSD-7 and KSD-8), and their pathogenic activity against Anopheles
      stephensi Liston, Culex quinquefasciatus, Say and Aedes aegypti Linnaeus compared
      well with commercial reference strains of B. thuringiensis israelensis and B.
      sphaericus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new technique of screening 
      soil samples for the presence of virulent pathogenic strains of bacilli against
      mosquito larvae proved quick, efficient and cost effective.

TI  - Ruby-eye, a new autosomal mutant in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi
      Liston.
PG  - 194-200
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles stephensi, an important vector of malaria
      continues to be distributed widely in the Indian subcontinent. This vector
      species has developed resistance for various insecticides. Therefore, it is
      desirable to develop alternate strategy, which does not involve resistance. In
      order to develop such strategy, it is mandatory that genetic studies of concerned
      vector species should be established. This paper describes the isolation and
      genetic studies of an eye colour mutant, ruby-eye (ru), and linkage studies
      involving another autosomal recessive mutant greyish brown larva (grb ru) in A.
      stephensi. METHODS: The stocks of mutants ruby-eye (ru), greyish brown (grb ru)
      and wild type mosquitoes were maintained in the laboratory. Crosses were made
      between the wild type and mutant to determine the mode of inheritance of
      ruby-eye. For linkage studies crosses were made between the mutant ruby-eye and
      another autosomal recessive mutant greyish brown larva. The percentage cross over
      was calculated for the genes linkage relationship for ru and grb ru. RESULTS:
      Results of crosses between mutant and wild type show that the inheritance of
      ruby-eye in A. stephensi is monofactorial in nature. The ru allele is recessive
      to wild type and is autosomal. The linkage studies showed no linkage between grb 
      and ru. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The mutant ru represents an excellent marker
      for A. stephensi as it expresses in all the life stages with complete penetrance 
      and high viability. This mutant can be used extensively to conduct basic and
      applied research.

TI  - Cloning and characterization of an insecticidal crystal protein gene from
      Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kenyae.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - A sporulating culture of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kenyae strain HD549 is
      toxic to larvae of lepidopteran insect species such as Spodoptera litura,
      Helicoverpa armigera and Phthorimaea operculella, and a dipteran insect, Culex
      fatigans. A 1.9-kb DNA fragment, PCR-amplified from HD549 using
      cryII-gene-specific primers, was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant
      protein produced 92% mortality in first-instar larvae of Spodoptera litura and
      86% inhibition of adult emergence in Phthorimaea operculella, but showed very low
      toxicity against Helicoverpa armigera, and lower mortality against third-instar
      larvae of dipteran insects Culex fatigans, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti.
      The sequence of the cloned crystal protein gene showed almost complete homology
      with a mosquitocidal toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, with
      only five mutations scattered in different regions. Amino acid alignment with
      different insecticidal crystal proteins using the MUTALIN program suggested
      presence of the conserved block 3 region in the sequence of this protein. A
      mutation in codon 409 of this gene that changes a highly conserved phenylalanine 
      residue to serine lies in this block.

TI  - Effect of anti-mosquito hemolymph antibodies on fecundity and on the infectivity 
      of malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax to Anopheles stephensi (Diptera:Insecta).
PG  - 78-82
AB  - Rabbit antibodies to hemolymph antigens (102.5, 101, 100, 96, 88, 80, 64, 55, 43,
      29, and 23 kDa) of Anopheles stephensi reduced fecundity as well as viability in 
      An. stephensi. However, ingestion of these antibodies was not associated with a
      marked effect on the engorgement of mosquitoes but egg laying was significantly
      delayed. Antisera raised against hemolymph proteins were also used to identify
      cross reactive antigens/epitopes present in other tissues by Western blotting, as
      well as by in vivo ELISA. In addition, a significant reduction in oocyst
      development was also observed in An. stephensi mosquitoes that ingested
      anti-hemolymph antibodies along with Plasmodium vivax. The results confirmed the 
      feasibility of targeting mosquito antigens as a novel anti-mosquito strategy, as 
      well as confirmed the usefulness of such antigens for the development of a
      transmission-blocking vaccine.

TI  - Malaria outbreak in the Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojna command area in Jaisalmer
      district, Thar Desert, India.
PG  - 88-95
AB  - A focal outbreak of malaria occurred in the villages situated close to the main
      Indira Gandhi canal near Ramgarh in Jaisalmer district, western Rajasthan.
      Stagnation of water over a month's period in the main canal as well as long
      standing rain water in the form of expansive lakes near these villages formed
      vast breeding grounds for the vectors like Anopheles culicifacies, along with A. 
      stephensi already breeding in the 'tanka' and 'beri' in the epidemichit villages.
      Rapid mass blood surveys along with other entomological and parasitological
      investigations were conducted in four of the ten affected villages, viz., Seuva, 
      Raghwa, Raimala and Sadhna. A total of 992 specimens belonging to four vector
      species were sampled, namely, A. stephensi (47.4%), A. culicifacies (41.0%), A.
      subpictus (11.2%) and A. annularis (0.4%). Epidemiologically, about one-fourth of
      the examined persons were positive (SPR 25.5%), although Plasmodium falciparum
      dominated the parasitaemia (49.5%). Available data are indicative of changed
      malariological scenario in the Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojna command area, where 
      epidemics are regular features every year.

AB  - Toxicity of selected larvicidal formulations of Bacillus sphaericus, Bacillus
      thuringiensis H-14 israelensis (Bti) and insect growth regulators was determined 
      against Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti, the two major urban mosquito
      vectors of malaria and dengue fever in India respectively. The study revealed
      that the formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 and IGR compounds were
      highly toxic against both the mosquito species but Bacillus sphaericus
      formulation was less toxic against Aedes aegypti and has a limited potential for 
      use against Aedes aegypti. Of the two Bti formulations, 'Vectobac' formulation
      was more toxic against both the species than 'BMP-1442X' formulation. Bti
      formulations were more toxic against Aedes aegypti (LC50 = 0.06 and 0.14
      mg/Litre) than against An. stephensi (LC50 = 0.14 and 0.81 mg/Litre), while B.
      sphaericus formulation was more toxic against An. stephensi LC50 = 0.031 mg/Litre
      than Aedes aegypti LC50 = 0.294 mg/Litre. Among different larvicidal formulations
      tested in this study, IGR compounds were found to be toxic against both the
      mosquito species at very low concentrations (EC50 values ranging between 0.0001
      and 0.0004 ppm).

TI  - Dynamics of malaria transmission under changing ecological scenario in and around
      Nanak Matta Dam, Uttaranchal, India.
PG  - 91-8
AB  - To understand the transmission dynamics of malaria in three different ecotypes,
      namely watershed (forest), seepage (Nanak Matta Dam) and plain (non-forest,
      non-dam) areas of Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts of Uttaranchal,
      entomological and parasitological investigations were carried out from July 1996 
      to June 1997. In the three ecotypes, average per man hour densities of adult
      vector species in human dwellings and cattlesheds recorded were high for
      Anopheles culicifacies from April to September and October to March for An.
      fluviatilis. Prevalence of both An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis was higher
      in the forest area as compared to other two areas. Observations on gonotrophic
      condition revealed endophilic tendency of both vector species. Higher number of
      both vector species were found in outdoor than indoor during night human bait
      collections. Out of 864 specimens of An. fluviatilis dissected, one showed
      natural infection of sporozoites in salivary glands in the month of November from
      the forest area only. Sibling species study of An. fluviatilis revealed the
      presence of species S for the first time in the forest area. Parasitological
      investigations also depicted high incidence of malaria in the forest area as
      compared to other two areas. Overall results from the study indicated active
      malaria transmission in the forest area.

PG  - 84-90
AB  - A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study conducted in 173 tribal residents
      (including all age groups) from three villages of Sundergarh district of Orissa
      using ELISA as a tool revealed high levels of antibody titres against both AR1
      and Pf antigens. The mean +/- S.D. ELISA O.D. obtained for AR1 were 0.73 +/- 0.2,
      1.037 +/- 0.196, 1.05 +/- 0.42 and for Pf, 0.70 +/- 0.2, 1.0 +/- 0.28, 0.94 +/-
      0.4 respectively for Badramoli, Jharbeda and Boneikela population.
      Parasitological results showed high incidence of malaria in < 5 years age group
      in Badramoli and Boneikela villages when compared to other age groups. An.
      fluviatilis was found to be the principle malaria vector as found in the HBI
      results. High ELISA O.D. and high equivalent transmission index (ETI) indicate a 
      high malaria transmission in the area. Seroepidemiological studies could be used 
      for effective surveillance and stratification of endemicity in a given area which
      can help in executing intervention strategy for malaria control.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on bionomics of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi in
      Delhi.
PG  - 61-75
AB  - Study on bionomics of malaria vectors was carried out in riverine and
      non-riverine areas, on account of tremendous ecological changes in the topography
      of Delhi. The densities of adult anophelines were estimated by two techniques,
      hand catch and total catch index. Percentage of An. stephensi (15.68) collected
      by both the techniques was more than An. culicifacies (3.16) in both the areas.
      Day-time resting preferences of vector species in human dwellings and cattlesheds
      did not differ significantly. Preferred larval habitats of An. culicifacies in
      riverine area shifted to large lakes, channels and ponds. In malaria
      transmission, An. culicifacies played a role only in the northern part of the
      riverine area where water pollution was at minimal level, while An. stephensi
      played an equal role in the malaria transmission in both the areas. High
      sporozoite rates were found in type form of An. stephensi in localities where its
      proportion was high, thus confirming its active role in malaria transmission. The
      overall sporozoite rate of vectors was 0.7 per cent and P. falciparum sporozoite 
      infections of the vectors were detected in An. stephensi only. P. vivax and P.
      falciparum infections were found in the ratio of 68:32. The non-riverine area was
      more malarious than the riverine area.

TI  - Investigation of malaria outbreak in Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh.
PG  - 186-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Based on the reports of 139 fever related deaths in
      Jarwal primary health centre (PHC) of Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh (UP)
      during April to September 1999, a study was undertaken to explore the possibility
      of outbreak of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the area and reasons of outbreak.
      METHODS: The study was undertaken during September-October 1999 in Bahraich
      district, UP. The study included a parasitological and an entomological survey.
      Blood slides from fever cases were collected and examined following standard
      procedures for detection of species and stage of parasite. The resting adult
      mosquitoes were collected from human dwellings and cattle sheds from selected
      villages. Susceptibility status of Anopheles culicifacies to 4 per cent DDT and
      0.05 per cent deltamethrin was determined under laboratory conditions following
      the WHO procedure. In vitro drug sensitivity of P. falciparum to chloroquine was 
      also estimated. RESULTS: Overall slide positivity rate (SPR) was found to be 33.8
      with a preponderance of P. falciparum (88.4%). There was an outbreak of Pf
      malaria in Jarwal and surrounding areas as well. Foci of P. falciparum malaria
      were found in Jarwal, Fakharpur and Hazoorpur PHCs around Kaisarganj PHC. In
      addition, P. falciparum cases, were also reported from Motipur and Tejwapur.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Poor surveillance of affected areas resulting in low
      annual parasite incidence (API), lack of insecticidal spray in the currently
      affected PHCs as the API was less than 2 and development of resistance in P.
      falciparum to chloroquine were found as the possible reasons for the outbreak. It
      is recommended that surveillance be strengthened in all PHCs of Bahraich district
      to contain further extension of malaria in northeastern UP.

PG  - 32-8
AB  - Epidemiological investigations were conducted in Nellie subcentre, PHC Jhargaon, 
      under Morigaon district (Assam). The results of fever cases revealed 68 per cent 
      slide positivity rate (SPR) and 40 per cent slide falciparum rate (SfR). The Pf
      proportion was > 87 per cent and remaining cases were P. vivax infections. An.
      minimus was incriminated as a malaria vector during the study period. The
      sporozoite rate was 3.08 per cent. The indoor man mosquito contact was 35 per
      bait/night as against 23 in outdoors. Results of susceptibility test revealed
      that the vector was still susceptible to both DDT and malathion at discriminating
      dosages. The study revealed that inadequate surveillance and vector control
      measures were contributing factors for malaria outbreak. In view of this,
      insecticide treated nets may be introduced to provide cost-effective control of
      malaria.

      infection (Pv + Pf = 1.05 per cent). Malaria cases were recorded throughout the
      year in all the age groups including infants, however, age groups between 0-1 and
      21-30 years were more affected. Among 17 anophelines collected, Anopheles vagus, 
      An. jamesii, An. crawfordi and An. minimus were the most abundant species. Known 
      vectors of malaria like An. annularis, An. culicifacies, An. minimus, An.
      philippinensis and An. varuna were detected. Perennial transmission of malaria
      was attributed to low socio-economic conditions, poor surveillance and inadequate
      intervention measures.

TI  - Susceptibility of the mosquitoes Anopheles minimus, An. sinensis, and An. saperoi
      (Diptera: Culicidae) from the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, to the rodent malaria
      Plasmodium yoelii nigeriense.
PG  - 146-51
AB  - The susceptibility of three anopheline mosquitoes, Anopheles minimus Theobald,
      An. sinensis Wiedemann, and An. saperoi Bohart & Ingram, from the Ryukyu
      Archipelago to the rodent malaria, Plasmodium yoelii nigeriense was examined to
      find new vectors other than An. stephensi Liston for rodent malaria studies in
      the laboratory. The survival rate of the mosquitoes after feeding on mice
      infected with P. y. nigeriense was also examined. The Beech strain of An.
      stephensi from India was compared with An. minimus from Ishigaki Island, and An. 
      sinensis and An. saperoi from Okinawa Island. Oocysts were first found on day 3
      after feeding on mice infected with P. y. nigeriense in An. stephensi, on day 4
      in An. minimus and An. saperoi, and day 6 in An. sinensis. From 8 to 14 d after
      feeding on malaria-positive mice, oocysts were present in 97.2-100% of An.
      stephensi, 85.7-100% of An. saperoi, 20-74.1% of An. minimus, and 12.5-13.3% of
      An. sinensis. The duration of oocyst occurrence in An. saperoi was 55 d, the
      longest among the anopheline mosquitoes used in this study. On day 8 after
      feeding, sporozoites were found in the salivary glands and heads of all the
      mosquitoes tested. From the 10th to 16th d, sporozoites were present in the
      salivary glands of 14.9% (range, 9.1-28.0%) of An. minimus, 47.3% (40.7-58.1) of 
      An. saperoi, and 96.2% (94.1-97.2) of An. stephensi, but were absent in An.
      sinensis. Anopheles saperoi could be an excellent vector of P. y. nigeriense
      because it has comparatively high susceptibility and high longevity even after
      feeding on infected mice.

TI  - Malaria control: achievements, problems and strategies.
PG  - 1-89
AB  - Even if history has not always been the Magistra vitae, Cicero expected it to be,
      it should provide, as Baas said, a mirror in which to observe and compare the
      past and present in order to draw therefrom well-grounded conclusions for the
      future. Based on this belief, this paper aims to provide an overview of the
      foundations and development of malaria control policies during the XX century. It
      presents an analysis of the conflicting tendencies which shaped the development
      of these policies and which appear to have oscillated between calls for frontal
      attack in an all-out campaign and calls for sustainable gains, even if slow. It
      discusses the various approaches to the control of malaria, their achievements
      and their limitations, not only to serve as a background to understand better the
      foundations of current policies, but also to prevent that simplistic
      generalisations may again lead to exaggerated expectations and disillusion. The
      first part of the paper is devoted to the development of malaria control during
      the first half of the century, characterised by the ups and downs in the reliance
      on mosquito control as the control measure applicable everywhere. The
      proliferation of "man-made-malaria", which accompanied the push for economic
      development in most of the endemic countries, spurred the need for control
      interventions and, while great successes were obtained in many specific projects,
      the general campaigns proposed by the enthusiasts of vector control faced
      increasing difficulties in their practical implementation in the field. Important
      events, which may be considered representative of this period are, on the
      campaign approach, the success of Gorgas in the Panama Canal, but also the
      failure of the Mian Mir project in India; while on the developmental approach,
      the Italian and Dutch schools of malariology, the Tennessee Valley and the
      development of malaria sanitation, included the so called species sanitation. The
      projection of these developments to a global scale was steered by the Malaria
      Commission of the League of Nations and greatly supported by the Rockefeller
      Foundation. Perhaps the most important contribution of this period was the
      development of malaria epidemiology, including the study of the genesis of
      epidemics and their possible forecasting and prevention. Although the great
      effectiveness of DDT was perhaps the main determinant for proposing the global
      eradication of the disease in the 1950s, it was the confidence in the
      epidemiological knowledge and the prestige of malariology, which gave credibility
      to the proposal at the political level. The second part deals with the global
      malaria eradication campaign of the 1950s and 1960s. It recognises the enormous
      impact of the eradication effort in the consolidation of the control successes of
      the first half of the century, as well as its influence in the development of
      planning of health programmes. Nevertheless, it also stresses the negative
      influence that the failure to achieve its utopian expectations had on the general
      disappointment and slow progress of malaria control, which characterised the last
      third of the century. The paper then analyses the evolution of malaria control
      funding, which often appears out of tune with political statements. The fourth
      part is devoted to the search for realistic approaches to malaria control,
      leading to the adoption of the global malaria control strategy in Amsterdam in
      1992, and the challenge, at the end of the century, to rally forces commensurate 
      with the magnitude of the problem, while aiming at realistic objectives. After
      discussing the conflicting views on the relations between malaria and
      socio-economic development and the desirable integration of malaria control into 
      sustainable development, the paper ends with some considerations on the
      perspectives of malaria control, as seen by the author in early 1998, just before
      the launching of the current Roll Back Malaria initiative by WHO.

      malaria.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Two fever surveys were carried out in Shahbad dairy, Delhi in the post-monsoon
      months of October and November, 1996. Shahbad dairy is a peri-urban locality in
      the northern periphery of Delhi. The prevalence of fever was found to be 11.6% in
      October and 2% in November. In the two surveys a total of 21 (28%) fever cases
      were found infected with malaria (17 with P. falciparum and 4 with P. vivax). The
      prevalence of malaria in the surveyed population was lower (25%) in October than 
      in November (36.8%). More adults and males suffered from malaria than other age
      groups and the females. In November the mean asexual parasitaemia, for P.
      falciparum infection, sharply declined among 5-14-years old children by 68%, but 
      among adults it increased by 32%. Collection of adult mosquitoes, from human
      houses, revealed the presence of 5 species of anopheline mosquitoes comprising
      Anopheles culicifacies, An. stephensi, An. annularis, An. subpictus, and An.
      nigerrimus, and a culicine mosquito Culex vishnui complex. Extensive breeding of 
      these mosquitoes was detected in the vicinity of Shahbad dairy. Characteristic
      ecological support system (ESS) for malaria transmission was identified at the
      peri-urban focus of Shahbad dairy.

TI  - Entomological and epidemiological studies on malaria in Rajmahal range, Bihar.
PG  - 88-96
AB  - The epidemiological investigations carried out in six tribal villages in Rajmahal
      range hill in south Bihar revealed average slide positivity rate (SPR) 25.1
      ranging between 9.8 and 37.8 per cent. Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant
      parasite which accounted 64.2 per cent of the total infections. Results of mass
      blood survey indicated the presence of high percentage of asymptomatic carriers
      of malaria parasites in the local populace. In an entomological survey, 25
      species of mosquitoes under five genera were collected in 20 trap nights. The
      average density of mosquitoes recorded was 230.6 per trap night. Anopheles
      mosquitoes alone accounted 72.8 per cent of the total collection whereas malaria 
      vectors Anopheles maculatus, An. minimus, An. philippinensis, An. varuna and An. 
      annularis accounted 32.8 per cent of the total anophelines collected. Both
      anopheline and culicine mosquitoes were found susceptible to DDT (4 per cent) and
      malathion (5 per cent) in 30 min exposure. Dissection of malaria vectors An.
      minimus, An. maculatus and An. philippinensis revealed very high percentage of
      parity rate (77.8 per cent) which gives a strong indication about their vectorial
      status in the transmission of malaria. Poor socio-economic condition, lack of
      sense of hygiene worsen the situation in the presence of asymptomatic carriers.

PG  - 18-26
AB  - A study was conducted during 'Kuruvai' crop season from December 1992 to January 
      1993 in the rice fields of the Agricultural College and Research Institute,
      Madurai, Tamil Nadu to determine the influence of plant spacing and plant canopy 
      on the populations of mosquito immatures. Three paddy varieties (ADT36, IR50 and 
      IR20) were selected with two types of plant spacing, one with normal spacing (15 
      x 10 cm) and another wider (20 x 15 cm) than the normal spacing. Results showed
      that the field planted with normal spacing of paddy had significantly higher
      populations of culicine and anopheline immatures than the fields planted with
      wider spacing of paddy. The paddy varieties did not have any significant effect
      on the population of mosquito immatures. Light intensity, measured at the water
      surface using an illuminometer, was inversely related to the development of plant
      canopy and the results suggested that plant canopy does not inhibit oviposition
      by mosquitoes in the early stages of paddy growth, but it was responsible for the
      decline in the populations in the later stages of paddy growth. The plant spacing
      had a significant effect on the populations of chironomids and libellulids and
      other insects were not affected significantly.

TI  - Operational feasibility and efficacy of deltamethrin impregnated hessian curtains
      in comparison to HCH indoor residual spraying to control malaria in selected
      villages of District Ghaziabad (U.P.), India.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - A study was carried out in selected villages of District Ghaziabad to evaluate
      the operational feasibility and efficacy of hessian curtains impregnated with
      deltamethrin@100 mg/m2 in comparison to indoor residual spraying of HCH@0.2 g/m2.
      The impregnation was carried out before onset of transmission and observations
      were continued up to two transmission periods. District Health Authorities have
      carried out HCH indoor residual spraying (IRS) as per schedule in the control
      village. Entomological evaluation revealed 87 per cent reduction of An.
      culicifacies up to six months in comparison to HCH indoor residual spraying.
      However, the reduction in densities of total mosquitoes was only 61.6 per cent.
      Follow-up studies revealed that the impact of deltamethrin impregnated curtains
      was diluted after 6-7 months. The results of bioassay tests revealed 100 per cent
      mortality up to 6-7 months. Epidemiological evaluation revealed 81.9 per cent
      reduction in total malaria cases as against 88.5 per cent with P. falciparum
      cases. Similar reduction was also observed when slide positivity rate (SPR),
      slide falciparum rate (SfR), cases/000 and Pf/000 were compared to corresponding 
      village. Pilot studies are indicated to evaluate the relative efficacy of
      impregnated curtains, which is quite cheaper than conventional residual
      insecticide spraying (IRS).

AB  - Epidemiologic investigations revealed a 56.7 and 13.32% slide positivity rate in 
      febrile and afebrile malaria cases, respectively. In both cases, Plasmodium
      falciparum was predominant. Anopheles culicifacies resistant to
      dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and benzene hexachloride (hexachlorocyclohexane) 
      was found breeding profusely in pools and ponds created by excavation of earth
      around brick kiln in the region. Furthermore, children were not found to be
      producing significant levels of antibodies and a large percentage of patients
      harbored chloroquine-resistant parasites. Also, more than 1 P. falciparum strain 
      was present in the population. We detected 2 strains, VI and VII, of which type
      VI was predominant.

TI  - Adaptation of a strain of Plasmodium vivax from India to New World monkeys,
      chimpanzees, and anopheline mosquitoes.
PG  - 1398-403
AB  - A strain of Plasmodium vivax from India was adapted to develop in splenectomized 
      Saimiri boliviensis, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, A vociferans, A. nancymai, A. 
      azarae boliviensis, hybrid Aotus monkeys, and splenectomized chimpanzees.
      Infections were induced via the inoculation of sporozoites dissected from the
      salivary glands of Anopheles stephensi and An. dirus mosquitoes to 12 Aotus and 8
      Saimiri monkeys; transmission via the bites of infected An. stephensi was made to
      1 Aotus monkey and 1 chimpanzee. The intravenous passage of infected erythrocytes
      was made to 9 Aotus monkeys and 4 chimpanzees. Gametocytes in 13 Aotus monkeys
      and 4 chimpanzees were infectious to mosquitoes. Infection rates were markedly
      higher in mosquitoes fed on chimpanzees. PCR studies on 10 monkeys injected with 
      sporozoites revealed the presence of parasites before their detection by
      microscopic examination. The India VII strain of P. vivax develops in Aotus and
      Saimiri monkeys and chimpanzees following the injection of parasitized
      erythrocytes, or sporozoites, or both. The transmission rate via sporozoites to
      New World monkeys of approximately 50% may be too low for the testing of
      sporozoite vaccines or drugs directed against the exoerythrocytic stages.
      However, the strain is highly infectious to commonly available
      laboratory-maintained anopheline mosquitoes. Mosquito infection is especially
      high when feedings are made with gametocytes from splenectomized chimpanzees.

AB  - Ronald Ross discovered that the plasmodium parasite--'Laveran's germ'--was
      transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes to human beings to cause malaria. This
      discovery won him a Nobel Prize in 1902, but the route to this success was by no 
      means clear. He was an indifferent student, he liked to write novels and poems
      and only just managed to gain a medical qualification. Fortuitously he was
      mediocre enough to enter the least prestigious section of the Indian Medical
      Service, which put him directly in contact with the parasites that were to become
      his passion. Despite honours being showered on him, life after the Prize also was
      not straightforward, he was irrascible and his innovative mathematical and
      economic approaches to disease control were overlooked.

TI  - Oviposition attractancy of an infusion from a wood inhabiting fungus for vector
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 18-24
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Review of literature indicates that none of the
      chemicals so far studied for oviposition attractancy was found to be promising
      for operational use. Efforts are being made to find an effective substance to
      corner a large number of ovipositing females to selective breeding sites for ease
      of control operation. This will reduce insecticidal consumption and will be
      cost-effective. This study is aimed to evaluate the oviposition attractancy of
      aqueous infusion from a wood inhabiting fungus (Polyporus spp.) for vector
      mosquitoes both in the laboratory and under field conditions. METHODS: An aqueous
      infusion (10%) was prepared by soaking 10 g of fungal powder in 100 ml of
      chlorine-free tap water. The mixture was shaken thoroughly and filtered through
      Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The filtered infusion was tested for oviposition
      attractancy against vector mosquitoes both in the laboratory and under field
      conditions. RESULTS: The laboratory study on the dose-effect relationship
      indicated that at an optimum concentration of 4 ppm, maximum attractancy was
      observed. Water treated with aqueous fungal infusion (AFI) at 4 ppm received
      significantly more egg rafts/eggs of vector mosquitoes than other substrates like
      rearing water, natural breeding water and tap water. Trials conducted in the
      field showed that mud pots treated with AFI placed in both indoor and outdoor
      locations received significantly more Aedes aegypti eggs than the control.
      Similarly, treated pots placed in paddy fields attracted significantly more
      gravid Anopheles subpictus for oviposition than untreated pots. In contrast, the 
      number of egg rafts of Culex quinquefasciatus laid in AFI treated pots was
      significantly less than in the control ones owing to strong natural olfactory
      factors associated with the breeding habitat. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The
      results indicated that there is scope for developing a trap incorporating this
      oviposition attractant along with insect growth regulator(s) (IGR) for
      surveillance and/or control of Ae. aegypti and other vector mosquitoes breeding
      in paddy fields.

TI  - Anti-mosquito ovary antibodies reduce the fecundity of Anopheles stephensi
      (Diptera:Insecta).
PG  - 181-3
AB  - Rabbit antibodies to five antigens (AJ** 29, 35, 43, 64, and 80 kDa) derived from
      the ovaries of Anopheles stephensi tended to reduce the number of eggs produced. 
      Ingestion of anti-mosquito ovary antibodies did not show a detectable effect on
      the mortality of mosquitoes. Antisera raised against An. stephensi ovaries showed
      cross-reactivity in other tissues and in the ovaries of other Anopheles spp. by
      Western blotting. The results indicate that anti-mosquito ovary antibodies have
      the potential to disrupt the reproductive physiology of mosquitoes, and indicate 
      the need for further studies with target antigens.

TI  - Deltamethrin treated bednets for control of malaria transmitted by Anopheles
      culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae) in India.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - In a malaria endemic area in Orissa state in eastern India baseline (November
      1989 to October 1990) malaria incidence ranged front 215 to 328 cases/1,000
      population/yr in different groups of villages. In November 1990, nylon bednets
      treated with deltamethrin at 25 mg/m2 were given out in two villages (population 
      1062), untreated bednets were given out in five villages (population 1,226) and
      in one village (population 786) nets were not given. Nets were retreated in
      October 1991 and June 1992 in treated-net villages. The trial continued until
      October 1992. The treated nets caused significant reduction in indoor resting
      density, biting (landing), light trap catches, human engorgement rate, and parous
      rate of malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies Giles as compared with untreated
      nets or no nets. Untreated nets also caused reductions in biting and indoor
      density. Treated nets retained insecticidal action well over 6 mo. In the final
      year, malaria incidence was reduced 8.9% in the no-net village, 34.9% in the
      villages with untreated nets, and 59.1% in villages with treated nets. The
      relative risk of malaria and parasite rates declined significantly in villages
      with treated nets. Pediatric splenomegaly rate did not change in the no-net
      village, increased significantly in villages with untreated nets, but decreased
      significantly in those with treated nets. Treated nets also reduced pediatric
      anemia rates, but Hb concentration increased in all villages. Considering the
      benefits of treated bednets and development of resistance among vectors to DDT
      and malathion, bednets treated with deltamethrin could be an effective
      alternative strategy to control malaria in forested areas in India.

LID - 10.1016/S0377-1237(01)80005-8 [doi]
AB  - An epidemiological study on the transmission of malaria was carried out in an Air
      Force (AF) station located in a densely forested, highly malarious tribal belt in
      Central India. Among the AF station population, Defence Service Corps (DSC)
      personnel, whose occupation involved night patrolling in densely forested locales
      on the perimeter of the AF station, with the tribal villages within flight range 
      of the vector mosquitoes, were the group most affected in terms of both overall
      malaria incidence and high falciparum rates. Among the neighbouring villages, the
      tribal villages had significantly higher rates of malaria as compared to the
      non-tribal villages. Vector identification revealed the presence of malaria
      vectors Anopheles culicifacies and A fluviatilis. Heavy breeding was noted in the
      surrounding villages, both in natural water channels and man made projects, such 
      as installation of village hand pumps without proper drainage. A rising trend of 
      malaria was obvious in these villages. Incidence among the service population
      could be controlled to some extent by specifically targeted measures inside the
      camp area. Strategy for controlling malaria in such endemic pockets has been
      discussed.

      countries is almost 6500 km long. To the south, Kazakhstan shares a border with
      the Central Asian states of Turkmenistan (380 km), Uzbekistan (2300 km) and
      Kyrgystan (980 km). To the south-east, it shares a border with China (1460 km):
      to the west is the Caspian Sea (600 km). Thus, the total length of Kazakhstan's
      external borders is 12,000 km. Because of the geographical, natural and climatic 
      features prevailing throughout most of the Republic, there is a potential danger 
      that local transmission of malaria may begin again if the disease is imported
      from abroad. The areas most at risk are the Panfilov and Uigur raions of Almaty
      oblast, which share a border with malaria-endemic regions of China, and the
      Saryagash and Makhtaral' raions of South Kazakhstan oblast along the border with 
      Uzbekistan. The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan places particular
      emphasis on malaria prevention and control, taking into account the historical
      data about the prevalence of malaria from the late 1920s to the early 1940s,
      amounting to hundreds of thousands of cases every year. Government Decree No. 840
      entitled "Urgent Measures to Protect the Population from Blood-Sucking Insects
      and Ticks Dangerous to Humans", which lays down measures for the control of
      malarial mosquitoes in the areas most susceptible to malaria resurgence, was
      adopted in 1996. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan issued
      instructions in 1998 and 1999 which were designed to motivate all health
      facilities in the field of malaria prevention and control. At present, as part of
      the directives developed by the Republican Health Epidemiology Posts, work is
      being done on the planning of malaria control measures in Kazakhstan for the
      period 2001-2003. In 1994 a programme of epidemiological malaria surveillance was
      introduced, which has enabled us to improve our monitoring of the epidemiological
      situation of malaria. The number of cases of imported malaria has declined: in
      1997, there were 102 cases, in 1998-87 and in 1999-52. There have been occasional
      local cases in some years, and in 1998 there were four local cases in the south
      and north-west of the country: two cases in Almaty oblast, one case in Zhambyl
      oblast and one in West Kazakhstan oblast (see Fig. 1). Most malaria infections
      are imported from Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, with occasional cases from Pakistan,
      India, Turkey and Afghanistan. Analysis of the occupational status of patients
      shows that around 45% are military personnel who have served on the Tajik-Afghan 
      border. The others are refugees, merchants, unemployed people or students. The
      overall aetiological structure of malaria cases is dominated by P. vivax malaria.
      For example, in 1999, there were 48 cases of P. vivax malaria (90.5% of the
      total), one case of tropical malaria (1.9%), two cases of quartan malaria (3.8%) 
      and two cases of P. vivax + P. malariae (3.8%). In order to prevent indigenous
      malaria occurring within the country, a system of malaria screening has been set 
      up; screening is carried out every year on groups who have visited neighbouring
      or more distant malaria-endemic countries and for patients with a persistent
      fever who are suspected of suffering from malaria. The area of water throughout
      the country within communities or within a 3-5 km radius of them which is
      susceptible to colonization by the Anopheles mosquito amounts to over 5000
      hectares, according to the certification system in force. In addition,
      approximately 70,000 hectares in three oblasts used for rice cultivation also
      provide a habitat for Anopheles. The main malaria vector, An. messeae, is found
      throughout the country: in a few areas An. hyrcanus and An. claviger are found
      and, in the south, An. pulcherrimus. Data from recent years show the presence of 
      An. superpictus, An. plumbeus and An. algeriensis. In 1999, from data collected
      during systematic observations of the phenology and seasonal variations in the
      number of Anopheles at 114 observation posts, the average seasonal numerical
      indicators for the mosquito imago reached a maximum of between 21 and 46.5 adult 
      mosquitoes per cattle shed, up to 2.7-3.3 adult mosquitoes per residential
      building and 30-67.3 larvae per square metre of surface water. According to the
      results of large scale trapping programmes (486 communities were screened in
      1999), the maximum value of the numerical indicator was 16.8-74.1 adult
      mosquitoes per cattle shed and 4.1-3.8 adult mosquitoes per residential building.
      In 1999, compared with 1998, the number of malarial mosquitoes detected
      throughout the country declined encouragingly, or stayed at the same level, which
      is one of the factors responsible for the country's favourable epidemiological
      situation with regard to malaria. According to data going back many years, there 
      has been a significant increase in the number of mosquitoes at some observation
      posts in Almaty, East Kazakhstan and Kyzlorda oblasts. There is a tendency
      everywhere for the numbers of imagos detected in residential buildings to
      increase, which presents a definite epidemiological risk that indigenous malaria 
      will re-emerge if the disease is imported into Kazakhstan from countries which
      suffer from it. If we consider the species of mosquito present in the country and
      the temperature factor (the number of days in the year when the average daily
      temperature is over 16 degrees C), the country can be divided, on the basis of
      incomplete 1999 data, into zones at very high risk of re-emergence of malaria
      (Almaty, Zhambyl and South Kazakhstan oblasts), high risk (Karaganda oblasts and 
      Almaty city), medium risk (Aktyubinsk and Akmolinsk oblasts), and low risk
      (Kostanay oblast). The malaria risk of the other oblasts has been calculated
      using data from earlier years (map attached) [Translator's Note: map missing].
      Preventive malaria control measures in Kazakhstan are divided into three
      categories to suit three different groups of communities. One hundred and
      seventy-nine communities have been allocated to the first group, at high risk of 
      malaria resurgence; 1377 communities to the second group, at medium risk; and the
      remainder to the third group, at little or no risk of malaria resurgence. The
      following factors were used to categorize communities according to the risk that 
      malaria might become reestablished if the disease should be imported from
      elsewhere: species of malarial mosquito present; changes in mosquito numbers and 
      in the area of water susceptible to population by Anopheles; temperature
      conditions and, consequently, the length of the malaria transmission season and
      the season of effective susceptibility of the mosquito to infection; population
      migration; quality of laboratory testing for the diagnosis of malaria. Measures
      aimed at the destruction of mosquitoes are intended to reduce the numbers of
      Anopheles in the communities most at risk of malaria resurgence, i.e. those in
      group 1 above and the actual foci of malaria infection. Because of the economic
      crisis and financial difficulties, fewer areas have been treated in recent years.
      In 1999, 1387 hectares of water and 450,000 square metres of buildings were
      treated (see Fig. 2). Measures to control biting flies in health establishments, 
      recreation areas, etc. Certainly also help to protect people from malarial
      mosquitoes. In 1999, 12,501 hectares of water and land were treated from the
      ground or the air (see Fig. 3). In the present situation, the main reasons for
      the difficulties affecting the malaria control and prevention campaign are as
      follows. Staff numbers in the Republic's parasitology service have been
      unjustifiably reduced. For example, the number of entomologists and entomology
      assistants employed is 58% and 48%, respectively, of the number laid down in
      Ministry of Health directives. At the health epidemiology posts, the number of
      disinfectors has been reduced to a minimum, and practically all engineer/water
      engineer posts have been abolished. The country does not possess the necessary
      education base for initial training or continuing education of staff for the
      parasitology service. The lack of basic scientific information about the problems
      of malaria control and prevention and parasitology in general. There is no
      research to test or introduce the most effective, safe and low-cost malaria
      control products and insecticides. The methodological literature required to use 
      certain modern insecticides is not available. Entomologists are not provided with
      specialist insect control equipment. Entomological surveys are left incomplete
      because of shortages of transport and fuel at the health epidemiology posts.
      Because of the economic crisis and the high cost of the radical water engineering
      measures necessary to combat malaria, these measures cannot be implemented on the
      scale required. The equipment and materials stocks of the parasitology
      laboratories are highly inadequate: there is a lack of modern laboratory
      equipment, as well as a lack of opportunities for high-level professional
      training for staff. The exchange of information between the CIS countries is
      unsatisfactory, and there is no common information space: nor is there any
      systematic data available from other foreign countries. In the period 2000-2003, 
      Kazakhstan plans to carry out malaria control activities (mosquito destruction)
      over an area of 2000 hectares of water and 1.5 million square metres of
      buildings.

      parasite Plasmodium.
PG  - 287-90
AB  - Innate immune-related polypeptides expression in midgut in the ageing vector
      mosquito A. stephensi following infection by malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii 
      yoelii has been studied. Twenty polypeptides were induced by an infected blood
      meal during various stages of adult life. A 24 kDa polypeptide was induced
      generally in most of the stages. Maximum parasite induced polypeptides i.e. 22,
      33, 111, 122, 127, 140, 143 and 146 kDa were found in 5 days of post blood
      feeding (PBF) which coincides with the presence of oocysts on the midgut.
      However, in addition, three polypeptides in 11 days PBF and 8 polypeptides in 20 
      days PBF were also induced due to parasite infection in aged mosquitoes.
      Quantitatively, the amount of soluble proteins in the midgut in
      oocyst-sporozoite-positive mosquitoes was always less as compared to their normal
      counterparts. The parasite evidently elicits defined immune responses by inducing
      specific polypeptides in the midgut of the mosquito.

TI  - Concurrent control of mosquitoes and domestic pests by use of
      deltamethrin-treated curtains in the New Delhi Municipal Committee, India.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - A field trial was conducted in Block F of the Moti Bagh area of New Delhi
      Municipal Committee to demonstrate composite control of Anopheles stephensi and
      Aedes aegypti by spraying deltamethrin at 100 mg/m2 on window and door curtains
      of habitations. Results revealed drastic reduction (87.9-93.7%, P < 0.05) of
      target species in the experimental area. The impact of deltamethrin-treated
      curtains was also evident against nontarget species (67.9-85.7%. P < 0.05).
      Treated curtains provided 100% kill of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti for 3-4
      months, followed by a gradual decline in successive months. Use of
      deltamethrin-treated curtains resulted in 92.0 reduction in slide positivity rate
      and 95.4% reduction in malaria cases per thousand population. The cost of
      deltamethrin treatment was Rs 41.15 (<$1 U.S.) per house per annum.
      Insecticide-treated mosquito window and door curtains, along with legislative
      measures, may provide cost-effective concurrent control of mosquitoes and other
      domestic pests.

      mosquito, among the residents of an area where filariasis is endemic:
      relationship with the mosquito densities.
PG  - 399-403
AB  - Attempts were made to correlate the numbers of indoor-resting Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Armigeres theobold and Anopheles vagus in Raipur, Chattisgarh
      state, India, with the seroprevalences, among the city's microfilaraemic and
      'endemic normal' residents, of antibodies reacting with thoracic proteins from
      the adult females of each of these species. Overall, 6478 female mosquitoes were 
      collected in about 176 man-hours spread over a 12-month period. Antibodies to Cx.
      quniquefasciatus, the commonest species and the only one to be prevalent in all
      seasons of the year, were detected in 90% of the microfilaraemic subjects and 27%
      of the endemic normal. Although Armigeres theobold only constituted 5% of the
      mosquitoes collected, 96% of the microfilaraemic subjects and 69% of the endemic 
      normal subjects had antibodies against thoracic proteins of this species (almost 
      50% of all the sera having high titres of such antibodies). Antibodies to An.
      vagus were detected, although almost always at very low titres, in 84% of the
      microfilaraemic subjects and 42% of the endemic normal. Thus, the seroprevalence 
      of antibodies to thoracic antigens from a mosquito species bore no relationship
      with the indoor-resting densities of that species.

AB  - Malaria in industrial complexes is promoted by extensive mosquitogenic potential 
      generated by excavations and importation of parasite through migratory labor. The
      National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Shaktinagar, Sonbhadra district was
      surveyed for malariogenic conditions from 1994 to 1996. The major mosquito
      breeding sites were drains, storm-water drains, lakes, outside tanks, overhead
      tanks, sluice-valve chambers, ornamental tanks, wells, pit wells and water
      reservoirs, etc. Anopheles culicifacies was the major vector of malaria in this
      area. Sibling species identification of An. culicifacies revealed that species C 
      predominated during the transmission season and responsible to transmit malaria. 
      Insecticide susceptibility tests against An. culicifacies sl showed that
      An.culicifacies population was 100% susceptible to malathion, fenitrothorn and
      deltamethrin while it was found 44% resistant to DDT. The malaria cases recorded 
      in 1994, 1995 and 1996 were 847, 590 and 409 respectively. In vitro study on P.
      falciparum cases showed that 41, 70, 50% of the isolates tested were resistant to
      chloroquine in 1994, 1995 and 1996 respectively while an in vivo follow-up study 
      showed 20-30% P. falciparum cases resistant to chloroquine. An integrated
      approach involving alternate vector control measures along with judicious use of 
      insecticides has been suggested to bring down malaria in industrial complexes.

TI  - Impact of single round of indoor residual spray with lambda-cyhalotrin 10% WP on 
      Plasmodium falciparum infection in Akola district, Maharashtra State.
PG  - 190-200
AB  - Lambda-cyhalothrin 10% WP (ICON 10WP) was sprayed from 5th November 1997 at a
      dose of 25 mg/m2 as indoor residual spray in 74 high risk villages. The spray was
      completed within 10 days in most of the villages. The monthly entomological
      monitoring showed nil density of Anopheles culicifacies and Aedes and very low
      density of non-vector Anopheles and Culex. The impact of Lambda-cyhalothrin spray
      was discernible right in the month of November 1997 showing 52% reduction in P.
      falciparum cases as compared to the same month of preceding year. The reduction
      of P. falciparum cases in three months post-spray period was 77% (from 47 cases
      to 11 cases) as compared to similar months of preceding year and overall
      reduction of total malaria cases was 50% during the same period. Since the major 
      part of transmission of P. vivax infection was over by the time
      Lambda-cyhalothrin spray was taken up, obviously the impact on P. vivax infection
      was not markedly high as compared to P. falciparum infection. Neither cerebral
      malaria cases nor deaths due to malaria were recorded in the sprayed villages.

TI  - Malaria investigation in District Jodhpur, Rajasthan, during the summer season.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - Studies were carried out in District Jodhpur of the Thar region of Rajasthan.
      Epidemiological investigation revealed high slide positivity rate in the canal
      irrigated area (54.5 per cent), sand dunes area (67.54 per cent), stone quarry
      area (26.66 per cent) and in the desert plain area (41.5 per cent). Similarly,
      slide falciparum rates were 7.10, 4.38, 6.66 and 5.6 per cent respectively.
      Entomological studies showed An. stephensi and An. culicifacies as major species 
      and their densities ranged between 2 to 14.58 and 0 to 0.9 pmh respectively.
      Resistance in malaria vectors to insecticides, poor surveillance and suppressive 
      treatment of cases appear to be the factors for persistent transmission in the
      study area.

TI  - Breeding preferences of Anopheles culicifacies in the rice agro-ecosystem in

PG  - 53-60
AB  - Breeding preferences of Anopheles culicifacies, a principle malaria vector, in
      the plains of India was studied in the rice agro-ecosystem of Kheda district in
      central Gujarat. Extensive breeding of this species was found in the rice field
      channels (20.83 per cent) and in rice fields (5.32 per cent). However, rice
      nurseries (0.91 per cent) and post-harvested rice fields (2.51 per cent) were
      less preferred. The species was found in abundance in newly transplanted rice
      fields and during early months of rice cultivation with a peak prevalence in the 
      non-monsoon (Rabi) season. The breeding of An. culicifacies was inversely
      proportional and negatively correlated (r = -0.868; p < 0.05) with the height of 
      the plants, whereas it showed a positive correlation (r = 0.779; p < 0.05) with
      the distance between plants. Rice fields near the villages supported maximum
      breeding of An. culicifacies (48 per cent) followed by the rice fields, 0.5 to
      one km away from the human habitation. Co-efficient of association (C8 index)
      revealed a positive association of the species with An. annularis, An. pallidus, 
      An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. However, it was negatively associated
      with An. nigerrimus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui sub groups.

PG  - 19-32
AB  - Studies on the breeding pattern of mosquito immatures and the successional
      changes in the abundance of aquatic insects were conducted in rice fields near
      Madurai, south India. The population of late (III/IV) larval instars of culicines
      peaked on Day 28 and pupae (Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pseudovishnui and Cx.
      vishnui) peaked on Day 9 after transplantation, whereas the population of late
      (III/IV) larval instars of anophelines peaked on Day 19 and pupae of Anopheles
      subpictus and An. vagus on Days 7 and 9 respectively, after transplantation of
      paddy. A total of 14 families (consisting of 17 subfamilies) of aquatic insects
      belonging to six different orders, Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera,
      Anisoptera and Zygoptera were collected during the study period and the abundance
      of each group of insects is discussed in detail. The Shannon-Weaver Diversity
      Index, applied to study the diversity of different groups of aquatic insects,
      showed a clear pattern in diversity of surface predators, bottom predators and
      non-predators of mosquito immatures. The multiple linear regression model reveals
      that notonectid adults, coenagrionids, libellulids and veliids act as important
      predators of mosquito immatures in rice fields.

TI  - Anopheline ecology and malaria transmission at a new irrigation project area
      (Bargi Dam) in Jabalpur (Central India).
PG  - 279-87
AB  - Anopheline ecology and malaria transmission were studied in a newly irrigated
      area of the Bargi Project, District Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, Central India.
      Observations were made for 2 years (1993-95) in 10 villages along the Bargi
      irrigation canal, which are situated between 44 km (head end of canal) and 78 km 
      (tail end of canal) from the dam site. Anopheles annularis was the predominant
      species in the head-end villages and its abundance was directly related to the
      opening of the canal, whereas Anopheles culicifacies was the most abundant
      species in tail-end villages, where irrigation is limited. Anopheles culicifacies
      showed 2 typical peaks not related to canal irrigation. Site-related differences 
      in species prevalence were significant in both immatures and adults. Malaria
      infection was due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. The annual
      parasite incidence in children and adults was significantly higher in head-end
      villages (>4-fold) as compared to that in tail-end villages. However, seasonal
      trends in the prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax were the same in each
      group, with some fluctuations. In this study, preliminary results of the
      investigation are presented, demonstrating the trends in anopheline ecology and
      parasite prevalence in relation to the dynamics of irrigation development.

PG  - 95-9
AB  - Attempts have been made to identify the source of blood meals of twenty three
      anopheline species from various areas of high malaria endemicity in India.
      Anopheles minimus, Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles dirus showed a high
      propensity for human blood in North-Eastern parts of the country while Anopheles 
      sundicus was found to be anthropophilic in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Anopheles
      culicifacies, Anopheles maculatus and Anopheles philippinensis were found
      primarily zoophilic in north-eastern areas. High anthropophily has been closely
      related to sporozoite infection in anophelines specially in Anopheles minimus and
      is of great epidemiological significance.

      members of the complex were found to support complete sporogony with varying
      success. Controls, A. stephensi, become readily infected, with >70% developing
      oocysts. Of the test groups, species A had the highest percentage of mosquitoes
      with oocysts (>25%) and sporozoites (>15%). Anopheles culicifacies species B were
      least susceptible; less than 10% had oocysts and sporozoites in the salivary
      glands. The results demonstrate that A. culicifacies species A is most
      susceptible and species B is least susceptible to infections with both the
      parasites.

AB  - Species-specific differences in the nucleotide sequences of the second internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were used to develop
      a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for two of the sibling species
      of the Anopheles fluviatilis complex, members of which are major vectors of
      malaria in central and northern parts of India. This assay consisted of a three
      primer reaction, which could amplify the DNA of both the species producing
      fragments of two distinct sizes, 350 bp for species X and 450 bp for species Y,
      respectively. The assay was found to be highly specific and sensitive.

TI  - Disappearance of malaria vector Anopheles sundaicus from Chilika Lake area of
      Orissa State in India.
PG  - 445-9
AB  - Malaria has declined around Chilika Lake (85 degrees 20'E, 19 degrees 40'N) in
      Orissa State, India, from hyperendemicity in the 1930s to hypoendemicity during
      recent decades. Six decades ago, 21 spp. of Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera:
      Culicidae) were recorded from this area, including the well known Indian malaria 
      vectors An. culicifacies Giles, An. fluviatilis James, An. maculatus Theobald,
      An. stephensi Liston and An. sundaicus (Rodenwaldt), the last formerly regarded
      as the main vector locally. Surveys of Chilika area during 1995-96 found 8 spp.
      of culicine plus 14 spp. of anopheline mosquitoes, the latter comprising An.
      subpictus Grassi sensu lato, An. hyrcanus (Pallas) s.l., An. vagus Donitz, An.
      annularis van der Wulp s.l., An. culicifacies Giles s.l., An. aconitus Donitz,
      An. varuna Iyengar, An. barbirostris van der Wulp s.l., An. philippinensis
      Ludlow, An. ramsayi Covell, An. jeyporiensis James, An. pallidus Theobald, An.
      tessellatus Theobald and An. karwari James in decreasing order of abundance.
      Among indoor-resting female mosquitoes, the anthropophilic index was 4-7% and
      some species (An. culicifacies, An. subpictus, An. vagus) tended to enter houses 
      for resting after blood-feeding outside. Females of potentially infective age
      (three-parous) were obtained for An. culicifacies (11%) and An. annularis (<2%), 
      the more abundant established vector in this coastal area, but not for small
      samples of An. subpictus and An. vagus. Anophelines reported previously but not
      found in our survey were An. fluviatilis, An. jamesii Theobald, A. maculatus, An.
      splendidus Koidzumi, An. stephensi, An. theobaldi Giles and the former main
      vector An. sundaicus.

TI  - Anopheles culicifacies Y-chromosome dimorphism indicates sibling species (B and
      E) with different malaria vector potential in Sri Lanka.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - In Sri Lanka, malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles culicifacies Giles sensu
      lato (Diptera: Culicidae). In India, this nominal taxon comprises sibling species
      A, B, C, D and E, distinguished by their chromosome morphology. Species B
      (identified by polytene chromosome sequence Xab, 2g1 + h1) is not such an
      efficient vector of malaria as other members of the An. culicifacies complex in
      India. All specimens of An. culicifacies s.l. examined from Sri Lanka possess
      Xab, 2g1 + h1 polytenes, previously interpreted as species B, despite their
      important vector status. Recently, species E was described from Rameshwaram
      Island (Tamil Nadu, India) between Sri Lanka and the Indian mainland, where both 
      species B and E are sympatric. Species B and E share polytene sequence Xab, 2g1 +
      h1 but differ by the mitotic Y-chromosome being acrocentric in species B,
      submetacentric in species E, the latter implicated as vector of vivax malaria.
      From May 1999 to January 2000, we surveyed Y-chromosomes of male progeny from An.
      culicifacies Xab, 2g1 + h1 females collected from cattle bait in diverse
      malarious districts of Sri Lanka: Badulla, Monaragala, Puttalam and Trincomalee. 
      Karyotypes of readable quality were obtained from 42/83 families examined, with
      overall proportions 24% acrocentric and 76% submetacentric Y-chromosome carriers,
      both types being sympatric in at least 3/4 localities sampled. By analogy with
      the situation on Rameshwaram Island, we interpret these observations to
      demonstrate widespread presence of two members of the An. culicifacies complex in
      Sri Lanka, their karyotypes being compatible with species B and E, the latter
      predominant and having greater vector potential.

TI  - Susceptibility of ten species of mosquito larvae to the parasitic nematode
      Romanomermis iyengari and its development.
PG  - 426-9
AB  - Ten species of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) from five genera were exposed to
      preparasites of the tropical mermithid nematode species Romanomermis iyengari
      (Welch) (Nematoda: Mermithidae), a strain isolated in 1978 from Pondicherry. By
      exposing mosquito larvae during the second instar, nematode infection was
      invariably lethal, the rate being highest in Culex sitiens Wiedemann (95%)
      followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus Say (90%), Aedes aegypti (L.) (79%), Anopheles
      subpictus Grassi (64%), Ae. albopictus (Skuse) and Armigeres subalbatus
      Coquillett (62%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (57%), Mansonia annulifera
      (Theobald) (46%), An. stephensi Liston (40%) and An. culicifacies Giles (36%).
      When fourth-instar larvae were exposed, the infection was highest in Ar.
      subalbatus (66%), followed by An. stephensi (52%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (47%),
      Ae. aegypti and An. subpictus (42%), Ae. albopictus (30%), An. culicifacies
      (29%), Cx. sitiens (24%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (19%) and Ma. annulifera (8%),
      with 2-45% of infected culicines surviving to adulthood. The parasitic phase of
      the nematode lasted 5-7 days in all the host species, yielding 1.1-3.2 parasites 
      per II instar and 1.1-2.5 parasites per IV instar. The overall output of
      parasites per 100 mosquito larvae (infected + uninfected) was highest for Ae.
      aegypti when mosquitoes were exposed during II instar (2.53 parasites/larva) and 
      for Ar. subalbatus when mosquitoes were exposed during IV instar (1.65/larva),
      and lowest for Ma. annulifera exposed during IV instar (0.09/larva). For routine 
      laboratory culture of R. iyengari it is convenient to employ Cx. quinquefasciatus
      as the host yielding 90-190 parasites/100 larva.

TI  - Effects of organic and inorganic fertilisers on mosquito populations in rice
      fields of southern India.
PG  - 361-8
AB  - The effects of nitrogenous (inorganic) fertilisers, organic manures and
      blue-green algae (BGA) biofertiliser on mosquito populations (Diptera: Culicidae)
      were studied in rice fields of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, south India, with particular 
      attention to Culex vishnui Theobald, Cx. pseudovishnui Colless and Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus Giles, the vectors of Japanese encephalitis (JE). The
      application of urea, a nitrogenous fertiliser, in rice fields significantly
      increased the grain yield and the population densities of mosquito larvae and
      pupae (anophelines as well as culicines) in a dose-related manner. Fields treated
      with inorganic fertilisers (N, P, K) had significantly higher population
      densities of mosquito immatures than fields treated with organic manures
      (farmyard manure and green manure). Without nitrogenous fertiliser, BGA increased
      paddy yield without enhancing mosquito production. Therefore, the use of BGA with
      less nitrogenous fertiliser is recommended, which is beneficial economically and 
      agronomically to the farming community and also significantly reduces mosquito
      production in rice fields. Increased use of nitrogenous fertiliser over the past 
      two decades may have contributed to the increased severity of Japanese
      encephalitis epidemics, vectors of which breed in rice fields.

TI  - Malaria outbreak in a tribal area of Gujarat state, India.
PG  - 219-24
AB  - Malaria incidence in Gujarat state had been on a general decline since 1989.
      However in some tribal villages in forested areas of Valsad district, southern
      Gujarat, there was an outbreak of malaria in September 1995. Five children died
      in Ashlona village. During investigation conducted in October 1995 in affected
      villages, the malaria parasite rate was 26% (217/833) with >91% infections due to
      P. falciparum. A high proportion of P. falciparum infections had ring stages
      suggesting active transmission. Against a minimum norm of 10% annual blood
      examination rate, there was a major breakdown of active surveillance for malaria.
      In the absence of health agencies in or near affected villages, the malaria
      parasite load continued to build up leading to an outbreak towards the end of
      monsoon season. Indoor residual spraying with deltamethrin caused significant
      reduction in densities of malaria vector An. culicifacies. Measures to prevent
      malaria outbreaks in inaccessible areas have been discussed.

TI  - Sequence analysis of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragment from seven
      mosquito species.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - Mosquitoes are vectors for the transmission of many human pathogens that include 
      viruses, nematodes and protozoa. For the understanding of their vectorial
      capacity, identification of disease carrying and refractory strains is essential.
      Recently, molecular taxonomic techniques have been utilized for this purpose.
      Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene has been used for molecular 
      taxonomy in many insects. In this paper, we have analysed a 450 bp hypervariable 
      region of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene in three major genera of mosquitoes,
      Aedes, Anopheles and Culex. The sequence was found to be unusually A+T rich and
      in substitutions the rate of transversions was higher than the transition rate. A
      phylogenetic tree was constructed with these sequences. An interesting feature of
      the sequences was a stretch of Ts that distinguished between Ae-des and Culex on 
      the one hand, and Anopheles on the other. This is the first report of
      mitochondrial rRNA sequences from these medically important genera of mosquitoes.

AB  - Trichophyton ajelloi, a fungus isolated from soil, caused high larval mortality
      in Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus in the laboratory. The efficacy
      and toxicity of T. ajelloi against An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus were
      evaluated at 6 different concentrations. At different concentrations of T.
      ajelloi, chitin synthesis in larval cuticle was adversely affected. Larvae of
      3rd-stage An. stephensi were more susceptible to T. ajelloi than were larvae of
      1st, 2nd, and 4th stages as calculated by probit analysis. Larvae of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus were relatively resistant to infection by T. ajelloi.

TI  - Studies on Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles culicifacies sibling species in
      relation to malaria in forested hilly and deforested riverine ecosystems in
      northern Orissa, India.
PG  - 199-205
AB  - In a malaria-endemic region in northwestern Orissa, India, a longitudinal study
      was undertaken to delineate information on the sibling species of Anopheles
      fluviatilis and Anopheles culicifacies and their bionomics and role in malaria
      transmission in forested and deforested ecosystems. In forested villages, An.
      fluviatilis sibling species S (97.97%) and T (2.02%) were present. The former was
      highly anthropophagic (human blood index 0.88). Among the sibling species of An. 
      culicifacies, species B (27.96%), C (71.1%), and B/C heterozygotes (0.94%) were
      present and were highly zoophagic. In deforested riverine villages An.
      fluviatilis was nearly absent and An. culicifacies sibling species A (0.48%), B
      (21.1%), C (77.94%), and B/C heterozygotes (0.48%) were present. In forested
      villages, the annual parasite incidence (269 cases/1,000) and the slide
      positivity rate (45%) were significantly higher than those in deforested areas,
      which had values of 39 cases/1,000 and 27%, respectively. The study showed that
      the high endemicity of malaria in the forested villages was due primarily to 2
      vectors, the high rate of anthropophagy of An. fluviatilis species S, and also
      the more favorable ecological conditions for this vector.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria outbreak (April/May, 1999) in Titabor Primary Health
      Centre, district Jorhat (Assam).
PG  - 121-6
AB  - An investigation was undertaken of a malaria outbreak in the Primary Health
      Centre Titabor, district Jorhat, Assam during May/June 1999. The fever rate in
      the community since March 1999, was 44.4 per cent with an average case load of
      2.5 per family. The fever cases peaked in the third week of May. Slide positive
      and slide falciparum rates in mass blood survey, in the study village were 16.1
      and 14.5 per cent respectively with 90 per cent infection of Plasmodium
      falciparum. Males (SPR 17.5%) suffered relatively more than females (SPR 14.7%). 
      Malaria prevalence was significantly less in individuals above 15 yr of age (SPR 
      11.0%) as compared to those below 15 yr (SPR 22.9%). Prevalence of malaria as
      well as mosquito densities in different clusters of the village were inversely
      related to the distance from the forested Naga hills. Anopheles minimus and A.
      dirus were collected in good numbers with comparatively higher densities of the
      former. Several factors like unusual climatic conditions, inadequate
      surveillance, unsatisfactory laboratory services and inadequate indoor residual
      insecticide spray were instrumental for the outbreak.

TI  - Cytotaxonomic evidence for the presence of Anopheles nivipes in India.
PG  - 71-4
AB  - Anopheles philippinensis mosquitoes were collected from 5 states in India: Assam,
      Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. Half-gravid females were
      examined for variations in wing venation using the presector dark mark on vein I 
      and polytene chromosomes derived from ovarian nurse cells. Polytene chromosomes
      were examined for diagnostic inversions, t on chromosome arm 2 and I on arm 5.
      Based on wing characteristics, both An. philippinensis and An. nivipes were
      identified. Polytene chromosome examinations revealed that all specimens from
      these 2 populations had 2t; 51 inversion genotype, a diagnostic character for An.
      nivipes. The wing character was not diagnostic; therefore, it was concluded that 
      all the specimens examined were actually An. nivipes and not An. philippinensis. 
      Further, the X chromosome was of x+b type, that is, the standard arrangement with
      reference to the inversion b, reported in the An. nivipes population in Thailand.
      This is the 1st report that unequivocally establishes the occurrence of An.
      nivipes in India and also shows that the adult wing character is not reliable in 
      distinguishing An. philippinensis from An. nivipes, as has been observed in
      Thailand.

TI  - Evaluation of cyfluthrin and fenfluthrin for their insecticidal activity against 
      three vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - The EC50/EC90 concentrations of cyfluthrin and fenfluthrin were tested for their 
      activity against different developmental stages of three important vector
      mosquitoes viz., Anopheles stephensi Liston, Aedes aegypti (Linn.) and Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say. The EC90 concentrations of both cyfluthrin and fenfluthrin 
      showed ovicidal effect on An. Stephensi and Ae. aegypti whereas EC90 of
      cyfluthrin checked the hatching of eggs completely in Cx. quinquefasciatus.
      Fenfluthrin at EC50 concentration reduced the percentage of hatching
      significantly (p < 0.05) only in An. stephensi. Both the compounds were more
      active against the fourth larval instars of all mosquito species and cyfluthrin
      in culicines (17.3% Ae. aegypti = 9.1%) and fenfluthrin in anophenlines (An.
      stephensi = 36.8%) brought about maximum inhibition in adult emergence. Various
      types/degrees of morphogenetic aberrations were induced in all mosquito species
      on treatment with these compounds. Cyfluthrin treated female mosquitoes showed
      reduced fecundity rates in An. stephensi (p < 0.05), Cx. quinquefasciatus (p <
      0.001) and fenfluthrin treated in An. stephensi (p < 0.5) and Ae. aegypti (p <
      0.05). The fertility rates of all the mosquito species were significantly reduced
      (p < 0.001) by both the compounds.

TI  - Some aspects of changing behaviour of malaria vectors in tribal areas of India.
PG  - 267-78
AB  - The field entomological studies and surveys carried out in 72 tribal districts
      out of 100 in seven penninsular States namely, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat,
      Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan indicated that in most of the
      areas the vector mosquitoes encountered during the present study were almost the 
      same as recorded by the earlier workers except that Anopheles fluviatilis James, 
      1902 was recorded in the areas of district Raipur, Durg, Bilaspur, Raigarh,
      Shahdol, Rajnandgaon, Barwani and Janjgir of Madhya Pradesh, and Sundergarh of
      Orissa during the present survey. This vector was not recorded in earlier studies
      by other workers. An. culicifacies Giles, 1901 was not found in present survey in
      East Godavari and Vishakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh and Ganjam and Koraput of
      Orissa where this mosquito was found in collections earlier. Similarly, An.
      fluviatilis was not encountered during the present field study in Bhilwara of
      Rajasthan, Phulbani and Kalahandi of Orissa, Thane, Nanded and Nasik of
      Maharashtra and Bharuch of Gujarat state. During this study An. fluviatilis was
      noted to be mostly endophilic whereas earlier workers noted this mosquito to be
      exophilic in a large number of districts. The majority of the tribal districts
      seem to be under the influence of two malaria vectors, An. culicifacies and An.
      fluviatilis and these tribal districts are maintaining a high malaria endemicity 
      with predominance of Plasmodium falciparum infection. In the present study, the
      transmission seasons were noted to be longer than recorded earlier in the
      districts of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Orissa. In the remaining
      states it is almost similar as recorded earlier.

AB  - DNA-binding proteins present in fourth instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi were 
      isolated by affinity chromatography on native and denatured DNA cellulose columns
      and analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. A denatured DNA-specific 
      protein with an approximate molecular weight of 30 kDa was the predominant DNA
      binding protein of larvae. This protein was purified to electrophoretic
      homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by phosphocellulose
      chromatography. The purified 30 kDa binding protein showed an endonucleolytic
      activity capable of converting pBR 322 supercoiled DNA to the circular form.
      Maximum endonucleolytic activity was observed in the presence of 5 mM Mg(2+) at
      pH 7.4. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by EDTA.

TI  - Effect of entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana on larvae of three species 
      of mosquitoes.
PG  - 1148-50
AB  - Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus, was evaluated for its potential
      against second and third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles
      stephensi and Aedes aegypti. Conidiospores of this fungus were effective in
      causing infection leading to mortality of different larval instars. Larvae of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus were more susceptible to infection than An. stephensi and the
      second instar larvae of these two species were more susceptible than third instar
      larvae. Larvae of Ae. aegypti were resistant to infection by B. bassiana.

AB  - A total of 31 species of mosquitoes belonging to 10 genera, i.e. Anopheles,
      Aedes, Armigeres, Culex, Harpagomyia, Hodgesia, Mansonia, Orthopodomyia,
      Toxorhynchites and Uranotaenia were collected from Car Nicobar Island. Four
      Anopheles species, An. barbumbrosus, An. insulaeflorum, An. kochi and An. roperi 
      were recorded for the first time from this Island. An. sundaicus was the most
      predominant species encountered. The results of the study on anophelines with
      emphasis on species-specific breeding preference in various aquatic habitats have
      been recorded.

TI  - Impact of Spherix (Bacillus sphaericus B-101, serotype H5a, 5b) spraying on the
      control of mosquito breeding in rural areas of Farrukhabad District, Uttar
      Pradesh.
PG  - 185-96
AB  - Spray impact of Spherix (Bacillus sphaericus B-101, Serotype H5a, 5b) was
      assessed against larval and adult populations of mosquito species in rural areas 
      of Farrukhabad district, Uttar Pradesh. High mortality (> 95%) was observed
      against anopheline and culicine larvae within 48 h of spray @ 1 g/sq m. But the
      biolarvicidal effect declined within a week which indicated nonrecycling capacity
      and weekly reapplications were required. The encouraging results obtained through
      weekly sprays were short-lived because of decline in efficacy in some perennial
      intradomestic Culex breedings after 15 rounds of spray. The two year intensive
      field trials, however, had no appreciable impact on adult densities of both
      malaria vector An. culicifacies and bancroftian filariasis vector Culex
      quinquefasciatus. Environmental disturbances and manmade problems also affected
      the efficacy of the biolarvicide.

TI  - Variations in the response to Bacillus sphaericus toxins in different strains of 
      Anopheles stephensi Liston.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - Bacillus sphaericus has a potential of use as a larvicide in water storage
      practices but no such study has been done against Anopheles stephensi. Baseline
      susceptibility status of eleven wild and three mutant strains of An. stephensi to
      Spherix, a formulation of B. sphaericus, strain B-101 (serotype H5a, 5b) was
      determined to find the variations in the degree of their response to B.
      sphaericus toxins and to study the possibility of development of resistance. The 
      LC50 and LC90 values of different strains of An. stephensi to B. sphaericus
      formulation varied from 0.088 to 1.42 mg/l and 0.314 to 10.98 mg/l, respectively.
      Among all the strains tested, Sarojini Nagar, Delhi strain of An. stephensi (a
      wild type strain) was least susceptible. Laboratory selection of Sarojini Nagar
      strain of An. stephensi with B. sphaericus at a concentration of 4 mg/l resulted 
      in the development of a high degree of resistance (LC50 > 1600 mg/l) to B.
      sphaericus within four generations.

PG  - 573-7
AB  - Three colonized species of the Anopheles culicifacies complex (species A, B and
      C) were compared with Anopheles stephensi (control) for susceptibility to
      Plasmodium vivax. In feeding experiments involving over 400 paired comparisons,
      the mean number of oocysts, oocyst rate and sporozoite rate were found to be
      significantly different. Of the test groups, species A had the highest percentage
      of mosquitoes with oocysts (> 60%) and sporozoites (> 50%). An. culicifacies
      species B were least susceptible, less than 5% had oocysts and less than 2% had
      sporozoites in the salivary glands. The results are discussed in the light of the
      vectorial potential of the members of the An. culicifacies complex observed in
      field studies.

PG  - 243-6
AB  - The efficacy of aqueous suspension (AS) and granular (G) formulation of Bacillus 
      thuringiensis var. israelensis (Vectobac) was tested against the immatures of
      mosquito vectors in the laboratory and under field conditions. Laboratory tests
      showed that the aqueous suspension was relatively more effective against Culex
      quinquefasciatus than Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi, the respective
      LC(50) values being 0.046, 0.060 and 0.190 mg/l. In stream pools, with the
      application of Vectobac AS at 1.2 l/ha, more than 80% reduction in immature
      density of Anopheles larvae (Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles culicifacies)
      was observed for 2-8 days, and at 2.4 l/ha for 3.5-9.0 days. At the dosage of 7.0
      kg/ha of the granular formulation, a reduction in immature density by more than
      80% was observed for 2-9 days. In polluted habitats such as cesspits, U-drains
      and cement tanks, the effectiveness of Vectobac AS lasted for 1-4 days when
      applied at 1.2 and 2.4 l/ha, and Vectobac G was effective for 1-3 days at
      application rates of 7. 0 and 14.0 kg/ha against C. quinquefasciatus. There was
      no significant difference in the effectiveness between the two formulations and
      the two application rates.

TI  - Current scenario of malaria in India.
PG  - 349-53
AB  - The Indian National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP) is reporting 2.5 to 3
      million malaria cases, and about 1,000 malaria deaths annually. Malaria in the
      northeastern states is stable and in the peninsular India unstable. There are six
      major and three minor malaria vectors, of which Anopheles culicifacies transmits 
      malaria in rural areas and An. stephensi in the towns. Other vectors are of local
      importance. Plasmodium vivax is the dominant infection and accounts for 60-65%
      cases whereas P. falciparum contributes 30-35% cases. Field operations to control
      malaria are impeded by resistance and/or exophilic vector behavior, parasite
      resistance to antimalarial drugs, operational problems in spraying, failure to
      search breeding of mosquitoes at weekly intervals, staff shortages and financial 
      constraints. Resurgent malaria invaded new ecotypes created by green revolution, 
      industrial growth and urban development resulting in paradigm shift towards
      man-made malaria. NMEP has launched a world bank-assisted enhanced malaria
      control project with primary emphasis to protect 62.2 million high risk
      population in 7 states.

PG  - 49-52
AB  - This essay examines briefly Ronald Ross's research on malaria in India between
      1895 and 1899, during which time he elucidated the role of the Anopheles mosquito
      in the transmission of the disease. During his crucial experimental work in 1898,
      he used birds, human malaria being relatively uncommon in Calcutta. This article 
      is based largely on the correspondence between Ross and Patrick Manson, which has
      just been edited.

AB  - Sublethal effect of hexaflumuron, an insect growth regulator (IGR), on the
      oviposition of three species of vector mosquitos. Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes
      aegypti and Anopheles stephensi was studied. Significant reduction in oviposition
      was observed in the females of the above three species derived from fourth instar
      larvae and pupae exposed to sublethal (EI5 and EI50) doses. The reduction in egg 
      laying is proportional to the dose of exposure and was found to be about twice
      higher in females of three species exposed to EI50 dose than those exposed to EI5
      dose. Among the three species exposed at larval and pupal stages, Ae. aegypti
      showed maximum reduction in egg laying (29.3-46.6%). Blood feeding was also
      reduced in females exposed to EI50 dose at larval stage and a positive
      correlation was demonstrated between the quantity of blood meal taken and the
      proportion of eggs laid. Significant reduction in the quantum of blood ingested
      by the treated females may be responsible for the reduced egg laying.

TI  - Malaria and the Narmada-river development in India: a case study of the Bargi
      dam.
PG  - 477-88
AB  - The largest river-valley development to be proposed in India is that in the
      Narmada valley. The building of the Bargi dam, a multi-purpose irrigation and
      hydro-electric project, in Jabalpur, in central India, formed part of the first
      phase of the development of this valley (1974-1988). Many villages and several
      hectares of land in three districts were submerged as the waters rose behind the 
      dam, the worst affected area being the catchment area of the primary health
      centre (PHC) at Narayanganj, in Mandla district. Until recently, cases of malaria
      were relatively rare in Narayanganj. However, an epidemic of malaria in late 1996
      claimed hundreds of lives in the area and the outbreak spread, during 1997, to
      new villages in the region. A review of the records collected by the National
      Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP) not only indicated that the slide positivity
      rate (SPR) for Narayanganj increased > 7.45-fold between 1979 and 1997 but also
      that the slide falciparum rate (SFR) increased > 32-fold over the same period.
      The NMEP data available for Mandla district as a whole indicated a doubling in
      mean SPR and SFR between 1979 and 1997. There is no evidence that a new species
      of vector has established since 1979. In fact, indoor-resting densities of
      anophelines and of the most established vector, Anopheles culicifacies, have
      fallen since the dam was built, but densities of another vector, An. fluviatilis,
      have increased.

      Anopheles stephensi (Diptera:Culicidae).
PG  - 214-6
AB  - Parasitism by Plasmodium yoelii yoelii induced 18 polypeptides in the salivary
      glands of aging malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. A polypeptide of low
      molecular size (30 kDa) could generally be induced at all infected stages. On day
      5 post blood feeding (PBF), no new polypeptide could be found in the salivary
      glands. Seven polypeptides of low molecular size and 3 of high molecular size
      could be induced on day 11 PBF, which inducibility coincided with the invasion of
      the salivary glands by the sporozoites. Quantitatively, soluble proteins
      decreased in the salivary glands by about one-third in females that had consumed 
      infected or uninfected blood meal on day 9 (oocysts stage) as compared to
      nonfeeding females. However, on day 15, in the salivary glands invaded by
      sporozoites, the amount of proteins obtained from infected females was
      approximately 26% lower than that obtained from uninfected females. A similar
      reduction was also observed in aged (20 days PBF) salivary glands of infected
      mosquitoes. These proteins could confer parasite tolerance to the females and
      enhance parasite transmission potential.

      Ambala districts of Haryana State, India. The vector population showed a high
      degree of resistance to DDT and dieldrin. The test mortality to DDT and dieldrin 
      ranged from 25% to 28% and 18% to 20%, respectively, in Nadasahib of Ambala
      districts. The mortality of An. culicifacies to malathion ranged between 65% and 
      68%. All the tests with lambda-cyhalothrin resulted in 100% mortality of An.
      culicifacies. DDT and dieldrin resistance did not confer cross-resistance to
      lambda-cyhalothrin in An. culicifacies.

AB  - The pattern of synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSP) and thermotolerance to
      elevated temperatures during the development of the malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi normally reared at 28 +/- 2 degrees C was studied using SDS-PAGE. In
      total twelve heat shock proteins (i.e. 31, 33, 38, 43, 44, 51, 57, 62, 69, 71,
      113 and 121 kD were induced by heat shock during various stages of development.
      Eight polypeptides (HSP during one or other of the instars) appeared during
      normal development of the adult, which showed very little response towards heat
      shock. Only two polypeptides (57 and 69 kD) were induced while the 22.5 kD
      protein disappeared during adult life. The HSP 62 and 71 kD induced during the
      larval stages showed a sharp decline in quantity in male and female adults upon
      heat shock. Three HSP (31, 43 and 44 kD) were induced in pupae due to heat shock.
      The synthesis of HSP in A. stephensi was correlated with the various
      morphological and physiological events occurring during development.

PG  - 595-600
AB  - Female Anopheles culicifacies Giles from Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu
      state, India, were examined for oocysts and sporozoites and their larval progeny 
      for mitotic karyotype. Collections were made from Mandapam and Uchipuli on the
      mainland, and Thangachimadam and Pamban on Rameshwaram Island. Of the 451 An.
      culicifacies females that were collected and dissected, 24 were found positive
      for Plasmodia (21 for sporozoites and 3 for oocysts). Both acrocentric and
      submetacentric Y-chromosome karyotypes were observed among the progeny of females
      from all villages. All 11 iso-female lines whose parental females were positive
      for sporozoites or oocysts had progeny with submetacentric Y-chromosomes. Total
      absence of sporozoite-positives among mothers of acrocentric males was evidence
      of assortative mating between these 2 sympatric populations (i.e., 2 species). We
      propose that the nonvector population with acrocentric Y-chromosome sons retain
      the original designation of species B and that the vector population with the
      submetacentric Y-chromosome sons be designated as species E, a new species.

AB  - In an entomological study in South Tripura district of Tripura state during June 
      1998, a total of 31 species of mosquitoes belonging to eight genera were
      recorded. Among the known malaria vectors in India, Anopheles annularis, An.
      jeyporiensis, An. minimus, An. philippinensis/nivipes and An. varuna were
      collected but none of them could be incriminated. During the survey, Aedes
      pallidostriatus and Malaya genurostris were recorded for the first time in the
      north-eastern region and Tripura state respectively. Presence of host seeking An.
      minimus in light-trap collections indoors and its absence during morning indoor
      resting collections indicated the probability of some degree of exophilic
      behaviour of An. minimus population in Tripura.

PG  - 131-45
AB  - Ninety-one mosquito species in 15 genera were collected from 22 habitat types of 
      Upper Brahmaputra valley in Assam and bordering areas of Arunachal Pradesh.
      Nineteen species have been recorded for the first time in Assam including seven
      first records from the northeast region and three first country records.
      Jaccard's coefficient was used to quantify the similarity between 13 different
      geographical localities surveyed on the basis of their mosquito fauna. Group
      average sorting (UPGMA) cluster analysis was used to find out relationship
      between Jonai, Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and north Lakhimpur (study zones) on 
      the basis of their mosquito community. Immatures of three malaria vectors
      incriminated from the northeast India, viz. Anopheles dirus, An. minimus and An. 
      philippinensis were collected exclusively from forest areas. Fourteen potential
      vectors of Japanese encephalitis incriminated from elsewhere in India were
      collected during the study.

PG  - 77-80
AB  - During a short survey of soil and mosquito breeding sites in Lucknow, India for
      potential mycopathogen from a period of August-October 1996, 11 species of fungi 
      in 5 genera were isolated using live mosquito larvae as host, Aspergillus flavus,
      A. fumigatus and Fusarium semitectum were the most frequently isolated species.
      Other fungi recorded were A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. terreus, A. versicolor,
      Geotrichum candidum, Penicillium verrucosum, Paecilomyces sp. and Fusarium sp.
      (Liseola/Elegans complex). Insect cell walls are known to contain chitin, so
      fungal isolates were tested for their chitinase activity on semi synthetic medium
      containing colloidal chitin. High chitinolytic activities were observed with A.
      flavus and A. ochraceus. Chitinase producers can be considered as potential
      pathogens. However, the higher incidence of F. semitectum could not be explained 
      by inability to utilize chitin.

TI  - Population dynamics of Anopheles culicifacies and malaria in the tribal area of
      central India.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - A longitudinal study (1993-94) on malaria was conducted in Dungaria, a typical
      forest fringe tribal village in Mandla district of central India (Madhya
      Pradesh). Our initial objective was to obtain in-depth baseline data on malaria
      transmission in the tribal village to elucidate the factors responsible for
      persistent malaria in the area and thereby to help in formulating an improved
      malaria control program. Anopheles culicifacies Giles was the predominant vector 
      of malaria, although Anopheles fluviatilis James were recorded in small numbers. 
      The transmission season was from May to November. Analysis of the malaria cases
      revealed hyperendemic malaria, with Plasmodium falciparum the predominant
      species. The prevalence of Plasmodium vivax was mainly in the summer and that of 
      P. falciparum in autumn. The study suggested that a number of factors were
      responsible for the continuation of malaria transmission in the village.

TI  - Species diversity and interspecific associations among mosquitoes in rice
      agro-ecosystem of Kheda district, Gujarat.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - Rice agro-ecosystem of Kheda district in Central Gujarat was inhabited by 14
      species of anophelines and 15 species of culicines. Anopheles subpictus and Culex
      vishnui gr dominated the respective groups. Species diversity in rice fields as
      well as in associated habitats remained high during non-monsoon (rabi) period.
      There existed several positive and negative interspecific associations. Malaria
      vector An. culicifacies showed positive association with An. subpictus, An.
      annularis, An. pallidus and Cx. quinquefasciatus but was found negatively
      associated with An. nigerrimus, Cx. vishnui and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.

PG  - 8-14
AB  - A study on the occurrence and seasonal prevalence of Anopheles stephensi
      (principal vector of malaria in Calcutta) larvae in an urban garden in central
      Calcutta revealed their presence in collections of fresh and/or rain water in
      various kinds of temporary and permanent breeding habitats. Breeding sites in
      shady areas were preferred in comparison to those receiving direct sunlight. The 
      density of An. stephensi larvae was highest in earthen and lowest in wooden pots 
      throughout the study period, as supported by ANOVA and Wilcoxon's signed rank
      test. During monsoons the larval density was uniformly high in all four, i.e.
      earthen, stone, cement and wooden kinds of pots. The variation in the density of 
      An. stephensi larvae due to the effect of season and nature of pots was highly
      significant. Co-existence of An. stephensi larvae with Aedes aegypti, Ae.
      albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus was also observed at times in certain water
      collections. An. stephensi population in the urban garden in central Calcutta was
      found to comprise of two forms the type and variety mysorensis.

TI  - Susceptibility status of malaria vectors to insecticides in India.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - The use of chemical insecticides for control of malaria vector populations
      continues to be the mainstay of malaria control strategy in India. Monitoring
      vector susceptibility to chemical insecticides is an important activity under the
      National Malaria Eradication Programme to ensure judicious and effective use of
      chemical Insecticides. 72 entomological zones were established under NMEP in 1977
      for undertaking entomological studies in the malaria problematic areas. These
      zones have been generating insecticide susceptibility data in respect of the
      various malaria vectors. In this paper the insecticide susceptibility data, in
      respect of major vectors of malaria as on 1997, is presented.

TI  - Field trials of biolarvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis strain 164
      and the larvivorous fish Aplocheilus blocki against Anopheles stephensi for
      malaria control in Goa, India.
PG  - 457-62
AB  - Severe outbreaks of malaria occurred in the coastal villages of the Candolim
      Primary Health Centre (PHC) of Goa, India, in 1993 and 1994. These outbreaks were
      associated with accelerated construction activity with an influx of migrant
      laborers. The weekly application of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis
      (B.t.i.) strain 164 at 1 g/m2 and introduction of the indigenous larvivorous fish
      Aplocheilus blocki in major breeding habitats of Anopheles stephensi replaced
      ongoing DDT spraying and pyrethrum fogging in June 1994. The objective of this
      study was to evaluate the effects of B.t.i. and larvivorous fish on An. stephensi
      and subsequent transmission of malaria in the Candolim PHC, Goa, India. In 1995
      the populations of an. stephensi in larger habitats (habitats with immatures: t =
      5.19, P = 0.0017; immature density: t = 3.57, P = 0.007) and smaller habitats
      (habitats with immature: t = 3.86, P = 0.005; immature density: t = 4.93, P =
      0.002) and malaria incidence declined substantially (malaria cases: chi 2 = 712, 
      P < 0.001; slide positivity rate: chi 2 = 10.36, P < 0.001; annual parasite
      index; chi 2 = 15.1, P < 0.001), whereas the incidence of malaria continued to
      increase in other nearby towns.

TI  - Evaluation of lambdacyhalothrin-impregnated bednets in a malaria endemic area of

PG  - 437-43
AB  - In malaria endemic villages of the Indian State of Orissa, the impact of bednets 
      treated with lambdacyhalothrin at 25 mg/m2 on malaria vectors was assessed during
      a 3-year intervention trial beginning in May 1990. The main malaria vector was
      Anopheles culicifacies with a small contribution from Anopheles fluviatilis. The 
      impregnated bednets caused a significant reduction in vector density as assessed 
      by morning indoor resting catches, man-biting rate, light trapping, the
      proportion of females engorged with human blood, and the parity rate as compared 
      with villages with untreated or no nets. No statistically significant difference 
      was observed in these parameters between the villages with untreated nets or no
      nets. The trial demonstrated that the lambdacyhalothrin-treated nets were highly 
      effective against the malaria vectors.

AB  - In malaria endemic forested villages in Orissa State, India, a 3-year comparison 
      of nylon nets treated with lambdacyhalothrin at 25 mg/m2, untreated nets, and no 
      nets was carried out. Treated nets retained high insecticidal efficacy for more
      than 7 months. Nets washed after 3 months of use gave 98% kill in a bioassay with
      a 3-min exposure. Based on these bioassays during the first year, nets were later
      reimpregnated at 6-monthly intervals with participation of the users. Compliance 
      with the use of nets was good. Eighty-eight percent of nets were usable even
      after 3 years. The main benefits perceived by treated net users were reductions
      in malaria, mosquito bites, head louse infestations, and other nuisance insects. 
      The trial was well accepted by the community. Issues related to social marketing 
      and promotion of nets are discussed.

      conditions. Results revealed that delta-methrin was significantly superior in
      comparison to lambdacyhalothrin and cyfluthrin. Results of bioassay tests
      revealed that deltamethrin was 1.5 and 1.9 times more effective than
      lambdacyhalothrin and cyfluthrin, respectively, against An. stephensi exposed to 
      cotton fabric treated at 100 g/m2. Deltamethrin was 3.9 and 4.6 times more
      effective against Ae. aegypti and 3.53 and 4.0 times more effective against Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. Of cotton, nylon, polyethylene, and jute fabrics, the cotton
      was the best on the basis of median lethal dose (LD50) and 95% lethal dose (LD90)
      values and persistence of insecticide.

TI  - 'Anti-malaria month'--a step forward in multisectoral collaboration and community
      involvement in malaria control.
PG  - 93-101
AB  - For a long time malaria control in India has largely been a government
      responsibility with little involvement of the community at large, and other
      sectors of the economy in the control efforts. There is now increasing
      realisation that involvement of the community and a multi-sectoral approach
      should be essential components of the malaria control strategy. The National
      Malaria Eradication Programme is accordingly laying greater emphasis on
      coordination with other sectors of the economy, and changing community
      perceptions and health-related behaviour. A massive programme of community
      mobilisation with this objective in view has been taken up since 1997. A major
      component of this community mobilisation programme is the observance of an
      'Anti-Malaria Month', during which, country wide awareness campaigns are
      undertaken at all levels of implementation, to promote inter-sectoral
      collaboration and community action for malaria control. The present paper
      summarises the rationale and messages of the 'Anti-Malaria month'.

TI  - A review of Leucosphyrus Group with particular reference to the Anopheles dirus
      complex (Diptera: Culicidae) in India.
PG  - 57-67
AB  - The classification of the Leucosphyrus Group remained confused for long. The
      taxonomic events until it was resolved are traced in this review. The
      significance the description of Anopheles dirus as a new species and the
      subsequent characterization of its siblings are outlined. The current
      classification of the Leucosphyrus Group is presented and the various methods
      available for identifying the members of the dirus Species Complex are
      highlighted. Based on the limited information available about the members of the 
      dirus Complex in India, the need for the reevaluations of this species, behaviour
      and vectorial capacity, which are of considerable importance in relation to
      malaria epidemiology in India, is emphasized.

TI  - Comparative susceptibility of Anopheles subpictus from fresh and brackish water
      areas to Plasmodium falciparum infection.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Anopheles subpictus from fresh and brackish water areas were fed simultaneously, 
      on five volunteers, with Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in their blood. The
      susceptibility to infection was compared. Infections were found in both waters,
      but to different degrees. The mean susceptibility rate among fed mosquitoes was
      6.1% from the fresh water area and 17.4% from the brackish water area. The mean
      number of oocysts in the former was 3.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.2 +/- 4.32 in the latter.
      The mortality rate, up to day 9 post feeding, was 93.8% in fresh water form and
      90.1% in brackish water form. Dissections of wild caught females showed that
      longevity of adults from both areas was shorter, 7-8 days. Despite a considerable
      proportion of mosquitoes being anthropophilic and susceptible to infection, their
      low longevity seems to be the limiting factor in their role in malaria
      transmission in these areas.

AB  - Studies on ecological succession of anophelines and the malaria vectors were
      carried out in rice fields located in two ecologically different terrains, i.e.
      plains and forested hills in Jabalpur district during monsoon (July-October
      1995). Nine and fifteen species of anophelines were found breeding in the rice
      fields of plain and forested hill villages respectively. Anopheles culicifacies
      and An. subpictus were dominant species in both the areas. The percentage
      emergence of adults of An. annularis, An. nigerrimus and An. pallidus was higher 
      in plain villages while the percentage of An. theobaldi, An. fluviatilis and An. 
      jeyporiensis was higher in forested hill villages. Among malaria vectors, three
      species were found breeding in rice fields of hilly terrain, i.e. An.
      culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An. stephensi whereas in rice fields of plains 
      An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were recorded.

TI  - Recent epidemiological status of malaria in Calcutta Municipal Corporation area, 
      West Bengal.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - In Calcutta, Plasmodium falciparum cases and death due to malaria show remarkably
      increasing trend since 1990. The incidence of P. falciparum malaria has increased
      more than eleven folds in 1996 in comparison to 1990, with 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 52 and 
      17 deaths in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 respectively. Situation 
      is more serious than what it is projected in official records as annual blood
      examination rate (ABER) in Calcutta Municipal area is poor, varying from 1.5 to
      3.9 in 1993 and 1996 respectively. This is further evident from the fact that in 
      a study area in 19 months (January 1995 to July 1996) the slide positivity rate
      (SPR) was 47.94% on an average 28.72% suffer from P. falciparum infection (as low
      as 0.5% in June 1996 and as high as 71.5% in November 1996). For the first time
      resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine has been noted at RII and RIII level. 
      The response of the same parasite strain to sulfa-pyrimethamine combination drug 
      is very much promising. Fresh infection is occurring in all the months of the
      year and the favourable period is from July to November 1995 that is
      corroborating with Container index and Breteau index related to the vector
      mosquito Anopheles. Susceptibility status of An. stephensi indicates that the
      mosquito species has acquired resistance to DDT, BHC, propoxure and malathion but
      is still susceptible to fenthion and deltamethrin.

TI  - Extended field trial of deltamethrin WDP for control of malaria at Jagdalpur,

PG  - 173-87
AB  - The synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin 2.5% wdp, was evaluated at a dosage of 25 
      mg/sq m in a group of villages of tribal area around Jagdalpur, District Bastar
      (Madhya Pradesh). Study was carried out in three consecutive years from 1986 to
      1988 with a total of five rounds of deltamethrin spray covering a population of
      approximately 10,000. The suspension of deltamethrin wdp was white in colour,
      odourless, non-irritant and the deposits were faintly visible on the surface of
      wall. A total of 3848 kg of 2.5% deltamethrin wdp was consumed during the trial. 
      Insecticide was found effective in keeping the adult vector density An.
      culicifacies to a very low level for a period of 14-16 wks. Both anopheline and
      culicine mosquitoes were affected by the spray. The trial confirmed its long
      residual effectiveness from 15 to 16 wks on both mud and cement plastered
      surfaces. Deltamethrin spray shortened the average life span of vector
      mosquitoes. Observations indicated that insecticide although has an
      excito-repellent effect on mosquitoes, thus forcing exodus from treated area but 
      with poor survival. Partial impact of deltamethrin spray was observed on the
      larval population confirm this. Deltamethrin spray did not exhibit any fumigant
      effect on mosquitoes. Significant decline in SPR from 17.93 to 4.26% was observed
      in areas sprayed with deltamethrin as compared to the comparison area. Similarly,
      SfR showed 81% reduction in experimental area while the control area showed
      increase by 42 per cent. No ill-effect of spray was noticed on the inhabitants,
      spray personnels, animal population and other non-target organisms of the area.
      The acceptability of the deltamethrin spray was found to be very high.

TI  - Studies on the Plasmodium vivax relapse pattern in Delhi, India.
PG  - 175-9
AB  - A five-year epidemiologic study of patients attending a malaria clinic in Delhi
      was conducted to find the relapse rate of infections with Plasmodium vivax, its
      seasonal correlation between the primary infection and subsequent relapses, the
      duration of the incubation period, and the patterns of relapse. By our
      definition, the relapse rate ranged from 23% to 44% depending on the duration of 
      follow-up. The relapse pattern observed in the study clearly suggests the
      existence of both tropical and temperate zone types of P. vivax in the population
      characterized by distinct incubation periods and the possible existence of P.
      vivax subpopulations characterized by primary long incubation periods. The
      implication of different incubating forms of P. vivax on the epidemiology and
      control of malaria is also discussed.

AB  - Although Ronald Ross carried out his pioneering investigations on the role of the
      mosquito in the transmission of malaria in India, antimalarial activities in the 
      sub-continent were disappointing. After the unsuccessful attempt at mosquito
      control at the military cantonment at Mian Mir (near Lahore, present day
      Pakistan), quinine prophylaxis was adopted as a compromise solution. While this
      strategy also failed, a good deal of important work was carried out in India in
      the first two decades of the twentieth century, so that by the 1920s, the
      magnitude of the malaria problem was fully appreciated.

TI  - Malaria in Maremma, Italy.
PG  - 1246-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In August, 1997, a woman with no history of travel to malarious
      regions developed Plasmodium vivax malaria. She lived in a rural area of Italy
      where indigenous Anophyles labranchiae mosquitoes were present. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: An environmental investigation was done within a 3 km radius of the
      patient's house. Adult mosquitoes and larvae were collected and examined by PCR
      with the gene for plasmodium circumsporozoite protein as target. About 200 people
      living in the area were interviewed to detect possible carriers of P. vivax.
      FINDINGS: None of the mosquitoes captured were carrying any malarial organisms.
      The house-to-house investigation identified a 7-year-old girl who had had a
      feverish illness a few days after her arrival in Italy from India, and who, 3
      months later, still had P. vivax in her blood; she and her mother had
      antimalarial antibodies. INTERPRETATION: These investigations suggest that the
      index case of malaria was caused by local anopheline mosquitoes infected with
      exogenous P. vivax.

TI  - Synthesis of some novel 2-oxo-pyrano(2,3-b)- and 2-oxo-pyrido(2,3-b)quinoline
      derivatives as potential antimalarial, diuretic, clastogenic and antimicrobial
      agents.
PG  - 50-4
AB  - The 2-chloro-3-formyl quinoline derivatives (1a-e) on treatment with acetic
      anhydride and sodium acetate, afforded the corresponding novel 2-oxopyrano(2,3-b)
      quinoline derivatives (2a-e), and these were subjected to ammonia treatment to
      yield the corresponding naphthyridine derivatives (3a-e). The prepared compounds 
      (2a-e) were tested for their antimalarial, diuretic, clastogenic and
      antimicrobial properties. Not all the compounds showed a diuretic effect and the 
      significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei shows that they are
      non-clastogens, whereas the 7-chloro derivative (2e) was a very effective
      antimalarial agent against the mosquito species. All the compounds were found to 
      have optimum antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia
      coli and Salmonella typhi. Compounds 2d and 2e were found to be most active
      against the bacteria tested.

PG  - 610-4
AB  - Longitudinal surveys at monthly frequency were carried out during 1995-1996 in a 
      forest fringed village of district Dibrugarh, Assam to decipher the breeding and 
      day resting habitats of Anopheles dirus. It regularly bred in small, shallow,
      rain filled, transient, shady or partly shady puddles/ground pools in the rainy
      months and in the perinneal streams in the adjoining forest of the village during
      dry months. In pools, the degree of interspecific association (0.238 +/- 0.174)
      and index of association (0.428) of An. dirus breeding was highest with Aedes
      caecus. An. dirus was completely exophilic and rested during day time in the
      forest mostly on tree trunks upto the height of 4-5 feet from the ground in dark 
      moist niches avoiding direct sun light.

      surfaces against malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies.
PG  - 606-9
AB  - Residual efficacy of deltamethrin 2.5 wp on various types of surfaces was tested 
      against Anopheles culicifacies under field conditions using WHO standard
      procedure. Deltamethrin was most effective on the thatched surface and produced
      100% mortality of An. culicifacies adults up to 12 weeks, even when exposed at
      the lowest dose /12.5 mg/m2. It was least effective on brick surface and 100%
      mortality was observed only for three weeks. The efficacy was observed for 8 and 
      7 weeks on mud and cement surfaces, respectively. However, at the higher rate of 
      application, i.e. 25 mg/m2, 100% mortality of this species was obtained for 12,
      10, 9 and 12 weeks on mud, cement, brick and thatch surfaces, respectively.

AB  - Alongitudinal study was conducted in four indicator villages of PHC Shankargarh, 
      District Allahabad, U.P. from July 1991 to June 1992 to have information on
      seasonality of indoor resting anopheline species in silica sand/hard stone quarry
      area. Fourteen anopheline species namely, An. aconitus (0.35%), An. annularis
      (17.03%), An. barbirostris (0.09%), An. culicifacies (36.74%), An. fluviatilis
      (0.13%), An. nigerrimus (0.01%), An. pallidus (4.40%), An. splendidus (0.02%),
      An. stephensi (0.01%), An. subpictus (40.84%), An. tessellatus (0.15%), An.
      turkhudi (0.004%), An. vagus (0.20%) and An. varuna (0.02%) were collected. An.
      culicifacies, An. subpictus and An. annularis were found throughout the year. An.
      fluviatilis, An. pallidus, An. vagus and An. aconitus were also observed in all
      the seasons except extreme summer. However, An. barbirostris and An. splendidus
      were collected only in monsoon/post-monsoon and winter seasons. An. tessellatus
      and An. stephensi were recorded in winter and spring seasons. An. nigerrimus and 
      An. varuna were recorded in winter, while An. turkhudi in spring. Prolonged high 
      vector density may be attributed to the extended malaria transmission in this
      area.

PG  - 117-25
AB  - Seasonal abundance of Anopheles dirus (s.l.) and malaria prevalence in an
      isolated forest fringed village was monitored at monthly intervals during August 
      1995 to July 1996. An. dirus was the only vector species detected during the
      study period. Its density pattern showed distinct seasonality with the peak
      occurring in the month of July and very low number during cool dry months.
      Positive correlation (r = 0.721) was found between the density of An. dirus and
      the amount of rainfall occurring two weeks prior to the collections. Overall
      sporozoite rate of 1.6% and parous rate of 64.7% were found in the study. Malaria
      transmission closely followed the density pattern of An. dirus and was seasonal
      with slide positivity rate and P. falciparum percentage of 47 and 83%
      respectively. Mean malaria prevalence was higher (p < 0.05) in females.

PG  - 379-83
AB  - Isofemale cultures of wild-caught Anopheles culicifacies collected from 11
      localities representing different ecoepidemiological zones on the mainland of
      India were identified by examining both F1 male larval mitotic karyotypes and
      polytene chromosomes of half-gravid F1 adult females. All cultures identified as 
      species A by polytene chromosome examination had submetacentric Y chromosomes. In
      species B and C, some isofemale cultures had acrocentric Y chromosomes, whereas
      others were submetacentric. The study revealed the existence of a Y chromosome
      polymorphism in species B and C; consequently, male mitotic karyotypes are of
      limited use for differentiating members of the An. culicifacies complex.

AB  - Entomological investigation during an outbreak of malaria in Gorubandha PHC in

      followed by An.minimus. Parity rates of both the species were very high, 65% and 
      62.2% respectively. An. culicifacies was incriminated as malaria vector.
      Sporozoite rate recorded was 0.63%. Both the species were found susceptible to
      DDT. This substantiates the epidemiological observation which yielded 98%
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria out of 35.2% malaria positive cases. Incrimination 
      of An. culicifacies means adding one more malaria vector to this region.

TI  - Bioenvironmental control of industrial malaria at Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 
      Hardwar, India--results of a nine-year study (1987-95).
PG  - 278-85
AB  - A bioenvironmental model to control malaria at Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. in
      Hardwar was developed by using existing resources to reduce mosquito breeding.
      The civil maintenance department carried out major source reduction work by
      filling pits, low lying areas, ditches, etc., with fly ash from a coal-fired
      power station, construction of stand posts and proper drainage, mosquito proofing
      of overhead tanks, and preventive maintenance of the water supply and the sewage 
      system. The project staff has applied 1) expanded polystyrene beads to
      underground tanks, leaking sluice valve chambers, and blocked sewage manholes; 2)
      biolarvicides to water accumulated in factory scraps, blocked drains, and
      riverbed pools, and 3) larvivorous fish to storm water drains, effluent ponds,
      and drains for the effective control of mosquito breeding. Improved surveillance 
      and treatment coupled with comprehensive developmental schemes were additional
      tools to gain community support. As a result of intervention measures, the vector
      density in the township was significantly lowered compared to that of a control
      area, and there was a drastic reduction in malaria incidence compared to that of 
      the preintervention year: only 190 cases were recorded in 1995, compared to 3,049
      cases in 1985. The study has shown that malaria control in an industrial township
      through an integrated control approach is practical, sustainable, and
      economically feasible and reduces insecticide pollution in the environment.

TI  - Variation in cuticular hydrocarbons among strains of Anopheles (Cellia) stephensi
      Liston possibly related to prior insecticide exposure.
PG  - 649-59
AB  - Cuticular lipids were extracted in hexane from the females of four strains of
      Anopheles stephensi and separated by capillary gas chromatography. When the
      chromatograms produced were quantified and compared by discriminant analysis,
      compositional variations in the hydrocarbons indicated that two of the strains,
      'Russ' (originally isolated in the former (U.S.S.R.) and 'Iraq' (from Iraq), both
      of which were susceptible to DDT and malathion, could be confidently separated
      from 'Beech' from India and 'St Mal' from Pakistan, both of which were resistant 
      to DDT and malathion. A high degree of hydrocarbon segregation between each of
      the four strains might be associated with geographical variation. It appears that
      there are significant and real differences in the hydrocarbons of these strains
      and these may be at least partially related to genetic alterations resulting from
      prior insecticide exposure. However, far more analysis is required if any
      relationship with prior exposure is to be confirmed.

TI  - Characterization of insect cell lines: heteroduplex analysis employing a
      mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragment.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - Routine cell line characterization procedures are not adequate for characterizing
      the cell lines of insect origin. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences and their
      comparisons have been used successfully for delineating species and phylogenetic 
      analysis. Using similar principles, we have standardized a protocol for the
      confirmation of species identity of insect cell lines. The procedure includes PCR
      amplification of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fragment from the cell line and 
      larvae of known insect species and heteroduplex analysis to detect the sequence
      variation in the PCR-amplified rRNA gene fragments. If the PCR fragment of the
      cell lines yields a homoduplex with the larvae of known species, then the cell
      line is conspecific with the larvae. If the larvae and cell line are of two
      different species, then the analysis exhibits multiple bands of heteroduplexes.
      The technique also allows detection of cross-contamination of culture having two 
      insect cell lines belonging to two different species.

TI  - Anopheline species complexes & malaria control.
PG  - 164-73
AB  - Species complexes comprising morphologically indistinguishable biological species
      that are reproductively isolated, are of common occurrence among anophelines. A
      list of anopheline species complexes identified so far in the world has been
      given. To demonstrate the importance of species complexes in malaria control, we 
      report the Anopheles culicifacies complex as a case study. An. culicifacies is a 
      major vector of malaria in India and neighbouring countries. This complex
      comprises four sibling species, A, B, C and D. Stratification of U.P. state and
      district Allahabad has been shown taking into consideration the biological
      differences among sibling species, viz., sibling species composition and
      vectorial potential- species B is a non-vector while others are vectors. To
      achieve cost effective vector control, microlevel stratification at least at the 
      block level has been suggested. Implications of differential responses of sibling
      species to DDT and malathion in field operations have been discussed. To achieve 
      selective and sustainable control, and to reduce the unnecessary selection
      pressure of insecticides, an insecticide spray strategy to control An.
      culicifacies has been provided.

TI  - Urban malaria vector biology.
PG  - 149-63
AB  - One of the main reasons for the set-back in the urban malaria control programme
      is the peculiar biobehaviour of the principal urban malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi. Certain relevant facts such as incrimination as the vector of malaria,
      sibling or biological species, resting habitat, manlanding behaviour, seasonal
      prevalence, blood meal analysis, longevity, parity status, daily survival and
      mortality rates of adults, breeding habitats and vertical distribution of larvae 
      of An. stephensi have been discussed. Determination of density of the vector
      using various parameters and their relation to malaria endemicity in an urban
      situation have been reviewed. An. stephensi has become resistant to DDT, HCH,
      malathion and propoxur in many places in India. Hence for control source
      reduction, use of predators such as fish and biolarvicides such as Bacillus
      thuringiensis var israelensis H14 and B. sphaericus, personal protection, i.e.,
      use of appropriate clothing, bed nets, indigenous repellents, etc., information, 
      education and communication (IEC) are to be stressed.

TI  - Severe and complicated malaria in Bikaner (Rajasthan), western India.
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Severe and complicated malaria is an important cause of mortality in Plasmodium
      falciparum infection. We describe in this study the details of 532 cases of such 
      syndromes admitted to hospital during an outbreak of malaria between
      September-December 1994. Increase in the annual rain fall, collection of water
      around Indra Gandhi Canal, forestation of shrubs around it and migration of
      labor, adaptation of Anopheles stephensi to desert climate and favorable breeding
      of An. culicifacies in the areas under impact of irrigation were presumptive
      causes of the outbreak in this region. Cerebral malaria (25.75%), hepatic
      involvement (11.47%), spontaneous bleeding (9.58%), hemoglobinuria (7.89%),
      severe anemia (5.83%), algid malaria (5.26%), ARDS (3%) and renal failure (2.07%)
      were the important manifestations. The overall mortality was 11.09%, which was
      high because of infection in the non-immune population of this area. Ignorance
      about the severity of this disease and lack of transportation facility was
      another important factor. Morality was highest in ARDS (81.25%) followed by
      severe anemia (70.97%), algid malaria (46.43%), renal failure (45.45%), jaundice 
      (36.06%) and cerebral malaria (33.57%). Pregnancy was an important determinant
      increasing the mortality in female patients. Mortality was very high (82.35%) in 
      those persons who presented with more than 3 syndromes together.

TI  - Efficacy of light-traps in sampling malaria vectors in different ecological zones
      in central India.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - This preliminary field study was designed chiefly to test the efficiency of the
      light-trap as a tool for sampling malaria vectors, in tribal villages located in 
      different ecological settings in comparison with indoor resting collections as an
      alternative method. Anopheles culicifacies, a known malaria vector, was the most 
      prevalent species in the study villages and more than 80% of trap catches were
      obtained before midnight with peak activity during dusk. Reproductive status of
      trapped specimens revealed proportional representations of unfed, freshly fed,
      and gravid females. Another vector, An. fluviatilis was found in small numbers by
      both the methods. Thus the trap could give a reliable and unbiased sample of
      vector population. Seven species were abundant in the light-trap catches while
      only four in the indoor resting collections indicates the usefulness of the
      light-trap for sampling exophilic species. The study revealed that light-traps
      did not have any bias in favor of any particular species. The method may be
      useful for assessing the night time densities of different species or the
      fluctuation of a species at different dates and village to village variations.
      Light-traps could be used for sampling both endophilic and exophilic anophelines.

      16 species belonging to Genera Anopheles (2), Culex (3), Aedes (8), Armigeres
      (1), Orthopodomyia (1) and Toxorhynchites (1) were found breeding in the
      treeholes, while 20 species including disease vectors An. culicifacies, Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Ae. albopictus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui were
      found resting. The study showed that so far malaria vectors have not exploited
      the breeding potential of treeholes but Aedes albopictus, vector of dengue/
      dengue haemorrhagic fever in Asia, was one of the main species breeding and
      resting in the treeholes. The paper describes seasonality, interspecific
      association and some new species breeding/resting in treeholes in Orissa.

AB  - Variations in the allelic composition of glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI),
      NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme
      systems of Plasmodium vivax were observed in isolates of Indian origin in
      1985-1993. No significant difference was observed in allelic frequencies in
      different years. The data indicated random distribution of GPI, GDH and ADA
      alleles among the isolates, suggesting that loci for these enzymes were not
      linked. A high proportion of the isolates comprised at least 2 genetically
      distinct clones, the mean number of clones per isolate being 1.4. There was no
      significant difference in the number of oocysts in Anopheles stephensi fed on
      uniclonal and multiclonal isolates. No difference was observed in the proportions
      of uniclonal and multiclonal isolates during low and high transmission periods.

AB  - A total of 41,552 anophelines comprising 16 species were collected during 70
      all-night bovine-bait collection carried out in six villages of Kheda district,
      Gujarat. Anopheles subpictus, An. varuna, An. culicifacies, An. stephensi and An.
      vagus had unimodal biting rhythms. Most feeding occurred during the early night
      with occasional increase during pre-dawn/dawn hours. An. pallidus exhibited
      bimodal biting rhythm with two well-defined peaks. An. turkhudi, An. tessellatus,
      An. fluviatilis, An. aconitus, An. annularis; An. barbirostris and An. nigerrimus
      had multimodal biting rhythms or were arthymic. An. culicifacies, An. varuna, An.
      aconitus and An. tessellatus exhibited a marked seasonal shift in feeding
      activities with most biting occurring at dusk in colder months and late at night 
      during warmer months.

PG  - 287-98
AB  - Cyfluthrin (Solfac**) 10 wp, a synthetic pyrethroid was evaluated for its
      efficacy in malaria control through primary health centre approach, and for its
      acceptance by the community and effect on human health, and non target organisms,
      in predominantly tribal areas of Maharashtra and Gujarat from 1988 to 1990. Two
      dosage schedules; 2 rounds of indoor residual sparying a year, at 25 mg/sq. m2 in
      Maharashtra, and 3 rounds a year at 15 mg/sq. m2, in Gujarat were followed. There
      was significant reduction in per man hour densities of An. culicifacies the
      principal malaria vector, and collaterally of C. quinquefasciatus also.
      Significant reductions in slide positivity rates and slide falciparum rates were 
      observed in both the areas as compared to the controls. The community acceptance 
      of Cyfluthrin in terms of room coverage was 96% in Gujarat, and 89% in
      Maharashtra, as against average 68.5% and 55% in case of DDT and Malathion
      respectively. There were no reported ill-effects on humans or non-target
      organisms.

PG  - 279-86
AB  - A nine month entomological study was conducted from August 1989 to April 1990 in 
      Jalpaiguri duars of West Bengal where malaria has been persistent problem.
      Amongst the anopheline fauna three vector species were recorded; An. minimus was 
      the principal vector supported by A. dirus during the rainy months and An.
      fluviatilis in dry months. All the three vectors were found in close association 
      with human orbit and An. minimums was found to be primarily a domestic vector.
      The primary role of An. minimus in the transmission of malaria in the region has 
      been highlighted. Observations on seasonal variation, biting preferences, and
      biting time and vector infection rates were recorded.

PG  - 491-5
AB  - In a developing country like India, classification and identification of the
      species of Anopheline mosquitoes in control operations of mosquito-borne diseases
      is of paramount importance. The WHO monograph, which describes the taxonomic data
      in the form of a pictorial key is generally difficult to understand by a
      non-taxonomist. Utilizing the principles of ID3 algorithm, a novel rule-based
      system, for the fast identification of unknown species of Indian Anopheline
      mosquitoes, is developed. The rule-based system is user-friendly, menu-driven and
      even a novice can make use of it in the identification of the unknown species
      with little practice. The above software is available on floppy disk and can be
      obtained with a minimum cost. This program can be ported on 5 1/4" or 3 1/2"
      floppy disk.

PG  - 277-82
AB  - Fourth-instar larvae of mosquitoes Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti normally
      died within 90 min at 43 degrees C. Pre-exposure to high but sublethal
      temperatures conferred adaptive thermotolerance, dependent on the temperature and
      the duration of pre-exposure. Adaptive cross-tolerance to propoxur (a carbamate
      insecticide) was also induced in larvae by pre-exposing them to sublethal
      temperatures. Pre-exposure to sublethal concentrations of propoxur was found to
      confer cross-thermotolerance to a lower extent. These results suggest that the
      shock proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins) induced by unrelated stress factors
      play an important role in the development of adaptive cross-protection (stress
      response) to other stress conditions.

AB  - The feeding behavior of Anopheles dirus, the forest breeding, major malaria
      vector in northeast India was studied. The analysis of blood meals collected from
      this mosquito revealed that the species was highly anthropophilic in nature, the 
      anthropophilic index being 90.5. The results of bait collection on human and
      cattle bait also confirmed its biting preference for human hosts. The species was
      observed to land on human bait throughout the night, showing prominent biting
      time at 20.00-21.00, 23.00-24.00 and 02.00-03.00 hours during the study period.

      in Beel Akbarpur village, District Ghaziabad, India.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - A field trial in Beel Akbarpur village, Dadri PHC, District Ghaziabad (U.P.) was 
      carried out to test the impact of burning neem oil in kerosene lamp from
      dusk-to-dawn in living rooms on vector populations and incidence of malaria.
      Results revealed that burning 1% neem oil in kerosene lamps resulted in the
      deviation of An. culicifacies from living rooms to cattlesheds. This was also
      reflected when malaria incidence was compared in experimental and control
      villages. Cases/000 and Pf/000 were 1.03 and 0.0 in experimental village as
      against 9.6 and 4.3 in control village. Discontinuation of burning 1% neem oil in
      kerosene lamp resulted in recurrence of An. culicifacies in living rooms and
      increase in malaria incidence in experimental village.

PG  - 61-6
AB  - Insect growth regulators (IGRs) namely, Isopropyl
      (E-E)-(RS)-11-methoxy-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2, 4-dinoate (Methoprene) and
      1-(4-cyclophenyl)-3-(2,6-diflerobenzoyl) urea (Diflubenzuron) were evaluated
      against mosquito larvae in laboratory as well as in different breeding habitats
      in Tezpur, Assam. LC90 values of diflubenzuron against Culex quinquefasciatus and
      Aedes albopictus were 0.0022 and 0.0027 ppm respectively, while it was 0.0027 and
      0.0022 ppm respectively in case of methoprene. However, LC50 values of both the
      IGRs were almost same in case of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus (varies 
      between 0.0009 and 0.0011 ppm). In case of methoprene, maximum mortality was
      observed in pupal stage though the exposure was given in all the cases to the III
      instar larvae. Field trials were conducted in cemented drains, small ponds and
      ditches. At 0.2 ppm (0.020 kg/ha) both diflubenzuron and methoprene were found to
      eliminate 92-96 per cent Culex and Anopheles larvae. Methoprene and diflubenzuron
      were found equally effective for control of mosquito breeding in different
      breeding habitats and provide better efficacy than conventional larvicides and
      biocides.

TI  - Dynamics of malaria transmission in forested and deforested regions of Mandla
      District, central India (Madhya Pradesh).
PG  - 225-34
AB  - A longitudinal malaria study was undertaken in 1990-91 in 2 adjacent ecological
      zones in central India: villages in forest and villages away from the forest. The
      prevalence of Anopheles species varied widely between the 2 ecological settings. 
      In the villages in forest, Anopheles culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were mainly
      exophilic, whereas in the villages away from forest, An. culicifacies was
      predominantly endophilic and An. fluviatilis was equally prevalent both indoors
      and outdoors. The seasonal patterns of malaria transmission were also different
      between the 2 zones. Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant parasite species in
      the villages in forest, whereas malaria infection was mainly due to Plasmodium
      vivax in the villages away from forest. The annual parasite incidence was high in
      the villages in forest. The failure to control malaria in forested areas is
      rooted in the terrain and a variety of poorly understood sociological factors.

AB  - The bioefficacy of mats, coils and dispensers containing allethrin group of
      synthetic pyrethroids was studied against laboratory strains of Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. Except esbiothrin in the
      mat formulation which was 100 and 178 times more effective against Cx.
      quinquefasciatus than against Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi with KT50 of 0.005,
      0.5 and 0.89 min. respectively, all the three allethrins in mat or coil
      formulations were equally effective against the three vector mosquitoes. When
      compared to mat formulations of d-allethrin and bioallethrin, mat formulation of 
      esbiothrin was 156 and 144 times more effective against Cx. quinquefasciatus. It 
      was 162 times more effective against Cx. quinquefasciatus than in the coil
      formulation. Dispenser containing d-allethrin was the least effective against Cx.
      quinquefasciatus (KT50: 2.65 min.) and Ae. aegypti (KT50: 4.68 min.) but as
      effective as coil against An. stephensi. When mat and dispenser heated or coil
      burnt continuously for 10 hours the knockdown was consistently above 60% in all
      the three vector species but mortality was not consistently > 60% in Ae. aegypti.
      Repellent effect of the formulations ranged from 0.0 to 80.3%, 0 to 57.3% and
      59.2 to 78.3% against Cx. quinquefasciatus Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi
      respectively. Repellency was more against An. stephensi than against the other
      two species. Mats and coils deterred > 50% of the mosquitoes from feeding on the 
      chicken (range: 50 to 99.52%) but in case of dispenser the effect was only 14.72 
      to 65.01%. The use of these formulations as a control tools in reducing
      man-vector contact is discussed.

PG  - 299-303
AB  - Investigations on the current response of A. stephensi. to six insecticides viz. 
      DDT, dieldrin, malathion, fenitrothion, propoxur and permethrin, were carried out
      in 3 districts i.e. Barmer, Jodhpur and Pali, of the Thar desert. The species was
      found resistant to DDT and dieldrin, partially resistant to malathion and
      susceptible to fenitrothion, propoxur and permethrin. Dieldrin and malathion
      resistance has been detected for the first time in the Thar desert. Lethal
      concentrations (LC50 & LC95) of DDT and dieldrin and lethal exposure times (LT50 
      & LT95) of malathion, fenitrothion, propoxur and permethrin have been determined.
      In some areas, the differences in LC50 and LT50 values of tested insecticides,
      except fenitrothion, were found statistically significant. Chi-square and
      regression tests have revealed the homogeniety and linear trend respectively in
      the response of A. stephensi to insecticides. The findings of the study indicate 
      that organochlorine compounds can be used alternately in the spray operations.

TI  - Gametocytocidal activity of alpha/beta arteether by the oral route of
      administration.
PG  - 652-4
AB  - Arteether (alpha/beta) (a mixture of alpha and beta enantioners) has been
      reported to possess gametocytocidal activity against Plasmodium cynomolgi B when 
      the drug is given by the intramuscular route, but it would be preferable to use
      oral route therapy for gametocyte carriers. This is a report of a study of the
      gametocytocidal action of arteether administered by the oral route. The results
      indicate high levels of activity at 10 mg/kg in a single dose or in two divided
      doses when given orally.

PG  - 251-4
AB  - The water-soluble artemisinin analogue sodium beta-artelinate, a fast-acting
      blood schizontocide, was evaluated for gametocytocidal action against simian
      malaria Plasmodium cynomolgi B, and a single dose of the compound has been found 
      to be an effective gametocytocide by both oral and intravenous routes. The
      compound was able to sterilize the circulating gametocytes in rhesus monkey,
      resulting in loss of mosquito infectivity and oocyst development in the Anopheles
      stephensi. However, no sporontocidal action has been observed with this compound.

AB  - A widespread outbreak of malaria occurred in different districts of lower Assam
      in April, 1995. Entomological investigations were carried out in Primary Health
      Centre Tamulpur, the worst hit area of Nalbari district. Of the nine anopheline
      species collected, Anopheles minimus was incriminated as the malaria vector with 
      sporozoite rate of 6.5 per cent. The slow moving streamlets were identified as
      the sole breeding places of An. minimus.

TI  - Toxicity of insecticides to Toxorhynchites splendens and three vector mosquitos
      and their sublethal effect on biocontrol potential of the predator.
PG  - 154-9
AB  - Toxicity of six larvicides ie fenthion, temephos, malathion, deltamethrin,
      alphamethrin (Fendona), OMS 3031 and five adulticides ie malathion, fenitrothion,
      propoxur, deltamethrin, permethrin to Aedes aegypti, Culex quiquefasciatus,
      Anopheles stephensi and the predator, Toxorhynchites splendens was studied for
      evaluating safety margin. Concentrations of alphamethrin that killed 50% larvae
      of T. splendens were 53 and 12 times more than that which killed Cx.
      quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti. In case of deltamethrin, concentrations
      required to kill 50% larvae of T. splendens were 14 and 5 times more than that
      required against other two species. Other larvicides tested were equally toxic to
      both T. splendens and vector mosquitos. There was no significant difference in
      the toxicity of larvicides to T. splendens and An. stephensi. Deltamethrin was
      25-132 times less toxic to adults of T. splendens in comparison to vector
      mosquitos. For other adulticides the range was 1-10. Immature developmental time 
      of T. splendens was not affected by any of the insecticides tested. However,
      predation rate was lowered when larvae of Ae. aegypti previously exposed to
      fenthion and temephos were offered. Whereas, alphamethrin and OMS 3031 did not
      affect the feeding rate of the predator. There was a significant reduction in the
      pupal weight and pupation as a result of the predator feeding on the insecticide 
      treated prey. There was a significant negative relationship between rate of
      pupation and dosage. The present study indicates that synthetic pyrethroids owing
      to their higher safety margin can be used in an integrated vector management
      program.

TI  - Brackish water mosquito problem of Vypeen Island, Cochin, Kerala.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - A preliminary study has shown that the marshy terrain and brackish water bodies
      associated with mangrove forests contributed profuse breeding of mosquitos in
      Vypeen island, causing a severe menace to the island population. A total of 14
      species belonging to four genera viz, Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres and Culex was
      recorded from different habitats. Culex sitiens was found to be the predominant
      mosquito in all the perennial breeding habitats. The extent of different habitats
      in the production of mosquitos, and its possible abatement, using environmental
      and/or biocontrol methods are discussed.

AB  - The impact of spraying Deltamethrin 2.5% w.d.p. @ 20 mg/m2 and its comparison
      with Malathion 25% w.d.p. @ 2 gr./m2 was assessed in Rameshwaram Island, Tamil
      Nadu. Monitoring of entomological and parasitological indices revealed that due
      to deltamethrin spray malaria transmission could be effectively interrupted and a
      significant reduction in malaria cases was achieved. P. falciparum cases also
      showed a significant reduction whereas in the comparison malathion areas
      reduction in malaria cases or in pf cases was not recorded.
