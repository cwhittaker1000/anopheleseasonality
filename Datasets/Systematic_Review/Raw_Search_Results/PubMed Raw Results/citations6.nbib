TI  - Effect of volatiles from neem and other natural products on gonotrophic cycle and
      oviposition of Anopheles stephensi and An. culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 195-201
AB  - The gonotrophic cycle of female Anopheles was impaired by exposure to volatiles
      of neem, (Azadirachta indica), reetha, (Sapindus mukorossi), and garlic, (Allium 
      sativum), but not to castor seeds and cotton seed oil. A brief exposure to
      contact or volatile extracts from neem suppressed rather than inhibited
      oviposition. Complete inhibition of oviposition was observed by exposure of
      mosquitoes to neem oil and 1 fraction containing volatile components.
      Vitellogenesis was impaired irreversably by long-term exposure to neem odor and
      some extracts. The effect of volatiles on oviposition seems to be regulated by
      absorption through the cuticle, although passage through the spiracles could not 
      be excluded.

PG  - 147-9
AB  - The host feeding specificity of Anopheles fluviatilis sibling species S, T, and U
      was determined by analyzing blood meal source using countercurrent
      immunoelectrophoresis. A distinct difference in the feeding patterns was observed
      among these species. Species S was found to be predominantly anthropophagic with 
      91% of the population having fed on human blood. In contrast, species T and U
      were either exclusively or primarily zoophagic.

AB  - Mosquito breeding in relation to aquatic vegetation and certain physico-chemical 
      parameters was studied in rice fields of Kheda district in central Gujarat. A
      total of 14 anopheline and 15 culicine species were encountered in close
      association with different types of aquatic vegetation in different proportions. 
      Among anophelines, Anopheles annularis, An. nigerrimus, An. subpictus and An.
      tessellatus were of general distribution and were found associated with each
      aquatic vegetation. An. culicifacies showed poor association with most of the
      aquatic weeds. Maximum number of anophelines were found associated with algae.
      Culex vishnui sub-group predominated among culicines and showed frequent
      association with Ceratophyllum, Hydrilla and algae. Physico-chemical parameters
      also exerted some impact on mosquito larval population.

TI  - Malaria survey in Tarajulie tea estate and adjoining hamlets in Sonitpur
      District, Assam.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - Malaria survey in Tarajulie tea estate (TE) and its adjoining hamlets revealed
      that Pf was the predominant parasite species (79%) and morbidity was alarming.
      Malaria positive cases were recorded in all age groups including infants.
      However, morbidity was much pronounced in the hamlets than among garden dwellers.
      Mostly Anopheles minimus were recorded in the day resting collections from human 
      dwellings (indoor) and in overnight man biting catches in the hamlets. From these
      collections. An. minimus was incriminated and the sporozoite infection rate was
      found to be 4.23 per cent. An. minimus were not recorded in the garden premises. 
      Thus morbidity in the garden population was attributed to the movement of
      labourers to and fro between hamlets and the garden premises. The hamlets served 
      as reservoirs for malaria infection.

      Orissa.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - A hut-scale trial of pyraclofos 50% EC applied as an indoor residual spray at 1
      gm/sq m was carried out against malaria vectors. Anopheles fluviatilis and An.
      culicifacies in Kandhaguda village of Malkangiri district, Orissa. Bandhaguda
      village was kept as control. Pyraclofos was effective in reducing the vector
      density by 80-96% after 24 h of spray, but the density increased within three
      weeks. Parity rates were reduced only for three weeks as measured by diurnal
      indoor resting collection. Contact bioassays on mud wall showed pyraclofos has a 
      residual life of only three weeks. No adverse effect was noticed among villagers 
      or spraymen. Cockroaches were found to be very sensitive to this compound.

TI  - Insecticide susceptibility status of some anophelines in district Bikaner,
      Rajasthan.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Insecticide susceptibility tests were conducted on the adults of four anopheline 
      species namely. Anopheles annularis, An. culicifacies, An. stephensi and An.
      subpictus against the diagnostic doses of six insecticides, viz. DDT (4.0%),
      dieldrin (0.4%), malathion (5.0%). fenitrothion (1.0%), propoxur (0.1%) and
      permethrin (0.25%) in District Bikaner (Rajasthan). A time dependent effect has
      been observed with each insecticide. All the four species were found resistant to
      DDT and dieldrin and susceptible to fenitrothion and permethrin. An culicifacies 
      and An. subpictus showed susceptibility to malathion, while further verification 
      for the other two species was required. However, with propoxur An. annularis
      showed resistance, whereas for other three species further studies are required. 
      DDT and dieldrin, the two organochlorines, were found least effective as compared
      to organophosphates and carbamates.

TI  - Anopheles minimus: its bionomics and role in the transmission of malaria in
      Assam, India.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - Indoor, day-resting collections of Anopheles minimus mosquitos from human
      dwellings in the study area in Assam, India, indicated that these insects were
      prevalent throughout the year and that their maximum abundance occurred from
      March to August. A. minimus was identified as a vector of malaria, and sporozoite
      infections were recorded every month of the year, with the highest rating
      occurring in October. The mosquito was highly anthropophilic and fed on human
      hosts (indoor) all through the night, but feeding was more pronounced between
      01:00 and 04:00, the person-biting rate was 13.7 per night. Breeding occurred
      throughout the year in slow-flowing streams with grassy banks. A. fluviatilis was
      also identified as a vector of malaria in the study area but occurred in low
      density, and sporozoite infections were only seasonal.

      habitats associated with rice land agroecosystem of terai and bhabar area of
      District Naini Tal was studied from July 1992 to June 1994. Adult prevalence in
      both the areas shows two distinct An. fluviatilis peaks in the months of March
      and October and the breeding places for the species were pokhars in bhabar and
      stream and irrigation drains in terai. Prevalence of adult An. culicifacies was
      observed during July to August in bhabar and April and August in terai. In bhabar
      high immature density of An. culicifacies was noted mainly in tanks, pokhars and 
      paddy fields (early transplantation period). In terai high immature density of
      An. culicifacies was noted in stream, while low in paddy fields. Higher
      prevalence of immatures and adult anopheline vectors coincide with peak malaria
      incidence in both the areas. In bhabar in the months of August and September
      large number of malaria cases were contributed by An. culicifacies and in
      November by An. fluviatilis. In terai, malaria cases in April and from June to
      September were contributed by An. culicifacies, whereas An. fluviatilis might be 
      responsible for transmission in October.

      Gujarat.
PG  - 140-52
AB  - Investigations were carried out in the villages of Buhari PHC, Surat district,
      Gujarat to determine factors responsible for high prevalence of P. falciparum.
      The area is well-known for sugarcane cultivation, industrialization and frequent 
      movement of labourers. The slide positivity rate (44.24%) and P. falciparum
      infections (95.37%) were significantly high. The children of 5-9 yrs of age group
      suffered maximum from malaria. The infection in children was found associated
      with splenomegaly also. High falciparum infection (82.35%) was found in labourers
      camping near villages out of which 90% afebrile cases were reported which were
      silent carriers and source of transmission. Chloroquine was effective in 75%
      cases despite of existence of resistant falciparum strain. Among seven anopheline
      species encountered, An. culicifacies was predominant and found breeding in most 
      of the breeding sites. The status of the insecticide spray and its receptivity
      among the community were poor. The investigation led to the conclusion that
      adequate measures are required to deal with migratory labourers, improper
      insecticide coverage, poor surveillance and mass ignorance.

TI  - Investigation of malaria outbreak in Rajasthan.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - Jaisalmer and Barmer districts in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan experienced an
      unprecedented rains during 1994 leading to an outbreak of malaria. Investigations
      were carried out at three sites in two districts (i) Pokaran PHC and (ii) Nachana
      PHC in Jaisalmer district and Dhorimana in Barmer district during November 1994. 
      Epidemiological and entomological studies in Pokaran PHC revealed presence of
      small foci of stable malaria. These foci were maintained by large bodies of water
      (ponds/lakes) drained from surrounding areas and spread over 1 to 5 sq km. Slide 
      positivity rate (SPR), slide falciparum rate (SfR) and child spleen rate (SR)
      were 60.1, 56.9 and 86.9%, respectively with 3 deaths reported. Adjoining
      villages experienced epidemic reporting deaths fed by the reservoir from these
      stable foci. An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were the major malaria vectors.
      Nachana PHC recorded stable malaria foci of irrigation malaria due to
      introduction of Indira Gandhi Canal (IGC). SPR, SfR and SR recorded were 52.35,
      50.58 and 80.8%, respectively. Transmission appeared to be maintained by An.
      stephensi, An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis in relays. An. fluviatilis seems 
      to have established breeding in silted grassy margins of IGC. Dhorimana PHC in
      border district was also found to be a stable malaria foci although with low
      malaria indices. However, An. culicifacies and expanded breeding potential of An.
      stephensi were the main factors in maintaining malaria endemicity in the region.

TI  - A study on insecticide resistance in Anopheles fluviatilis and anopheles
      culicifacies to HCH and DDT in the Malkangiri district of Orissa.
PG  - 112-8
AB  - The susceptibility status of malaria vectors to HCH and DDT was studied in
      Malkangiri district which has been highly endemic for malaria since many decades.
      An. fluviatilis is the major malaria vector and An. culicifacies is a secondary
      vector in the area. HCH is being used in malaria control programme from 1972
      onwards. Before to that, DDT was used. This study reports that An. fluviatilis
      has developed resistance to HCH and is susceptible to DDT. This is the first
      confirmed report of resistance of this species to HCH in Malkangiri district of
      Orissa. An. culicifacies was found to be resistant to both the insecticides.
      Extensive use of pesticides in agriculture and indoor residual spraying of HCH
      for malaria control might have led to the development of resistance in these
      malaria vectors.

TI  - Relative efficacy of various oils in repelling mosquitoes.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - Field studies were carried out to determine the relative efficacy of repellant
      action of vegetable, essential and chemical base oils against vector mosquitoes. 
      Results revealed that essential oils viz. Cymbopogan martinii martinii var. Sofia
      (palmarosa), Cymbopogan citratus (lemon grass) and Cymbopogan nardus (citronella)
      oils are as effective as chemical base oil namely mylol. These oils provide
      almost complete protection against Anopheles culicifacies and other anopheline
      species. Per cent protection against Culex quinquefasciatus ranged between
      95-96%. Camphor (C. camphora) oil also showed repellent action and provided 97.6%
      protection against An. culicifacies and 80.7% against Cx. quinquefasciatus.
      Vegetable oils namely mustard (B. compestris) and coconut (C. nucisera) showed
      repellent action, however the efficacy of these oils was not much pronounced
      against Cx. quinquefasciatus. Results of statistical analysis revealed
      significant difference between vegetable and essential oils (p < 0.01) against
      tested species of mosquitoes. Essential oils were found marginally superior in
      repellancy than camphor and mylol (p < 0.01) against An. culicifacies and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus.

AB  - We isolated a new larval color mutant, brown larva (b), from the Bangalore, India
      strain of Anopheles stephensi Liston. The gene b is an autosomal recessive with
      uniform expression and complete penetrance. We conducted extensive crosses to
      establish allelism between brown larva (b) and green larva (g) reported
      previously in An. stephensi from our laboratory. The wild-type is dominant to
      green larva, which, in turn, is dominant to brown larva. These larval color
      mutants belong to an allelic series.

AB  - Anopheline fauna of cattlesheds (CS) in Ajodhya hills, District Purulia,
      consisted of 12 species during summer, monsoon and 10 species during winter. Of
      the six vector species encountered in CS, Anopheles culicifacies, An. annularis, 
      An. subpictus, An. maculatus and An. fluviatilis were found in all the three
      seasons. An. philippinensis was encountered in monsoon only and constituted 0.61%
      of the total anopheline catch made during the season. An. culicifacies was the
      most predominant species during summer (MHD 30.38) and monsoon (MHD 11) but
      ranked third (MHD 9.64) to An. annularis (MHD 16.28) during winter; An. subpictus
      being second (MHD 10.28) in order of predominance. An. annularis was the second
      most prevalent vector species in summer (MHD 21.38) and monsoon (MHD 9.92). The
      population density of the remaining three vector species was extremely low in the
      two seasons. In human dwelling (HD), of the five anopheline species encountered
      (An. subpictus, An. annularis, An. culicifacies, An. vagus and An. splendidus),
      the former three were found in all the three seasons. MHD of An. annularis in HD 
      in summer, monsoon and winter was 3.7, 1.1 and 1.9 respectively, while MHD of An.
      culicifacies in the corresponding seasons was 5.01, 2.09 and 1.31 respectively.

AB  - Neem cream was used as mosquito repellent to provide protection against Aedes
      albopictus, Ae. aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles culicifacies and An.
      subpictus mosquitoes. The application of neem cream on exposed body parts @2.0
      gm/person showed 78 (range 65-95), 89 (range 66-100) and 94.4 (range 66-100) per 
      cent protection against Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes respectively.
      Significant difference was observed between neem cream treated and untreated
      group of population for Aedes mosquitoes (p < 0.001). Application of neem cream
      was found to be a safe and suitable alternative to insecticide impregnated coils 
      for personal protection against mosquitoes and one application was 68% effective 
      for four hours.

TI  - Pyrethroid-impregnated hessian curtains for protection against mosquitoes indoors
      in south India.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - Hessian curtains impregnated with deltamethrin 50 mg/m2 were hung in the eaves
      and doorways of eight one-roomed huts in Madurai, Tamil Nadu State, South India. 
      Statistically significant reductions of indoor-resting and man-biting densities
      of the mosquitoes Anopheles subpictus and Culex quinquefasciatus were observed
      for 14 weeks, in two field trials. Bioassays on curtains in the field showed over
      50% mortality of Cx quinquefasciatus and An.stephensi for up to 8 weeks. The
      curtains were highly acceptable to the community, and cost approximately Rs.33.15
      (US$1.05) for material and Rs.10 ($0.32) for delta-methrin per hut, totalling Rs 
      53.15 ($1.70) for two impregnations giving 6 months protection. Comparative costs
      of house-spraying with residual insecticides are estimated as Rs.1.92 ($0.06) for
      two rounds of DDT at 1 g/m2, or Rs.40 ($1.27) for three rounds of malathion at 2 
      g/m2. Therefore the relative annual cost of protection using
      deltamethrin-impregnated hessian curtains is 28 x or 1.3 x more than for
      house-spraying with DDT or malathion, respectively (excluding operational
      expenditure).

TI  - Deltamethrin impregnated bednets against Anopheles minimus transmitted malaria in
      Assam, India.
PG  - 73-83
AB  - Of the 20 Anopheles species caught in villages in Sonapur, Assam, only An.
      minimus was incriminated as a malaria vector by finding sporozoites in the
      salivary glands. It was found to be endophagic and endophilic in Assam and
      because its biting peaked after midnight it was a suitable target for insecticide
      impregnated bednets. After the withdrawal of DDT spraying and collecting a year's
      baseline data, deltamethrin impregnated nets were distributed in 3 villages,
      untreated nets were distributed in 6 villages and 3 were held as untreated
      controls. The population of each of these groups of villages was about 1700. The 
      nets were well received by the local tribal population. Human landing catches
      with baits unprotected or under partially lifted nets showed that the nets
      provided a high degree of personal protection against all the local species of
      human biting mosquito. In addition, there was evidence for suppression of the An.
      minimus population in a village with treated nets. Malaria was monitored by
      weekly active surveillance in all the villages. In the untreated control villages
      the slide positivity rate and monthly parasite index rose significantly during
      the trial. In the villages with untreated nets, these parameters showed no
      significant change, but in the villages with treated nets they declined
      significantly. On the basis of these results, the widespread distribution of
      impregnated nets was recommended to the state health authorities.

AB  - A systematic survey was carried out between April 1993 and March 1994 to study
      the distribution and prevalence of anopheline mosquito species in two
      malaria-prone areas situated in the foothills of Darjeeling district. Ten
      different species of Anopheles viz. An. aconitus, An. annularis, An.
      barbirostris, An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, An. hyrcanus group, An.
      maculatus, An. subpictus, An. vagus and An. varuna were collected. Per man hour
      density of mosquitoes collected was 4.5 and the most prevalent species was An.
      vagus, comprising 63% of the total catch. An. fluviatilis, an efficient vector of
      malaria in the foothill regions of India, was reported for the first time from
      this area. However, the classical vector of this region viz. An. minimus was
      altogether absent during the course of the present survey. All the ten species
      were found in cowsheds while, human habitation harboured higher population
      density (56.5%) of the total catch.

      Ethyl acetate (EA) 3:1 fraction of V. negundo, 1:1 fractions of N. oleander and
      S. jambolanum inflicted considerable larval mortality and interfered with
      pupal-adult metamorphosis. At very low concentration the active fractions of
      these plant extracts extended the duration of the various larval instars and of
      pupation. In general, I and II instar larvae were more susceptible to the active 
      fractions. Species and stage specific differences in the susceptibility of the
      mosquitoes to the active fractions of the plant extracts were observed.

AB  - The seasonal variation in the density of immature and adult malaria vectors
      Anopheles stephensi and An. culicifacies were recorded from January to December, 
      1986 in urban Gurgaon, India. The highest combined anopheline larval density (2.3

      vectors An. stephensi (4.14 per man hour) and An. culicifacies (1.02 per man
      hour) were reported in the month of August. The highest percentage of total
      infestation for anophelines and other breeding habitats were in tanks (48.72%)
      and ponds (6.41%) in Autumn and wells (4.79%) in the Winter season. The highest
      population of An. stephensi and An. culicifacies were collected from the
      peripheral area in comparison to central part of the study area. Maximum malaria 
      cases along with highest larval density (1.8 per dip) were recorded from Sector
      3.

PG  - 86-9
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (H-14), strain 164 (Bactoculicide) when applied at 1 g/m2 
      surface area successfully controlled Anopheles stephensi breeding in construction
      sites, abandoned overhead tanks, and curing waters. Subsequent to application, no
      pupal production was observed in these habitats for 3, 18, and 21 days,
      respectively. Based on these findings, inclusion of Bactoculicide in the
      bioenvironmental vector control strategy is suggested and fortnightly spraying in
      construction sites at 1 g/m2 surface area is recommended for the containment of
      vector breeding. However, frequent retreatment of abandoned overhead tanks would 
      be uneconomical and operationally impractical.

TI  - Development of combined use of neem (Azadirachta indica) and water management for
      the control of culicine mosquitoes in rice fields.
PG  - 25-33
AB  - Crude neem products have earlier shown considerable promise for control of
      culicine mosquito vectors in rice fields as a by-product of their agricultural
      use as fertilizers, but suffer from disadvantages of bulkiness and lack of
      stability in storage. Relatively stable lipid-rich fractions of neem were shown
      to be as effective as good-quality crude neem products in control of breeding of 
      culicine vectors of Japanese encephalitis, and also produced a slight but
      significant reduction in populations of anopheline pupae. Neem-based formulations
      coated over urea significantly increased grain yield, but used alone did not,
      whereas combining the use of neem-coated urea and water management by
      intermittent irrigation had a greater effect on grain yield than that of water
      management alone. The neem fractions were relatively cost-effective, and the
      combined water management and neem-coated urea strategy is acceptable to farmers,
      who are already aware of the benefits of the use of neem-coated urea, and of
      water management. This technology therefore has considerable promise as an
      environmentally benign method of rice-field mosquito control that could be
      sustainably implemented by farmers.

TI  - Malaria control utilizing Bacillus sphaericus against Anopheles stephensi in
      Panaji, Goa.
PG  - 534-9
AB  - In a large malaria endemic area in Panaji city, Goa, India, the weekly
      application of the biolarvicide Bacillus sphaericus (Strain 101, Serotype H 5a
      5b) at the rate of 1 g/m2 in the main Anopheles stephensi larval habitats, viz., 
      curing waters, masonry tanks, and sump tanks (under construction), from April to 
      December 1993 resulted in a sharp decline in the habitat positivity (range
      0.13-8.0%) as compared with the rest of the Panaji (range 2.2-30.6%) where
      temephos (Abate) was used as the larvicide. Bacillus sphaericus spraying also led
      to a significant decline in anopheline densities in positive habitats (range
      0-7.3/10 dips) as compared with control habitats (range 0.9-53.0/10 dips).
      Concurrently, malaria incidence observed in the experimental area (slide
      positivity rate [SPR] range 2.3-7.8%; monthly parasite index [MPI] range
      0.18-1.44) was lower than in the control area (SPR range 14.3-25.5%; MPI range
      1.75-6.12).

TI  - Reliability of light trap sampling for Anopheles fluviatilis, a vector of
      malaria.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - The utility of light traps for sampling Anopheles fluviatilis, the major malaria 
      vector in the hill tracts of Koraput district, Orissa, was assessed. A modified
      version of the CDC miniature light trap was used in the study. The data generated
      from light trap collections were analysed and compared with daytime resting,
      man-biting and night resting collections carried out in parallel. The number per 
      trap recorded in cattle sheds was significantly higher than that recorded in
      human dwellings. A similar pattern was observed in hand catches of indoor resting
      population though the difference was not significant. The density recorded from
      light traps over time was found to have a significant positive linear association
      with corresponding indoor (r = 0.625; p = 0.0019) as well as outdoor (r = 0.603; 
      p = 0.0029) diurnal resting densities. The proportion with different gonotrophic 
      stages varied significantly between different types of collections. The age
      structure of A. fluviatilis did not differ significantly with the types of
      collection. As the light trap catches reflect seasonal fluctuations in the
      diurnal resting collections, they can justifiably be used in monitoring the
      relative density of A. fluviatilis in the place of cumbersome hand catch methods.
      Other uses of light traps are also discussed.

TI  - Some naturally occurring phytophototoxins for mosquito control.
PG  - 745-51
AB  - Alpha-terthiophene (alpha-T) and erythrosin-B, the naturally occurring plant
      secondary metabolites, were tried for their phototoxic properties against
      Anopheles and Culex larvae under dark, ordinary tube light (1.9-2.4 w/m2) and sun
      light (680-840 w/m2). LC50 values of alpha-T for Anopheles larvae (4th instar)
      were found to be 154, 92 and 11 ppb under dark, tube light and sunlight,
      respectively. For Culex larvae corresponding LC50 values under different light
      conditions were 129, 97 and 22 ppb. Erythrosin-B under all photoregimens was
      found to be less toxic to larvae of both Anopheles and Culex sps. Also, the
      susceptibility of the mosquito species decreased with age, towards alpha-T and
      erythrosin-B. Cumulative effects in terms of delay in metamorphosis were also
      observed among survivors of such exposures. The effects of these compounds were
      also seen on the adults and developing unhatched embryos of a common aquatic
      snail (Lymnaea sps). The LC50 values of alpha-T for adults were found to be 39,
      23 ppm and 77 ppb under dark, tube light and sunlight and for developing
      unhatched embryos the corresponding values were 620, 41 and 13 ppb. Erythrosin-B 
      was found to be much less toxic under sunlight and dark, to both adults and
      embryos as compared to the toxicity of alpha-T. Potential use of such
      biodegradable and eco-friendly compounds of natural origin in mosquito control is
      discussed.

TI  - Composite fish culture for mosquito control in rice fields in southern India.
PG  - 522-7
AB  - Composite culture of edible fishes (common carp, Cryprinus carpio; silver carp,
      Hypopthalmithys molitrix, grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella; catla, Catla
      catla; rohu, Labeo rohita; and mrigal, Cirrhinus mrigala) in rice fields in the
      Cauvery delta of Tamil Nadu, southern India, resulted in 81.0% reduction in the
      immature mosquito population of anophelines and 83.5% of culicines. Analysis of
      fish feces for mosquito larval head capsules showed that common carp and silver
      carp are effective larvivores. The selective feeding of common carp on culicines 
      and silver carp on anophelines is correlated to their trophic niches. Net profit 
      in the fish-cum-rice fields was 2.5 times greater than fields in which rice alone
      was cultured. Hence, rice-cum-fish culture can be recommended to the farming
      community in this area.

AB  - Studies were carried out to evaluate the repellent action of Cymbopogan martinii 
      martinii Stapf var. sofia (F. Gramineae) against mosquitoes under field
      conditions. Results revealed that the oil has strong repellent action and
      provided absolute protection for 12 h against Anopheles culicifacies, a principal
      vector of malaria in the country. Similar degree of protection was evident
      against An. annularis and An. subpictus. The protection against Culex
      quinquefasciatus, a pest mosquito was 96.3% for 12 h. Results of evaluation in
      captivity revealed complete protection against this species for 5 h.

PG  - 103-14
AB  - Resting and biting habits of An. sundaicus were studied in Car Nicobar Island.
      Results of resting behaviour revealed that although substantial numbers of An.
      sundaicus rest outdoor, still the species prefer to rest indoors, and much less
      in human dwellings. High parity rate (73.38%) in An. sundaicus and close contact 
      with man were the factors responsible for high transmission in Car Nicobar. An.
      sundaicus population in Car Nicobar is susceptible to DDT. Indoor man-biting of
      An. sundaicus was significantly higher than outdoors and the species showed
      bimodal biting activity with first peak between 2130 to 2230 hrs and second
      between 0130 to 0230 hrs. An. sundaicus preferred to feed on people's legs and
      hands. Due to complex behaviour of An. sundaicus, an integrated approach
      comprising (i) chemical, (ii) bioenvironmental control, and (iii) personal
      protection methods was suggested to interrupt malaria transmission in Car Nicobar
      Island.

      aspects.
PG  - 137-47
AB  - Following the discovery of mosquito transmission of malaria, the theory and
      practice of malaria control by general and selective removal of specific vector
      populations resulted particularly from Malcolm Watson's empirical work in
      peninsular Malaysia, first in the urban and peri-urban areas of Klang and Port
      Swettenham and subsequently in the rural rubber plantations, and from the work of
      N.H. Swellengrebel in nearby Indonesia on the taxonomy, ecology and control of
      anophelines. They developed the concept of species sanitation: the selective
      modification of the environment to render a particular anopheline of no
      importance as a vector in a particular situation. The lack of progress along
      these lines in India at that time is contrasted with that in south-east Asia. The
      extension of species sanitation and related concepts to other geographical areas 
      and to other vector-borne disease situations is outlined.

TI  - An experiment that failed: malaria control at Mian Mir.
PG  - 107-20
AB  - With the discovery of the role of the Anopheles mosquito in the transmission of
      malaria came the goal of mosquito control as a public health measure. One of the 
      early experiments (1902-1909) in mosquito control was conducted at the military
      cantonment at Mian Mir, near Lahore in present-day Pakistan. The experiment
      attached much attention and comment, especially from Ronald Ross who argued that 
      it had been badly planned and inadequately funded. Mian Mir certainly
      demonstrated that mosquito eradication was difficult to achieve and unlikely to
      be inexpensive, and is said to have influenced subsequent malaria programmes in
      India and elsewhere.

PG  - 116-9
AB  - Studies were undertaken to assess the role of some indigenous fish of Haryana
      state for the biological control of mosquitoes. Total of 28 fish species were
      encountered. Only six fresh water fish species Puntius ticto, Colisa fasciata,
      Aplocheilus panchax, Rasbora daniconius, Chanda nama, and Esomus danricus species
      possessed good feeding potential on mosquito larvae. The small size, well
      developed eyes and position of the mouth seem to be probably the important
      factors helping their voracity on mosquito larvae. These fish are either surface,
      subsurface or column feeders.

TI  - Biology of malaria vectors in central Gujarat.
PG  - 65-76
AB  - Biology of malaria vectors were studied in Kheda district of central Gujarat in
      order to understand the vector behaviour in the wake of ecological changes.
      Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi were mainly endophilic whereas An.
      fluviatilis exhibited marked exophily. All the three vectors were predominantly
      zoophilic. Peak biting activity period of An. culicifacies varied with season
      though biting continued in varying magnitudes throughout the night. An. stephensi
      and An. fluviatilis were arhythmic in their biting activity. Survival of all the 
      three vectors was maximum during cold season owing to longer gonotrophic cycle
      which also yielded higher estimates for expected infective life. Instability of
      malaria in this area was probably due to low estimates of expected infective life
      for the three vectors. A wide range of breeding habitat preferences by An.
      culicifacies was observed whereas An. fluviatilis and An. stephensi showed
      restricted distribution.

TI  - Field trial of esbiothrin-impregnated rope in Ramgarh village, Dadri PHC,
      District Ghaziabad (U.P.).
PG  - 57-64
AB  - A village-scale field trial was carried out to assess the operational feasibility
      and efficacy of smouldering 250 ppm esbiothrin-impregnated rope in repelling
      mosquitoes and its impact on transmission of malaria. Entomological monitoring
      revealed that smoke from smouldering rope resulted in 67.2-97.9% reduction of An.
      culicifacies densities in human and mixed dwellings. The reduction was obviously 
      due to diversion of An. culicifacies population to cattlesheds where ropes were
      not burnt. The impact was more pronounced when indoor mosquito landing rate on
      human bait was compared with that of experimental and control areas. This was
      also reflected in reduced anthropophilic index and curtailment of malaria
      transmission in experimental area.

TI  - Correlation of malaria endemicity with An. culicifacies sibling species
      composition and malaria antibody profile in district Allahabad (U.P.).
PG  - 48-56
AB  - Entomological, parasitological and serological surveys were conducted between
      October 1989 and November 1990 in 27 villages (population 33,250) belonging to
      three topographically different areas of district Allahabad, viz. Gangapar, Doaba
      and Yamunapar. A good correlation existed in all the three areas between malaria 
      incidence vis-a-vis An. culicifacies sibling species composition and malaria
      antibodies titre in the populations. In Gangapar and Doaba villages, An.
      culicifacies densities were low and the proportions of vector species A and C
      were much less than that of species B, the non-vector species. Low endemicity of 
      malaria was supported by low antibody titres observed in the population. In
      contrast, in Yamunapar villages An. culicifacies densities were high, species A
      and C together were almost equal to species B, and malaria incidence as well as
      antibody titre were high. Based on these observations, district Allahabad, Uttar 
      Pradesh, could be divided into two zones, low malaria transmission zone--Gangapar
      and Doaba areas and high malaria transmission zone--Yamunapar area.

AB  - Toxicity of certain mosquitocidal compounds (both larvicides and adulticides) to 
      the larvivorous fish Poecilia reticulata was determined in the laboratory. Among 
      the various chemical insecticides tested, the synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin
      was most toxic to fish (LC50 = 0.016 ppm), while the organophosphorus insecticide
      abate was least toxic (LC50 = 34 ppm). The bioinsecticides Spherix (Bacillus
      sphaericus) and Bactoculicide (Bacillus thuringiensis H-14) showed highest safety
      for the fish (LC50 > 1000 mg/litre). Integrated use of larvivorous fish and
      bioinsecticide in vector control has been suggested.

TI  - Personal protection from mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) by burning neem oil in
      kerosene.
PG  - 505-7
AB  - The repellent action of neem oil (extracted from the seeds of Azadirachta indica 
      A. Juss) was evaluated on mosquitoes at two villages near Delhi, India. Kerosene 
      lamps containing neem oil were burned in the living rooms, and mosquitoes resting
      walls or attracted to human bait were collected inside rooms from 1800 to 0600 h.
      Neem oil (0.01-1%) mixed in kerosene reduced biting of human volunteers and
      catches of mosquitoes resting on walls in the rooms. Protection was more
      pronounced against Anopheles than against Culex. A 1% neem oil-kerosene mixture
      may provide economical personal protection from mosquito bites.

TI  - A laboratory study on the life cycle and feeding behaviour of Arrenurus madaraszi
      (Acari: Arrenuridae) parasitizing Anopheles mosquitoes.
PG  - 169-74
AB  - Although mosquitoes of several genera were collected from one locality in
      Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala State, India, only Anopheles spp. carried larval
      Arrenurus madaraszi; 21.5% of the An. hyrcanus and 19.0% of the An. vagus were
      infested. However, the whole life cycle of Arr. madaraszi could be replicated in 
      the laboratory using Aedes albopictus, Ae. vittatus or Armigeres subalbatus as
      foster hosts. The host specificity observed in the field is therefore ecological,
      not physiological. In the laboratory, the nymphs and adult mites were free-living
      and when offered ostracods, copepods and larvae of Ae. albopictus, Ae. vittatus, 
      An. hyrcanus, An. vagus and Arm. subalbatus as food, they showed a preference for
      first instar mosquito larvae, particularly those of Ae. albopictus.

      calculated to be 43 and 58 ppm respectively. The second instar larvae were more
      susceptible than the fourth instar larvae. The extract did not affect the larval 
      developmental period. The growth index of treated mosquitoes was significant in
      comparison with that of the control and untreated sets (p < 0.01). Treatment with
      the extract had a significant effect on the mortality and reduction in the adult 
      emergence of the vector.

      deltamethrin was effective in killing mosquitoes which penetrated the netting in 
      search of an animal host.

      James, 1902, the major malaria vector in the endemic belt of Koraput District,
      Orissa, India.
PG  - 196-200
AB  - The population growth of Anopheles fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, was
      studied in the hill tracts of Koraput district. Immature duration ranged from 11 
      to 14 days (mean = 12.42 +/- 0.99) in rainy and 12 to 17 days (mean = 14.78 +/-
      1.64) in cold season. The probability of immature survival through different
      developmental stages was maximal in ponds. Daily survival rate of adults
      fluctuated between 0.55 and 0.92. The net reproductive rate (Ro) was estimated to
      be 3.0200 for cold and 0.6486 for rainy season. The mean generation time (T) was 
      slightly longer in cold season (22.32 days) than rainy season (21.24 days). The
      intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) and consequently the finite rate of
      increase (lambda) were estimated for cold and rainy seasons. Population growth
      based on adult resting density was also assessed for different seasons.

TI  - Observations on nocturnal activity and man biting habits of malaria vectors,
      Anopheles fluviatilis, An. annularis and An. culicifacies in the hill tracts of
      Koraput District, Orissa, India.
PG  - 187-95
AB  - Biting and feeding behavior of malaria vectors were studied in nine villages (5
      from Jeypore zone and 4 from Malkangiri zone) of Koraput District. Man biting
      catches comprised of 16 anopheline species including the incriminated vectors of 
      this area: An. fluviatilis, An. annularis and An. culicifacies. An. fluviatilis
      was predominant and biting of this species recorded indoors throughout the year
      in both the zones. The period, during which the biting activity peaked, was
      different between the two zones and consequently the time of peak transmission
      was also different between the zones. The biting activity was at its peak between
      21.00 and 03.00 hours in both the zones. However, in cold season the biting
      activity peaked in the first quarter of the night in Jeypore zone. The
      anthropophilic index (AI) of An. fluviatilis was 26.2% in Jeypore and 83.7% in
      Malkangiri and of An. culicifacies the AI was 0.4% in Jeypore and 7% in
      Malkangiri. Analysis of gonotrophic stages of night resting females indicated
      that in Jeypore zone, the majority of An. fluviatilis female left indoors for
      outdoor resting before the completion of gonotrophic cycle, but in Malkangiri,
      the females remained indoors till the end of the gonotrophic cycle. The presence 
      of full-fed females in night resting catches in Jeypore village further suggested
      that the females do not leave the house immediately after taking blood meal but
      rest for some time.

      programme.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - The impact of a 5-year vector control programme on transmission of bancroftian
      filariasis and microfilaraemia levels in the human population was examined in
      Pondicherry, South India. The programme reduced and maintained the transmission
      of Wuchereria bancrofti at appreciably low levels in many localities of
      Pondicherry town, but its impact on overall microfilaraemia prevalence was only
      limited. However, prevalence of infection was reduced drastically in children
      born after establishment of the programme and only 18% of the number expected
      without vector control were found infected. No new infections were found in
      localities with less transmission intensity. It is proposed that a Transmission
      Intensity Index of 0.50 and Annual Transmission Potential of less than the 96-105
      range are permissible levels of transmission, and below these levels no new
      infections may occur. The required duration of vector control to eliminate
      Culex-borne filariasis foci is estimated to be 11-12 years, slightly longer than 
      that required to eradicate anopheline-borne filariasis.

AB  - Anopheles subpictus Grassi is shown to comprise four reproductively distinct
      species, designated A, B, C and D, occurring sympatrically in villages of
      Pondicherry, southeast India. Adult females were reared individually from wild
      larvae and examined for their morphological and chromosomal characters.
      Paracentric fixed inversions on the X-chromosome serve to distinguish the species
      cytogenetically, with no inversion heterozygotes (i.e. no interspecific hybrids) 
      among totals of 717 species A (X+a, +b), 1863 species B (Xa, b), 869 species C
      (Xa, +b) and 1365 species D (X+a, b) identified. Morphologically, diagnostic
      characters for each of the four species are seen in the egg float ridge number,
      larval mesothoracic seta 4, pupal seta 7-I and the palpi of female adults.
      Species A, C and D immatures inhabit freshwater, whereas the malaria vector
      species B breeds in saltwater and was found only in coastal villages.

TI  - Insecticide resistance issues in vector-borne disease control.
PG  - 21-34
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are an increasing cause of death and suffering worldwide.
      Efforts to control these diseases have been focused on the use of chemical
      pesticides, but arthropod resistance (whether physiological, biochemical, or
      behavioral) to pesticides is now an immense practical problem. The
      pharmacokinetic interactions of pesticides with arthropods, mechanisms of
      resistance, and the strengths and shortcomings of different resistance test
      methods are briefly reviewed. Using malaria control as an example, the
      differences between the efficacy of insecticide-sprayed houses in reducing
      malaria transmission, and the actual effect of such treatments on vectors are
      discussed. Reduced malaria transmission as a result of spraying house walls
      occurs through some combination of killing vectors that land on sprayed walls
      (insecticidal effect) and by preventing vectors from entering or remaining inside
      long enough to bite (behavioral effects). Both insecticidal and behavioral
      effects of insecticides are important, but the relative importance of one versus 
      the other is controversial. Field studies in Africa, India, Brazil, and Mexico
      provide persuasive evidence for strong behavioral avoidance of DDT by the primary
      vector species. This avoidance behavior, exhibited when malaria vectors avoid
      insecticides by not entering or by rapidly exiting sprayed houses, should raise
      serious questions about the overall value of current physiological and
      biochemical resistance tests. The continued efficacy of DDT in Africa, India,
      Brazil, and Mexico, where 69% of all reported cases of malaria occur and where
      vectors are physiologically resistant to DDT (excluding Brazil), serves as one
      indicator that repellency is very important in preventing indoor transmission of 
      malaria. This experience with DDT has implications for future control efforts
      because pyrethroids also stimulate avoidance behaviors in arthropods. Each
      chemical should be studied early (before broad-scale use) to define types of
      action against vector species by geographic area, especially for impregnated bed 
      net applications. The problems for vector control created by use of insecticides 
      in agriculture and the potential for management of resistance in both agriculture
      and vector-borne disease control are discussed.

PG  - 221-5
AB  - The oviposition pattern of Romanomermis iyengari (Nematoda: Mermithidae) in
      relation to the moisture level in the soil was studied by seeding postparasites
      into two sets of 12 cm soil columns. While one set of the soil column was allowed
      to dry over a period of 60 days, the other set was maintained at a constant level
      of 15-20% moisture throughout the soil column. In the soil column maintained at
      constant moisture level, the postparasites oviposited primarily in the upper 3 cm
      layer (80-97%). In the soil column which was allowed to dry the percentages of
      eggs laid in the upper 3 cm layer were 96, 24 and 6 respectively on D20, D30 and 
      D40 after seeding and the moisture levels on respective days were 12, 5 and 3%.
      On corresponding days the postparasites laid 1, 56 and 42% of the eggs in the
      lower most layer (9-12 cm) and the moisture levels were respectively 15, 10 and
      9%. The results indicate that the adult nematodes migrated towards the bottom
      layer of the soil and laid eggs as the moisture of the upper layers decreased.

TI  - Evaluation of organophosphorus and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides against six 
      vector mosquitoe species.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - Three organophosphorus compounds- malathion, folithion and temephos- and two
      synthetic pyrethroids- alphamethrin and deltamethrin- were used for monitoring
      the susceptibility status of larvae and adults of six vector mosquito species:
      Culex quinquefasciatus (Filariasis) and Aedes albopictus (Dengue) (both
      laboratory and field strains); laboratory strains of Aedes aegypti (Dengue),
      Anopheles stephensi and Anopheles culicifacies (Malaria), and Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus (Japanese encephalitis) in India. From the LC50 values obtained
      for these insecticides, it was found that all mosquito species including the
      field strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus were highly susceptible 
      Except for Cx. quinquefasciatus (field strain) against malathion, 100% mortality 
      was observed at the discriminating dosages recommended by World Health
      Organization. The residual effect of alphamethrin, deltamethrin, malathion and
      folithion at 25 mg (ai)/m2 on different surfaces against six species of vector
      mosquitoes showed that alphamethrin was the most effective on all four treated
      surfaces (mud, plywood, cement and thatch). Nevertheless, residual efficacy
      lasted longer on thatch than on the other surfaces. Therefore, synthetic
      pyrethroids such as alphamethrin can be effectively employed in integrated vector
      control operations.

PG  - 13-21
AB  - alpha-Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) expression during the complete
      development and aging of Anopheles stephensi has been studied by electrophoretic 
      and spectrophotometric techniques. Single gene locus seems to govern the
      developmental expression of three isozymes numbered from GPDH-1 to GPDH-3 in
      order of decreasing mobility. GPDH-3 was present in all the stages of
      development. GPDH-1 disappeared during senescence. GPDH-2, the band of
      intermediate mobility, was adult specific. GPDH-1 has been indicated to be more
      suitable for energy metabolism and GPDH-3 for lipid biosynthesis. Three
      codominant alleles control the four electrophoretic variants revealed in the
      laboratory strain. Quantitatively, the activity of GPDH continuously increased
      during development and showed its peak on day-4 adults of both sexes. However,
      the activity decreased during senescence. Tissue and sex specific differences in 
      isozymes pattern have also been analysed. Changes in isozymes and specific
      activity have been correlated with the various physiological and morphological
      events occurring during development.

TI  - Lambdacyhalothrin treated bed nets as an alternative method of malaria control in
      tribal villages of Koraput District, Orissa State, India.
PG  - 513-21
AB  - A village scale trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of bed-nets
      impregnated with lambdacyhalothrin, at the dose of 0.025 g/m2, in reducing
      malaria transmission in villages of Koraput District of Orissa, India, inhabited 
      by tribals. The nets were distributed before peak transmission season. There was 
      an overall decline in the parasite rate in all the age groups, six months after
      the supply of impregnated nets while the same increased in control village and in
      a village where untreated nets were supplied. The vector densities (resting and
      man landing) were lower in the treated village as compared to untreated and
      control villages throughout the study period. The reduction in the parasite rate 
      was consistent when the reimpregnation was done at six monthly interval and the
      same tend to increase when the gap between the two impregnations was increased to
      one year. Though malaria incidence was reduced, transmission was not completely
      interrupted during the study period, due to outdoor transmission. The
      insecticidal effect of bednets was retained upto six months. Washing of bednets
      by the community did not affect the efficacy. The acceptance and usage was better
      with impregnated nets as compared to ordinary nets.

TI  - Studies on dispersal of malaria vectors in a hilly tract of Koraput District,
      Orissa State, India.
PG  - 508-12
AB  - Dispersal of malaria vectors was studied in a hilltop village in Koraput, a
      highly malarious district of Orissa. Immatures from terraced stream beds and
      day-time resting adults from artificially dug pit shelters, distributed
      centrifugally at different distances from the village were sampled. Breeding of
      Anopheles fluviatilis, An. annularis and An. culicifacies was found up to a
      distance of 1,700 m. Immature density of An. fluviatilis and An. culicifacies
      showed a negative correlation with the distance, but they were not statistically 
      significant. The maximum distance at which An. fluviatilis adult females
      collected was 1,500 m. A significantly negative correlation was observed between 
      An. fluviatilis resting females and distance. An. culicifacies adults were
      collected in low numbers even in the nearest pit shelters. No An. annularis was
      recorded from the pit shelters. The present record on the dispersal range of An. 
      fluviatilis is estimated to be higher than that reported elswhere in India.

TI  - Use of kerosene lamp containing synthetic pyrethroids to repel mosquitoes.
PG  - 169-76
AB  - An indigenous and appropriate method of personal protection was developed and
      tested in rural areas. It consists of an ordinary kerosene lamp made of tin with 
      a regulator to adjust the wick. Different concentrations of esbiothrin, a
      synthetic pyrethroid, were mixed in kerosene and allowed to burn in living rooms 
      and cattlesheds from dusk to dawn to observe hourly entry of mosquitoes. The tin 
      lamp (100 ml capacity) without chimney provided the most efficient protection
      from mosquito bites. The protection varied from 84.2 +/- 8.2 to 97.8 +/- 2.8.
      Maximum protection was observed against An. culicifacies. Esbiothrin kerosene
      lamp (0.01%) lighted in living room provided 99.7% protection to exposed human
      baits seated at a distance of 1 m from the lamp. The technique is simple,
      cost-effective and does not require electricity and can be used both for
      illumination and repelling mosquitoes in remote and inaccesible areas.

AB  - Studies on adult densities, vector incrimination and breeding habitats of An.
      culicifacies and An. stephensi were carried out during June 1984 to May 1986 in
      three different ecological areas of urban Delhi. Both An. culicifacies and An.
      stephensi prevailed throughout the year in peri-urban areas with higher densities
      during the post-monsoon months. In south and northwest areas, low densities of
      these vector species were recorded. An. culicifacies was found naturally infected
      with sporozoites in peri-urban and south areas, whereas An. stephensi showed
      gland infection in south areas only. Out of 827 blood smears collected, 302 were 
      positive for malaria parasites. Of the positives, P. vivax formed 48.3% and P.
      falciparum 51.7%. Peri-urban areas showed a higher number of malaria cases than
      south and northwest areas.

      species collected in Jairampur, Arunachal Pradesh, show that P. falciparum
      contributed 27.59% of the total positive cases, most of these being recorded
      during July to September. Of the twelve anopheline species recorded, Anopheles
      maculatus was the most predominant comprising 54.32% of the total collection.
      Other common species were An. peditaeniatus, An. philippinensis and An. kochi in 
      order of decreasing proportion. An. dirus, the known vector, was collected in the
      whole-night human bait catches (indoor) but in low numbers. An. philippinensis is
      implicated as another potential vector, and changes in anopheline/vector fauna
      are attributed to ecological succession.

AB  - A survey was carried out during 1989-91 to study the prevalence and distribution 
      of anopheline mosquitoes in 12 villages located in all the 4 tehsils of Bikaner
      district. Six species, viz. Anopheles subpictus (34.7%), An. stephensi (33.3%),
      An. culicifacies (18.0%), An. annularis (12.1%), An. pulcherrimus (1.1%) and An. 
      barbirostris (0.8%), were collected. An. stephensi was present throughout the
      year and the other species were present during the monsoon and post-monsoon
      periods. During the peak winter period (Dec-Jan) only An. stephensi was present
      and in low density. An. culicifacies made its appearance only during the spring
      season and continued up to the middle of November. An. subpictus, An.
      pulcherrimus, An. barbirostris and An. annularis were found only during the
      monsoon and post-monsoon periods. An. subpictus was the most abundant species
      during the monsoon, and so was An. stephensi during the spring season in indoor
      habitats.

TI  - Seasonality of indoor resting mosquitoes in a broken-forest ecosystem of
      north-western Orissa.
PG  - 145-54
AB  - The seasonal prevalence and indoor resting habits of mosquitoes in a
      broken-forest ecosystem of Orissa, which is known to be endemic for malaria and
      bancroftian filariasis, have been studied. A total of 15 anopheline spp., 9 Culex
      spp. and one each of Aedes, Armigeres and Mansonia, were collected. Major species
      with perennial occurrence were Anopheles culicifacies, An. subpictus, An.
      annularis, An. vagus, An. pallidus, An. nigerrimus, Culex quinquefasciatus and
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. These species rested more in cattlesheds than in human
      dwellings, except Cx. quinquefasciatus which was abundant in human dwellings. The
      prevalence and indoor resting pattern of different species in relation to seasons
      and other factors were also investigated.

TI  - Dengue in Gujarat state, India during 1988 & 1989.
PG  - 135-44
AB  - Following the reports of epidemics of febrile illness from several rural and
      urban areas of Gujarat state (India) in 1988, epidemiological investigations were
      carried out and dengue (DEN) virus activity was demonstrated in large cities such
      as Surat and Rajkot as well as several villages in Sabarkantha district. Two
      strains of dengue type-2 each were isolated from human sera from Surat city and a
      village in Sabarkantha district. Six strains of dengue virus were isolated from
      Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected at Chotasan village, two of which were
      confirmed as DEN type-2. Of the 560 patients' sera tested from different areas
      (including villages and townships), 122 showed evidence of dengue infection and
      another 236 showed a broader reaction with flaviviruses. Entomological
      investigations showed a widespread distribution of Ae. aegypti both in urban and 
      rural areas. In the household conditions this mosquito was found to breed
      predominantly in containers with non-potable water. Amongst these, cement
      containers manufactured in towns and distributed to the villages seem to play an 
      important role in the spread of this species. In non-residential areas prolific
      breeding of Ae. aegypti was observed in automobile tyre dumps, and varied types
      of scrap, in towns and villages. Distribution and relative prevalence of the
      species were studied in 46 towns and villages, covering the spectrum of
      rural-urban-continuum. These studies provide an indication regarding the
      mechanism of the spread of DEN virus through peoples' movement, transport, the
      process of urbanisation etc.

PG  - 81-9
AB  - Spherix, a powder formulation of Bacillus sphaericus strain B-101, serotype H5a
      5b, was evaluated against larvae of Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus in both the laboratory and field. In laboratory tests the
      formulation @ 0.1 g/sq m produced 100% mortality against larvae of both mosquito 
      species at room temperature (28-32 degrees C). The larvicidal activity of Spherix
      against An. stephensi @ 0.5 g/sq m persisted for over 12 weeks under laboratory
      conditions. Field evaluation of Spherix @ 0.25-2.0 g/sq m produced 95-100%
      reduction in the larval density of both An. stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      within 48 h in different habitats, and the larvicidal activity persisted for 2-4 
      weeks in water habitats.

TI  - Insecticide susceptibility status of Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus 
      and Aedes aegypti in Panaji, Goa.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - Adult and larval insecticidal tests conducted in Panaji, Goa, revealed that
      adults of An. stephensi were resistant to DDT (4.0%), dieldrin (0.4%) and
      malathion (5.0%). The larvae of An. stephensi were also resistant to DDT (2.5
      mg/l) and malathion (3.125 mg/l). Cx. quinquefasciatus adults were resistant to
      DDT, dieldrin, malathion and fenitrothion (1.0%), and larvae were highly
      resistant to DDT but showed low resistance to malathion and fenitrothion (0.125
      mg/I). Adults of Ae. aegypti were resistant to DDT and dieldrin and the larvae
      showed resistance to DDT but good susceptibility to fenitrothion and complete
      susceptibility to malathion. The triple resistance of An. stephensi to DDT,
      dieldrin and malathion is intriguing as malathion has never been used in the
      health sector in Goa. A very limited use of malathion was done in the
      agricultural sector in Chandor area, which is 50 km away from the study area.

AB  - Studies on mosquito breeding and its control through Gambusia affinis in nursery 
      and paddy fields after transplantation of seedlings were carried out during June 
      to October 1991 in about 10 ha rice field area. Six anopheline species, viz. An. 
      culicifacies, An. annularis, An. subpictus, An. nigerrimus, An. barbirostris and 
      An. aconitus, and four culicine species, viz. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx.
      bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Aedes sp. could be identified. These 
      were found breeding in rice fields with fluctuations in their percentage
      composition, exhibiting species succession in different months. G. affinis
      survived well in submerged rice fields and provided 87.8% mosquito larval
      control. In rice fields which exhibited intermittent drying up leading to
      formation of pools, puddles etc., moderate larval control was achieved. However, 
      in nursery rice fields, this method was not applicable. Mosquito larval control
      through larvivorous fish in rice fields can be achieved but the method has
      limitations.

AB  - A longitudinal study on malaria transmission was conducted from January 1983 to
      December 1988 in two villages of Dimapur PHC in Nagaland. A diverse anopheline
      fauna comprising of 23 species was identified including three species viz. An.
      aitkeni, An. bengalensis and An. insulaeflorum which were observed in larval
      stages only. An. vagus was the predominant species followed by An.
      philippinensis, An. culicifacies and An. minimus. An. minimus though maintained
      relatively high density throughout the year manifested two peaks in June and
      October. An. fluviatilis and An. dirus though found in relatively low density
      their seasonal prevalence was suggestive of a post-monsoon and monsoon species
      respectively.

AB  - Alkaloids isolated from Annona squamosa have shown larvicidal growth-regulating
      and chemosterilant activities against Anopheles stephensi at concentrations of 50
      to 200 ppm. Adults exposed as larvae to different treatments showed reduced
      fecundity and fertility in females. Mortality in the larvae, pupae and adults
      produced about a 52-92% decrease in the laboratory experiment. The total
      developmental period was slightly reduced from the control. Treatment with the
      alkaloids had a significant effect on the mortality, emergence and reproductive
      physiology of An. stephensi.

      island populations.
PG  - 27-31
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato collected from Rameshwaram island, Tamil Nadu
      state, India was identified as species B based on the diagnostic inversion
      karyotype Xab 2g1+h1 as observed in polytene chromosomes. Among male mitotic
      karyotypes made from larval neurogonial cells, two types were observed: one with 
      an acrocentric Y-chromosome and the other with a sub-metacentric Y-chromosome,
      both had sub-metacentric X and metacentric autosomes. The Rameshwaram population 
      is identical to species B in its genetic relationship with species A and C as
      determined by experimental hybridizations (sterile and fertile male hybrids,
      respectively).

TI  - Effect of temperature on toxicity of two bioinsecticides spherix (Bacillus
      sphaericus) and bactoculicide (Bacillus thuringiensis) against larvae of four
      vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - Two bioinsecticide preparations, viz. Spherix (Bacillus sphaericus) and
      Bactoculicide (Bacillus thuringiensis H-14), were tested in the laboratory
      against larvae of Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi, Culex
      quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti at different temperatures. The LCs50 of
      Spherix against III instar larvae of these species at 27 +/- 2 degrees C were
      2.0, 0.19, 0.05 and > 40 mg/litre, respectively and those of Bactoculicide were
      0.32, 0.16, 0.06 and 0.03 mg/litre, respectively. The toxicity of two
      bioinsecticides, especially Spherix, varied to a great extent when the tests were
      repeated at 21 +/- 2 degrees C and 31 +/- 2 degrees C. At 21 +/- 2 degrees C,
      Spherix was almost non-toxic against larvae of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi
      (LC50 > 10 mg/l) but at 31 +/- 2 degrees C the bioinsecticide was highly toxic
      against An. culicifacies (LC50 = 0.48 mg/litre) and An. stephensi (LC50 = 0.04
      mg/litre). A similar effect of the temperature was also observed with
      Bactoculicide.

TI  - Present perspectives of malaria transmission in Boko area of Assam.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - A longitudinal study on malaria transmission was conducted from January 1984 to
      December 1988 in three villages in Boko PHC of Assam, where indoor residual DDT
      spray was withdrawn during the period of study. Anopheline fauna comprising of 19
      species was identified and their seasonal density estimated. Anopheles
      philippinensis was the predominant species followed by An. minimus. The principal
      role of An. minimus in the transmission of malaria and predilection for indoor
      resting in this area was clearly evident. Though An. dirus and An. fluviatilis
      were found in low density, sporozoite infection was detected in them along with
      An. minimus. The high malaria incidence predominantly with Plasmodium falciparum 
      was closely related to sporozoite infection in the vectors and their densities.
      The biting cycle of An. minimus was maximum in the first half of the night.

AB  - An extensive fish fauna survey was carried out in Sundargarh, a malaria-endemic
      district in Orissa, during 1988 to 1990 to identify and evaluate the indigenous
      larvivorous fishes for mosquito control. In all, 57 species belonging to 19
      families under 6 orders were found in the local water bodies. On laboratory
      evaluation against anopheline and culicine larvae, six potential larvivorous
      fishes, viz. Aplocheilus panchax, Oryzias melastigma, Oreochromis mossambicus,
      Gambusia affinis, Danio (B.) rerio and Esomus danricus were selected. Feasibility
      of mass multiplication of these fishes in village ponds for operational use is
      being studied.

      impact of pirimiphos-methyl (25 per cent Wp) on malaria vectors in Tirap district
      of Arunachal Pradesh showed that a low density (0.0 to 0.02 PMH) of Anopheles
      dirus was maintained in the areas sprayed with the insecticide at the dosages of 
      1 and 2 g/m2 from 1981 to 1984. The post-spray data (1985 to 1988) showed a
      reduction of 62.5 to 62.8 per cent in SPR, 55.6 to 64.7 per cent in SRF and 72.3 
      to 75.5 per cent decline in API as compared to baseline data of 1980 in areas
      sprayed with pirimiphos methyl.

AB  - Different Electric-Mat-Device (EMD) vaporizers and bioallethrin impregnated mats 
      were evaluated for the knockdown and mortality in the adults of Culex

      80-100 was recorded throughout the test period of 11 hours. However, the
      percentage mortality observed was not appreciable in all types of EMD vaporizers.
      Device "A" was found to be effective only against Ae. aegypti. Devices "C" and
      "D" showed moderate effects against An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti. Only device
      "B" was found to give appreciable mortality in all three vector mosquito species 
      compared to other devices which may be attributed to the uniform release rate (2 
      mg/hour) of bioallethrin.

TI  - Anopheline fauna of parts of Tirap district, Arunachal Pradesh with reference to 
      malaria transmission.
PG  - 245-9
AB  - In a survey on the anopheline fauna in highly malaria endemic areas of the Tirap 
      district of Arunachal Pradesh, 7476 anophelines belonging to 17 species were
      collected, including seven species of anophelines which are recognized malaria
      vectors in India. Anopheles tessellatus and A. jamesii were recorded for the
      first time in this area. The parasitological survey revealed that the area was
      endemic for malaria particularly P. falciparum, the slide positivity rate and
      slide falciparum rate being 25.63 and 19.21 per cent respectively. On dissection 
      of 10 anopheles species, malarial infection was detected in two viz., A. minimus 
      and A. dirus.

TI  - Factors affecting transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti by anopheline mosquitoes. 
      4. Facilitation, limitation, proportionality and their epidemiological
      significance.
PG  - 523-30
AB  - Quantitative understanding of the transmission dynamics of lymphatic filarial
      parasites is essential for the rational planning of control strategies. One of
      the most important determinants of transmission dynamics is the relationship
      between parasite yield, the success rate of ingested microfilariae (mf) becoming 
      infective larvae in a mosquito vector, and mf density in the source of the human 
      blood meal. Three types of relationship have been recognized in human
      filaria/mosquito couples--limitation, facilitation and proportionality;
      facilitation has hitherto been observed only in the couple Wuchereria
      bancrofti/Anopheles gambiae in Burkina Faso, in experimental studies on a high
      density mf carrier. The present paper demonstrates facilitation in W.
      bancrofti/An. gambiae and W. bancrofti/An. arabiensis in lower mf density
      carriers in The Gambia and Tanzania, and in W. bancrofti/An. funestus in
      Tanzania. Facilitation was not found in An. melas in The Gambia nor in An. merus 
      in Tanzania. Analysis of published data shows limitation at low level mf
      densities in W. bancrofti/Culex quinquefasciatus in Sri Lanka, and in the same
      couple in India. Limitation also occurs in Brugia malayi/Aedes togoi in
      experimental cats; proportionality occurs in B. malayi/Mansonia bonneae in
      Malaysia. The epidemiological significance of these host/parasite relationships
      is discussed, and supporting evidence for its validity is presented from the
      published results of large-scale control programmes.

      DPE-28 on the development of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus have been evaluated. OMS 3007, OMS 3019, DPE-28 and Neporex show
      species specific related activities, while methoprene and aphid extracts do not
      show such activity against these mosquito species. Treatment of mosquito eggs
      with an EC50 dose of these compounds caused mortality while an EC90 dose
      completely ceased adult emergence. The fecundity and fertility rates of
      mosquitoes emerged shows significant reduction (P less than 0.001) when treated
      with EC50 doses of all the compounds.

      starved for 24 hours, cannibalized eggs of their own kind or preyed upon the eggs
      of other species (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi) present on the surface
      of water in small containers. Second and third instars consumed eggs faster than 
      first and fourth instars. The first instar consumed larvae of its own kind faster
      than the other instars, in the absence of other prey. However, when prey larvae
      were provided, there was a significant fall in the rate of cannibalism.

AB  - Studies on seasonal prevalence and succession of mosquitoes in rice fields,
      revealed the dominance of Anopheles culicifacies and An. subpictus in newly
      transplanted fields during early months of rice cultivation, which was later
      replaced by the species like An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. nigerrimus and 
      An. tessellatus with the growth in plant height. Among culicines, except Cx.
      quinquefasciatus other species were prevalent during growing and later stages of 
      the rice crop. Larval density was found inversely proportional to the height of
      plants, whereas species diversity maximized during growing phase due to equitable
      number of specimen among species.

PG  - 161-5
AB  - The laboratory strain of Anopheles stephensi, a well-known urban malaria vector, 
      was selected with permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid at LD90 level up to five
      generations. The selection resulted in the development of resistance in F5
      generation to the tune of 13-fold to permethrin and cross-resistance to the tune 
      of 7-fold to cypermethrin, 9-fold to alphamethrin, and 10-fold to deltamethrin.
      The development of cross-resistance to 4% DDT was also noticed. The
      susceptibility status against 5% malathion was maintained throughout the five
      generations. The synergistic effect of piperonyl butoxide with permethrin did not
      overcome the development of resistance. The development of resistance showed a
      significant relationship between hatchability and different generations.

OAB - PIP: Malaria endemic countries in the southeast Asia region include Bangladesh,
      Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
      Population movement and rapid urbanization, both largely caused by unemployment, 
      and environmental deterioration change the malaria pattern. They also increase
      the incidence of drug-resistant malaria, especially resistance to
      4-aminoquinolines. In India, Plasmodium falciparum is linked to the density and
      distribution of tribals, and, in southern Thailand, rubber tappers have the
      highest malaria incidence rate (46.29%). Since the population is young and the
      young are highly sensitive to malaria infection, the region has low community
      immunity. High malaria priority areas are forests, forested hills, forest fringe 
      areas, developmental project sites, and border areas. High risk groups include
      infants, young children, pregnant women, and mobile population groups. Malaria
      incidence is between 2.5-2.8 million cases, and the slide positivity rate is
      about 3%. P. falciparum constitutes 40% for all malaria cases. In 1988 in India, 
      there were 222 malaria deaths. Malaria is the 7th most common cause of death in
      Thailand. 3 of the 19 Anopheline species are resistant to at least 1 insecticide,
      particularly DDT. Posteradication epidemics surfaced in the mid-1970s. Malaria
      control programs tend to use the primary health care and integration approach to 
      malaria control. Antiparasite measures range from a single-dose of an
      antimalarial to mass drug administration. Residual spraying continues to be the
      main strategy of vector control. Some other vector control measures are fish
      feeding on mosquito larvae, insecticide impregnated mosquito nets, and
      repellents. Control programs also have health education activities. India
      allocates the highest percentage of its total health budget to malaria control
      (21.54%). Few malariology training programs exist in the region. Slowly processed
      surveillance data limit the countries' ability to forecast and to combat malaria 
      epidemics. Almost all control programs have a special research unit but
      capabilities are limited. Political commitment is needed to control malaria.

TI  - Critical appraisal of entomological data of Madhya Pradesh for 1991 and its
      relevance to the National Malaria Eradication Programme.
PG  - 97-108
AB  - Entomological data generated in five entomological zones, of Madhya Pradesh State
      during 1991 including, Bhopal, Bilaspur, Gwalior, Indore and Raipur were
      analyzed. The entomological parameters that were studied included per man hour
      (pmh) density, abdominal physiology and parity status. The inferences were
      related to i) resting behaviour (exophily/endophily) ii) duration of indoor
      resting period of mosquitoes iii) man-vector contact iv) efficacy of residual
      insecticide and v) vulnerability of the area to focal malaria outbreaks. The data
      chiefly pertains to the putative malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies in all the
      five zones under study. The studies have brought out that A. culicifacies,
      traditionally endophilic and endophagic, has demonstrated radical departure in
      its resting and feeding behaviour. In Gwalior zone the species shows high
      preference for exophily. In Bhopal and Indore zones there is differential resting
      behaviour with respect to season. The species shows, for most part of the year
      exophily but is also endophilic during post monsoon period. In Bilaspur zone the 
      species shows marked exophily and endophagy. Irrigation practices seem to have
      affected the mosquito population density patterns in these regions as brought out
      in Indore and Bilaspur zone, where high density pattern is observed between
      November and February. These findings have obvious implications in selecting the 
      appropriate intervention methods and the period of spray in areas where residual 
      spray is the method of choice for interruption of transmission.

      various physico-chemical factors throw light on the three significant points with
      regard to the population build up of Anopheles stephensi. Slightly alkaline pH is
      essential for higher population density, lower the salinity, higher the
      population density and higher amount of free ammonia in the water is accounted
      for the higher population density of A. stephensi.

TI  - Influence of short time exposure to an insect growth regulator, hexaflumuron, on 
      mortality and adult emergence of vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 275-83
AB  - Hexaflumuron, an insect growth regulator (IGR), was found to greatly affect the
      development of immatures and emergence of adults of three species of vector
      mosquitoes, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi, when
      larvae were subjected to short time exposure of < or = 1 h. This IGR could
      completely prevent adult emergence even at a minimum exposure time of 10 min at
      0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/l. On treatment, larval and pupal mortality as well as
      varying degrees of morphogenetic abnormalities were induced in immatures and
      adults of the three species. Four weeks of control achieved in a slow moving
      sullage canal breeding Culex quinquefasciatus indicates that this IGR can be of
      use in such breeding habitats.

PG  - 121-4
AB  - Longevity of the adults of three vector species, Culex quinquefasciatus,
      Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti was drastically reduced when they were
      exposed at larval and pupal stages to sublethal concentrations of an insect
      growth regulator hexaflumuron. When the three species were exposed to 0.05 mg/l
      at the pupal stage, males and females of Cx. quinquefasciatus suffered a more
      shortened life span than other species. Among the females whose feeding activity 
      was adversely affected by IGR treatment at the pupal stage, Ae. aegypti showed
      the minimum survival duration with LT50 of 2.74 days.

TI  - Differential selection of malathion resistance in Anopheles culicifacies A and B 
      (Diptera: Culicidae) in Haryana State, India.
PG  - 183-7
AB  - In November 1989, for the first time after the introduction of malathion spray in
      1982, increased densities of Anopheles culicifacies Giles s.l. were observed in
      Chhatera and Barota, two villages in Halalpur block in Sonepat District, Haryana 
      State, India. In bioassay tests against the diagnostic dose of malathion (5% for 
      1 h), 41-47% of mosquitoes survived. An culicifacies populations in this area
      comprise two sibling species, A and B. Differential malathion resistance was
      observed; in species A it was 2-9% and in species B 62-66%. Likewise, species A
      was found to be more susceptible to DDT than was species B. The possible use of
      DDT spray to delay the onset of malathion resistance is discussed.

TI  - Breeding habitats and their contribution to Anopheles stephensi in Panaji.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - A one-year longitudinal study conducted in 9 categories of breeding habitats in
      Panaji, Goa, showed that 1.1% of the 67,360 breeding sites contained Anopheles
      stephensi immatures and the overall positivity varied from 0.4 to 3.5% with a
      peak in June. The habitat-wise proportion of An. stephensi was: wells, 0-1.3%;
      fountains, 1.4-11.4%; masonry tanks, 0.8-6.1%; overhead tanks, 0.1-4.0%; curing
      water in construction sites, 0.6-9.0%; groundwater tanks, 0-1.4%; tyres, 0-8.9%; 
      barrels and tins, 0-5.4%; and intradomestic containers, 0-1.9%. An. stephensi was
      breeding along with An. subpictus, An. vagus, An. barbirostris, Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Cx. vishnui, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Ae. vittatus.

TI  - Epidemic of malaria in Barmer district (Thar desert) of Rajasthan during 1990.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Barmer district of Rajasthan in Thar desert and hitherto a hypoendemic area for
      malaria came in the grip of a severe malaria epidemic during 1990. The epidemic
      occurred as an aftermath of floods, preceded by normal rains during 1988 and 1989
      after a prolonged drought phase. The epidemic was spread over the whole district 
      including Barmer town. Annual Parasite Incidence (API) and Annual falciparum
      Incidence (AFI) for the district touched record figures of 17.20 and 5.83
      respectively while for the Barmer town they were 36.5 and 14.0 respectively. Out 
      of the eight PHCs, Baitu PHC was the worst affected where the two indices touched
      all-time high figures of 55.3 and 19.6 per cent respectively. A total of 122
      infants were reported positive for malaria, of which 103 were contributed by
      Baitu PHC alone. Eighty per cent infant positivity was spread over September and 
      November, indicating a high rate of transmission. A total of 47 deaths due to
      cerebral malaria were reported. However, in view of the high infectivity among
      infants and paediatric groups there was a strong possibility of deaths among
      these groups which could not be verified. Entomological findings revealed that a 
      sudden increase in An. culicifacies densities due to extensive breeding
      potential, as a sequel to floods, activated the transmission, which was
      maintained at a low level by An. stephensi, predominant in this desert region.
      Other factors which contributed to the intensity and extent of epidemic were the 
      return of drought-migrated population from malarious areas, low cattle density,
      malaria non-immune population, inadequate and poor spray coverage and delayed
      radical treatment. Insecticide adult susceptibility tests revealed a high degree 
      of resistance in An. stephensi against DDT and dieldrin.

TI  - Efficacy of diethylcarbamazine medicated salt in interrupting Brugia malayi
      transmission in hill tribe settlements in Kerala State.
PG  - 16-9
AB  - A filariasis survey carried out about eight years after achieving zero
      microfilaria (mf) rates following administration of diethylcarbamazine (DEC)
      medicated salt in the Kani hill tribe settlements in Quilon and
      Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala State revealed that there was no
      reappearance of Brugia malayi infection in the experimental areas. Mf rates were 
      maintained at zero level in the experimental villages, while in the control
      villages, 2.9 per cent mf positives were observed. Mansonia (Mansonioides)
      uniformis dissected did not reveal filarial infection. It is concluded that DEC
      medicated salt regime in the experimental areas of Kani hill tribe settlements
      has been successful in effectively interrupting B. malayi transmission. Pilot
      studies in other B. malayi endemic areas of India using DEC medicated salt regime
      with the objective of eliminating B. malayi transmission are advocated, since the
      parasite has a restricted distribution in India and is already showing a
      declining trend.

      Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The infectivity of gametocytes of Plasmodium berghei (NK 65) has been studied in 
      laboratory bred Anopheles stephensi. Mosquitoes were fed daily on infected male
      and female Mastomys natalensis and subsequent development of the oocysts was
      monitored in the midguts. Maximum number of oocysts were found in mosquitoes
      which were fed on infected female mastomys on D8 and in male mastomys on D7
      post-inoculation. During the next peak of gametocytaemia, very few oocysts
      developed. These findings suggest that gametocytes are maximally infective only
      during the first peak, later on their infectivity declines although having
      sufficient number of gametocytes in the circulation.

PG  - 249-53
AB  - Ethofenprox (Trebon), a new compound, was evaluated against three species of
      mosquito larvae in the laboratory. Larval LC50 values revealed that Culex
      quinquefasciatus was more susceptible than Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi. The
      residual toxicity of Trebon was studied against culicine larvae in the rice
      agroecosystem at rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 kg ai/ha. Effective control was
      obtained for even beyond five weeks at the larvicidal rate of 0.2 kg ai/ha.
      Trebon is not safe to nontarget aquatic organisms.

TI  - Infection rate and vectorial capacity of malaria vectors in Jeypore hill tract.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - The role of different anophelines in malaria transmission in two geoclimatic
      zones, viz., Jeypore and Malkangiri plateau of Koraput distt., which are endemic 
      for malaria, was studied. Out of 10,110 specimens belonging to 9 species
      collected and dissected over a period of 12 months by different methods in nine
      study villages, natural infection (sporozoites and oocysts) was detected in An.
      fluviatilis in both the zones. The sporozoite and oocyst rates were 0.28% and
      1.41% in Jeypore zone and 5.09% and 0.85% in Malkangiri zone, respectively.
      Sporozoites were also found in a single specimen of An. culicifacies in
      Malkangiri area. An. annularis was incriminated in an earlier study. The
      vectorial capacities of An. fluviatilis, An. culicifacies and An. annularis were 
      estimated for the three plasmodial species, viz., P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. 
      malariae in different seasons. The definitive role played by each species in
      transmission is discussed.

TI  - Gel diffusion analysis of Anopheles bloodmeals from 12 malarious study villages
      of Orissa State, India.
PG  - 595-603
AB  - In Orissa State, India, the double gel diffusion technique was used to analyze
      97,405 bloodmeals of all fed anophelines that were caught during standardized
      monthly surveys in 12 malarious study villages, from 1982 through 1988. Anopheles
      culicifacies contributed the highest number of smears from the 19 Anopheles
      species recovered. It was observed that a pronounced predilection to take mixed
      bloodmeals attenuates the vector potential of the species concerned.
      Consequently, prevalences based only upon "pure" (unmixed) primate bloodmeals
      provide the most accurate way to assess the intensity of feeding contact that
      actually occurs between a given species and man. By this method, the ranking
      order is Anopheles fluviatilis, An. culicifacies and An. annularis (N); a
      sequence which concurs with current knowledge on the vector status of malaria
      mosquitoes in Orissa.

TI  - Evaluation of a microgel droplet formulation of Bacillus sphaericus 1593 M
      (Biocide-S) for control of mosquito larvae in rice fields in southern India.
PG  - 556-9
AB  - A new microgel droplet formulation of Bacillus sphaericus 1593 M (Biocide-S) was 
      tested at 2 rates against culicine vectors of Japanese encephalitis and Anopheles
      subpictus. A single application just after transplantation of rice seedlings
      prevented the buildup of anopheline as well as culicine populations, and gave
      83-100% reduction of pupal density at the lower rate (2.2 kg/ha) and 87-100%
      reduction at the higher dosage (4.3 kg/ha) for at least 5 weeks. During the last 
      3 wk before harvest, density was naturally very low and the efficacy of the
      treatment could not be assessed. This formulation has a potential for control of 
      riceland mosquitoes, but a suitable delivery system is required before it can be 
      considered for practical control.

TI  - Etiologic significance of mosquito (Anopheles stephensi) in respiratory allergy
      in India.
PG  - 598-602
AB  - The etiologic significance of Anopheles stephensi, a common mosquito species in
      Delhi, in respiratory allergic disorders was investigated. Intradermal (ID) tests
      with the mosquito whole body extract (WBE) were performed on 247 patients with
      bronchial asthma and/or rhinitis and 50 healthy nonallergic volunteers. Of these 
      247 patients, 118 (47.8%) had positive (1+ to 4+) reactions including 72 (29.1%) 
      with markedly positive (2+ to 4+) ID reactions. We did not observe any 2+ to 4+
      skin reactions in normal healthy volunteers, giving evidence for the specificity 
      of markedly positive ID response. The skin test positivity was not influenced by 
      various clinical characteristics (age at onset, duration and type of disease, and
      family history) of patients included in the study. The specificity of positive ID
      response was further supported by the results of mosquito RAST with the sera of
      14 patients. Ten of the 12 sera (83%) from patients with positive ID response to 
      mosquito WBE were RAST positive. Sera from two patients with negative ID
      reactions were RAST negative. The bronchial provocation tests (BPTs) were
      uniformly negative in all five healthy volunteers and two patients showing
      negative ID responses to mosquito WBE, while the three patients showing 2+ to 4+ 
      responses gave positive BPTs. Our results suggest that mosquito-derived particles
      are important inhalant allergens in the etiology of IgE-mediated respiratory
      allergic disorders in India.

TI  - Tralomethrin (OMS-3048), a new synthetic pyrethroid against vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - Tralomethrin (OMS-3048) a synthetic pyrethroid, was tested for its insecticidal
      properties in the laboratory against normal strains of Culex quinquefasciatus,
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. sitiens, Anopheles stephensi, An. culicifacies, Aedes 
      aegypti and Armigeres subalbatus and against strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus
      resistant to fenthion and malathion. Tralomethrin showed good larvicidal activity
      against all the species tested. LC50 ranged between 7.00 x 10(-6) and 9.10 x
      10(-3) mg (ai)/l. Resistant strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus showed higher
      tolerance than the normal strain. Tralomethrin was more effective against adults 
      of An. culicifacies (LD50 0.18 micrograms/cm2) than the other species. Residual
      activity of this compound lasted for 15 weeks on thatch surface at a dosage of 50
      mg (ai)/m2 against all the mosquito species tested. In the field, this compound
      was effective for a period of 1-2 days in polluted water viz., cesspits and
      drains and 10-24 days in less polluted water as in cement tanks, when applied at 
      the rate of 0.002-2.0 mg (ai)/l against immatures of Cx. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Evaluation of the water fern Azolla microphylla for mosquito population
      management in the rice-land agro-ecosystem of south India.
PG  - 299-310
AB  - The floating water fern Azolla microphylla Kaulfess was evaluated as a biocontrol
      agent against mosquitoes breeding in rice fields in Tamil Nadu, South India.
      Anopheles subpictus Grassi, Culex pseudovishnui Colless and Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus Giles were the predominant species of mosquitoes, with peak
      densities of late instar larvae and pupae occurring during the second week after 
      transplantation of rice seedlings of short-term (c. 80 days from transplantation 
      to harvest) or medium-term (c. 95 days) varieties. Immature mosquito populations 
      were reduced by mats of Azolla microphylla covering more than 80% of the water
      surface. However, since 80% coverage by Azolla was achieved only 13-14 days after
      rice transplantation, its usefulness for mosquito control was limited. Azolla may
      have a greater potential in an integrated control programme, or in areas where
      long-term varieties of rice are predominantly grown.

TI  - A quantitative survey of anophelines in six villages of Kheda District, Gujarat.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - Sampling of anophelines from six villages of Kheda district, Gujarat was done
      using four different methods viz. indoor resting, outdoor resting, bovine bait
      trap and immature collections. A total of 113,487 specimens representing 17
      species were collected. An. subpictus (66.51 per cent) was most abundant species 
      followed by An. culicifacies (14.12 per cent) and An. tessellatus (5.24 per
      cent). Bovine bait collections were found most productive yielding maximum
      species and highest number of anophelines per unit of collection efforts. Indoor 
      resting collections yielded poorest diversity and greater number of specimens per
      unit of collection effort than outdoor resting collections. Maximum diversity was
      observed in outdoor collections. Most of the species exhibited unimodal
      prevalence.

      Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat States, India.
PG  - 255-9
AB  - Studies conducted in Warangal, Khammam and Mahabubnagar districts in Andhra
      Pradesh and Surat district in Gujarat have revealed that Anopheles culicifacies
      sensu lato (s.l.) populations were resistant to malathion. In the absence of
      indoor spraying of malathion in public health programs in the 3 districts of
      Andhra Pradesh, resistance is attributed to the extensive use of pesticides in
      agriculture. Species B and C were sympatric in all areas surveyed, and both the
      species were resistant to malathion. In most of the surveys carried out in
      Mahabubnagar, Khammam and Warangal, levels of resistance were higher in species C
      than in B. In Mahabubnagar district an increase in resistance from 5.5 to 64% was
      observed from 1985 to 1987 in An. culicifacies s.l. The proportion of species C
      was low in the initial 2 surveys, and in the later surveys the proportion was
      almost equal to that of species B; the resistance level was also significantly
      higher than in species B. In Surat district, where resistance ranged from 74 to
      93%, the level of resistance in the 2 species was almost the same.

AB  - Studies on ecological succession and association of anophelines in selected paddy
      fields of Dadraul PHC were carried out in 1988 during the paddy cultivation
      period from June to October. Breeding of five anophelines was observed in paddy
      fields. Out of the adults that emerged from larval collections the percentage of 
      An. subpictus was the highest followed by An. nigerrimus, An. culicifacies, An.
      annularis and An. barbirostris. Further, An. culicifacies and An. subpictus
      breeding occurred in the early stage of rice cultivation and stopped before the
      breeding of An. nigerrimus started i.e., nearly 30 days after rice
      transplantation. An. nigerrimus breeding continued till harvesting. An inverse
      correlation between larval density of both An. culicifacies and An. subpictus and
      the height of the rice plants was observed.

      high in the year 1988 in comparison to that of 1987 and 1989. P. falciparum was
      the predominant species. The population living in forest fringe areas were more
      prone to malaria than the rest. Anopheles nigerrimus, An. kochi, An. karwari and 
      An. philippinensis were most abundant among the 16 anopheline species collected. 
      Known vectors of malaria such as An. minimus, An. philippinensis, An. annularis
      and An. dirus were detected. An. dirus was incriminated as vector during this
      study.

      formed 5% of the total collection prevails equally both indoors and outdoors. The
      high parity rate of An. philippinensis (59%) and An. minimus (63.9%) gives a
      strong indication about their vectorial status in Tripura.

      deltamethrin in the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Aedes aegypti L. and
      Anopheles stephensi Liston developed by laboratory selections with deltamethrin, 
      DDT or deltamethrin and the synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in the ratio of
      1:5, was investigated. There was a significant correlation with mono-oxygenase
      activity and larval LC50 to deltamethrin in various strains of all the three
      species. In addition, the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),
      the main NADPH generating enzyme for mono-oxygenases, also showed enhanced
      activity in deltamethrin and DDT-selected strains. The present data, therefore,
      clearly suggest that deltamethrin resistance in the larvae of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi is mainly due to the
      detoxification of deltamethrin by microsomal mono-oxygenases. High activity of
      G6PD observed in DDT-selected strains seems to be related to its role as a
      rate-limiting enzyme in GSH-dependent dehydrochlorination of DDT.

      India.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Identification of host blood meals collected on filter paper in the field from
      fully fed female anophelines was carried out by a microdot-ELISA; field-caught
      mosquito species were simultaneously identified. The results indicate that the
      percentages of mixed feeds, i.e., mosquitoes feeding both on human and cattle
      hosts to complete a blood meal, was only 3-4%. Human and mixed feeds together
      accounted for nearly 10% of bloodmeals. Mosquitoes collected from human dwellings
      did not show a higher percentage of human feeding than cattle feeding. The human 
      blood index was found to be related to the proportion of human and cattle
      population in an area.

TI  - Pattern of rice cultivation and anopheline breeding in Koraput district of Orissa
      state.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - The potentiality of rice fields in anopheline vector breeding in Koraput district
      was studied in two agricultural seasons--rubi and kharif. Altogether, 17 species 
      were recorded from the rice fields. The terraced stream bed paddy-fields with a
      perceptible water flow in top-hill areas support heavy breeding of the principal 
      vector A. fluviatilis at all stages of paddy growth. A. culicifacies and A.
      annularis breeding became scarce when the paddy plants reached a height of 80 cm.
      Vector species formed 2 per cent in rabi and 32 per cent in kharif of the
      anopheline fauna from the paddy fields and the maximum production was during
      early stage of paddy growth or after harvesting.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence of anophelines in Kheda district, Gujarat.
PG  - 9-18
AB  - Seasonal changes in the population structure of anophelines were studied in Kheda
      district, Gujarat. Mosquito collections were made from the villages of Nadiad
      taluka, representing 3 different physiographic zones. Maximum number of
      anopheline species (13) were recorded from canal irrigated area followed by 11
      species from non-canal irrigated and 8 species from riverine areas. Four
      anophelines namely An. subpictus, An. culicifacies, An. annularis and An.
      stephensi were predominant. High densities of An. culicifacies and An. subpictus 
      were recorded in March and August. Results of a four year study (1985 to 1988) on
      the population of anophelines from 3 different physiographic entities showed
      marked differences in the seasonal abundance of different species.

AB  - A study was carried out to evaluate the potentiality of Juvenile hormone compound
      JHM/S-31183 against immatures of mosquitoes in natural habitats. Of two
      formulations tested 1% emulsifiable formulation was marginally superior than the 
      granule formulation. Adult emergence of An. stephensi was completely inhibited
      upto 12 weeks when 0.5% granule formulation was applied at 0.04 ppm in wells as
      against 50% inhibition upto 8 weeks in pools. However, in Culex quinquefasciatus 
      the per cent inhibition of adult emergence varied from 52 to 90 per cent. 100%
      inhibition in pools upto one week at 0.04 ppm in An. stephensi was also obtained 
      with 1% emulsifiable formulation but the effect was diluted in successive weeks. 
      The impact of this formulation was not much pronounced against Culex
      quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Bionomics of Anopheles culicifacies giles in riverine tract rural areas of
      district Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
PG  - 19-28
AB  - Studies on seasonal prevalence, resting behaviour, gonotropic conditions and
      breeding habits of Anopheles culicifacies were carried out from January 1987 to
      December 1989 in riverine villages of Dadraul PHC in Shahjahanpur district, Uttar
      Pradesh. Man hour densities of An. culicifacies varied from 11.3 to 125.1 during 
      the study period. The species showed two peaks of high prevalence: one during
      March to June and the other during October to December. The first peak was higher
      than the second. The collection revealed a higher proportion of freshly fed to
      semi-gravid females thus indicating the outdoor resting behaviour of the species.
      From the immatures collected from riverbed pools, 7 anopheline species were
      identified. Of the 955 specimens identified, An. culicifacies constituted the
      highest number (62.1%). The study indicates that low rainfall and drought did not
      affect An. culicifacies densities or malaria transmission in riverine areas.

TI  - Role of Azolla in controlling mosquito breeding in Ghaziabad district villages
      (U.P.).
PG  - 51-4
AB  - A survey was carried out during post-monsoon period (1988-89) in villages of
      Dhaulana Primary Health Centre, Distt. Ghaziabad (U.P.) to evaluate the utility
      of Azolla pinnata for the control of mosquito breeding in different habitats.
      Results of the survey revealed that pools, ponds, wells, rice fields and drains
      were infested with Azolla. Infestation rate and intensity of infestation varied
      from habitat to habitat. Maximum infestation (36.5%) was observed in pools and
      minimum (3.7%) in rice fields. Anopheline breeding was almost completely
      suppressed (0-1.6/dip) in pools, wells and ponds completely covered with Azolla. 
      The breeding of Culex spp. was not completely inhibited in any habitat, though
      reduction in immature density was observed in comparison to control. The role of 
      Azolla in controlling mosquito breeding and its association with the blue green
      algae which fixes nitrogen is discussed.

AB  - Survey of mosquito fauna in certain areas of deltaic Bengal was conducted between
      September 1989 to February 1990. Anopheles vagus predominated in Canning study
      area and Anopheles hyrcanus in Budge Budge. Comparatively low densities of
      Anopheles annularis were recorded from Canning (6.05% of the total anophelines)
      and Budge Budge (7.36% of the total anophelines), respectively. C. vishnui, C.
      pseudovishnui and C. tritaeniorhynchus were collected from both Canning and Budge
      Budge study areas. C. pseudovishnui predominated in Canning and C. vishnui in
      Budge Budge. Amongst the three species of C. vishnui complex, C.
      triateniorhynchus ranked third in order of preponderance at both the study areas.

AB  - The results of experiments to explore the possible existence of a heat shock
      locus in Chironomus and Anopheles which may be comparable to the 93D heat shock
      locus of Drosophila, are presented. None of the heat shock loci in C.
      striatipennis were inducible by benzamide, colchicine, vitamin B6, thiamphenicol 
      or a homogenate of heat shocked glands, all of which are known to selectively
      induce the 93D-like loci in the genus Drosophila. Benzamide also failed to induce
      any locus in A. stephensi. The effect of all these treatments on general
      transcription in Chironomus and Anopheles polytene nuclei were comparable to
      those known in polytene cells of Drosophila. It thus appears that a heat shock
      locus homologous to 93D of D. melanogaster is absent in Chironomus and Anopheles 
      so far as inducibility of a puff by specific agents is concerned. The existence
      of a possible 'functional counterpart' of the 93D locus in Chironomus and
      Anopheles genomes cannot be eliminated.

AB  - A new sesquiterpene lactone alpha/beta arteether (a 30:70 mixture of
      enantiomers), which possesses very high blood schizontocidal activity, has been
      evaluated for gametocytocidal/sporontocidal action against Plasmodium cynomolgi B
      infection in the rhesus monkey. This paper reports gametocytocidal action of this
      new antimalarial drug at 2.5-5 mg/kg (single im dose) against P. cynomologi B as 
      shown by the complete absence of mosquito infectivity. No sporontocidal action
      was demonstrable in the vector at a dose of up to 20-50 mg/kg im.

PG  - 672-6
AB  - Two larval body color mutants, golden-yellow larva (gy) and Black larva (Bl) were
      isolated from laboratory strains of Anopheles stephensi. The inheritance pattern 
      revealed that golden-yellow larva was an autosomal recessive and Black larva an
      autosomal semi-dominant mutant. Both of these mutants were found to be linked
      with a map distance of 3.75 +/- 0.42 and have been placed in linkage group III.

TI  - Breeding habitats of malaria vectors: A. fluviatilis, A. annularis and A.
      culicifacies, in Koraput district, Orissa.
PG  - 209-16
AB  - Anopheline breeding habitats were studied in two different geoclimatic zones. The
      vectors A. fluviatilis, A annularis and A. culicifacies breed in all types of
      habitats. Streams were most productive for the main vector, A. fluviatilis and
      breeding was intense during winter and early summer. In the rainy season,
      breeding occurred in terraced paddy fields. A. culicifacies were produced in
      large numbers in rivers in summer and in paddy fields in rainy and cold seasons. 
      Considering the vastness of these breeding habitats, vector control measures by
      larviciding or any other bioenvironmental means will not be a feasible
      alternative even though house spraying poses serious problems in this area due to
      several reasons. The use of personal protection methods is suggested.

PG  - 187-94
AB  - Density patterns of 17 species of anopheline mosquitoes collected between 1980
      and 1981 from indoor and outdoor resting places of a highly malarious area of
      Bastar district, Madhya Pradesh are given. A. culicifacies and A. fluviatilis are
      the important vector species in the region. The former was highly endophilic and 
      found throughout the year and its man hour density (MHD) ranged from 7.6 to 78
      with peaks in February and July. The latter was highly exophilic, also found
      throughout the year. Its density ranged from 1.6 to 7.0 per 10 man hours with a
      peak in July/August. A. subpictus was considered as potential vector species,
      found throughout the year and was endophilic, having MHD ranging from 0.9 to 148 
      with peaks in February-March and July-August. The MHD variations of other species
      were; A. aconitus (0.02-1.04), A. annularis (0.02-10.4), A. barbirostris
      (0.04-1.07), A. hyrcanus (1.30-1.86), A. jamesii (0.01-0.46), A. jeyporiensis
      (0.01-1.06), A. karwari (0.01-0.04), A. maculatus (0.01-0.03), A. pallidus
      (0.02-2.4), A. splendidus (0.02-0.32), A. tessellatus (0.02-0.12), A. theobaldi
      (0.01-0.03), A. vagus (0.01-2.3) and A. varuna (0.03-0.31). Results of gut and
      gland dissections showed correlation of infection with the occurrence of peak
      vector densities. The density levels and seasonal activities of vectors as well
      as potential vector species are favourable for perennial transmission of malaria 
      in Bastar district.

PG  - 173-81
AB  - Among the seven vector species studied A. fluviatilis, A. jeyporiensis and A.
      maculatus were exophilic whereas A. aconitus, A. annularis, A. culicifacies and
      A. varuna were endophilic. All the species collected indoors preferred
      cattlesheds to human dwellings for daytime resting and 71.3% of the total indoor 
      collection was obtained from cattlesheds. Among the outdoor shelters pit shelters
      were found to be most attractive for all anophelines resting outdoors. In human
      dwellings anophelines generally preferred to rest on walls during winter and
      summer but on ceilings during the rainy season. While A. culicifacies has two
      peaks in density, during June-July and March all the other species had only one
      peak. There was a general decline in the density of vectors observed earlier in
      this area.

AB  - In a study covering two years, 1306 samples of immatures were collected from 7
      different breeding habitats of canal irrigated villages of Kheda district in
      Gujarat. Out of the samples belonging to 8 anopheline species, 14396 adults
      emerged. Breeding of An. culicifacies was associated with An. annularis in ponds,
      paddy fields, small pools and with An. stephensi in paddy fields. Maximum
      association was observed between An. barbirostris and An. nigerrimus in
      irrigation canals and An. culicifacies and An. subpictus in intradomestic
      containers. An. annularis, An. stephensi and An. subpictus were strongly
      associated in paddy fields. Strong interspecific repulsion was observed between
      An. subpictus and An. stephensi in intradomestic containers and An. barbirostris 
      and An. subpictus in ponds.

TI  - Role of insects as inhalant allergens in bronchial asthma with special reference 
      to the clinical characteristics of patients.
PG  - 519-24
AB  - The whole body extracts (WBEs) of 13 common insects from Delhi, namely Musca
      domestica (house fly); Sitophilus oryzae (rice weevil); Callosobrochous maculatus
      (pulse beetle); Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti
      (mosquitoes); Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana (cockroaches: male,
      female and nymph); Spodoptera litura and Heliothis armigera (moths), were
      prepared to evaluate their allergenic significance in patients with allergic
      bronchial asthma. Intradermal (ID) tests were performed with these WBEs on 75
      patients with bronchial asthma and 20 healthy non-allergic volunteers. An ID test
      was considered positive when the weal diameter was more than twice that of
      phosphate-buffered saline control and at least 6 mm in size and an erythema of
      more than 15 mm. In the patients 27.7% of the ID tests performed were total
      positive (1+ to 4+) as compared to 7.1% in the controls. Ten point two per cent
      of ID responses were markedly positive in asthmatics (2+ to 4+) as against none
      in controls. Of the 13 bronchial provocation tests (BPTs) performed on patients
      giving positive cutaneous responses, eight (61.5%) were positive. Similarly,
      RASTs were positive in 87.5% of the limited sera tested from the patients with
      positive ID responses. The patients with a positive family history of allergic
      disorders gave higher percentages of positive ID responses as compared to the
      asthmatics with no family history. Similarly, the ID positivity was significantly
      higher in patients with associated allergic diseases like allergic rhinitis as
      compared to the patients with bronchial asthma alone. Interestingly, we observed 
      significantly higher ID response to insects in seasonal asthmatics.(ABSTRACT

AB  - Cytogenetic and crossing data provide strong evidence for the existence of
      another species, dirus E in southwestern India, within the Dirus Complex of
      Anopheles. These findings are in accord with unpublished morphological
      observations. Our data suggest a significant genetic divergence between species E
      and its close relatives, An. dirus A, B and C in Thailand. These data also
      suggest that dirus E is an incipient sibling species of its geographically
      nearest relative, dirus D, and that it seemingly co-evolved through the process
      of allopatric speciation.

      absolute protection against mosquito bites. The protection varied from 38 to 98% 
      with different species of mosquitoes. In general, better protection was provided 
      against Anopheles bite than against Culex. Of ten repellents evaluated. Mylol oil
      and Tortoise coils were marginally superior to Odomos cream and Rooster coils.
      Among electrical devices, Good Bye and Casper were marginally superior to Good

      entomological survey, Anopheles maculatus was collected more than other 10
      anopheline species encountered. A. minimus was detected and incriminated as a
      vector species.

TI  - Studies on malaria transmission in Orissa state: Part I. Development of a
      methodology for systematic studies.
PG  - 102-15
AB  - Standardized collections of Anopheles were conducted by three Entomology Field
      Investigation Units (FIU's) working in three distinctively different areas of
      Orissa State. The FIU's conducted identical routine weekly work schedules in each
      of 12 mesoendemic or hyperendemic study villages every month. In addition,
      monthly house-to-house fever case surveys were conducted in each study village
      and biannual malariometric surveys were carried out with the timing being
      shifted, so that eventually all seasons were included. Such complete, extensive
      and meticulous entomological and epidemiological data have not been obtained
      earlier from this area. In fact, until the present longitudinal data became
      available, it was necessary to rely upon information which was gathered some 40
      years ago, when environmental conditions were substantially different. The
      ensuing article describes the methodology that was employed to establish these
      systematic studies.

AB  - A field study to evaluate the impact of deltamethrin spraying on DDT and HCH
      resistant A. culicifacies population was carried out in Razapur primary health
      centre (PHC), Distt. Ghaziabad (U.P.) India. The PHC comprising of about 0.14
      million population was divided into 3 sections of equal size and sprayed with (i)
      3 rounds at 12.5 mg/sq m at 6 weeks interval, and (ii) 2 rounds each at 20 mg/sq 
      m and 25 mg/sq m at 8 weeks interval. One section in Dadri PHC located at a
      distance of about 22 kms was held as control. In this area 3 rounds of HCH were
      sprayed by the NMEP as was done to control malaria in this district. Deltamethrin
      spraying was carried out for 3 years. Results revealed that spraying at 12.5, 20 
      and 25 mg/sq m resulted in drastic reduction of DDT and HCH resistant A.
      culicifacies population and in the interruption of malaria transmission. In
      control area high vector densities and malaria transmission was encountered
      throughout the period of study. Spraying of deltamethrin resulted in build-up of 
      Culex quinquefasciatus population due to resistance.

TI  - Development of a methodology for malariogenic stratification as a tool for
      malaria control.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Modified plan of operation (MPO) for malaria control launched in 1977 failed to
      curb malaria incidence beyond about 2 million cases per annum and thus
      necessitated development of multipronged malaria control strategies based upon
      malariogenic stratification. A model for such stratification based upon six most 
      sensitive, but quantifiable, epidemiological parameters for which records are
      easily available at PHC level, namely, topography, average annual rainfall,
      vector(s), average annual parasite incidence (API) for the last five years,
      epidemic potential and vulnerability was developed. This model has been
      successfully tried in the State of Karnataka and on that basis the whole State
      has been divided into five strata in order of increasing endemicity. Objectives
      of malaria control for each of the stratum so defined have been proposed.

AB  - The characteristics of primary and secondary asexual peak parasitaemia during
      sporozoite induced Plasmodium cynomolgi B infections in 40 rhesus monkeys have
      been studied. Colony bred Anopheles stephensi were fed on different days on the
      gametocyte carrying monkeys and the infectivity of mosquitoes as determined by
      oocyst count on day 8 post-feeding was recorded. Following the day of sporozoite 
      inoculation, the mean prepatent period was 8.58 +/- 0.87 days. The primary
      asexual peak was attained on day 8.38 +/- 2.27 and the secondary peak on day
      15.15 +/- 2.63 after patency. Infectivity rate was 100% in 144 batches of
      mosquitoes fed three days before to three days after the secondary asexual peak. 
      Judging from the day of patency, the high oocyst count was obtained between day
      12-18 after patency. Infective gametocyte peak coincided with the secondary
      asexual peak parasitaemia, with the result that maximum oocyst number was
      observed in batches fed on the day of secondary peak or one day prior to or one
      day after the secondary peak. Infectivity during the period of primary asexual
      peak was inconsistent.

AB  - A study on the bioenvironmental control of malaria was launched in 1983 in Nadiad
      taluka, Gujarat, with help of village communities. The implementation of strategy
      resulted in the successful control of larval mosquitoes and reduction in the
      adult vector populations, and the impact was visible in the curtailment of
      malaria transmission in large rural areas. When compared with the residual
      spraying of insecticides under the National Malaria Eradication Programme, the
      alternate strategy was found feasible, socially acceptable, cost effective and
      brought about environmental improvement and awareness in the rural areas.

PG  - 153-7
AB  - A total of 1401 adult mosquitoes mainly dominated by Anopheles sundaicus (40.18%)
      and Culex quinquefasciatus (57.31%) were collected from Kamorta and Great Nicobar
      Islands. It was revealed from human bait collection that both species prevailed
      almost all through the night (density 8.1/man hour) with a peak around midnight. 
      Mixed breeding of A. sundaicus with A. vagus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx.
      bitaeniorhynchus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was observed at many places. Adult A. 
      sundaicus were found highly susceptible to DDT and larvae to Temephos (Abate).
      Cx. quinquefasciatus was resistant to DDT (31% mortality). High parity of A.
      sundaicus (40.42%) is an indication of the vectorial potential of this species to
      sustain malaria transmission in these islands.

TI  - Malaria & other common ailments among upper Bonda tribals in Koraput district,
      Orissa.
PG  - 334-9
AB  - A malariometric survey carried out among the upper Bonda tribals of Koraput
      district showed that malaria is the major cause of morbidity followed by worm
      infestation and malnutrition. A total of individuals 1,409 (32.2% of the
      population) were sampled and 771 were found positive for malaria parasites.
      Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite (73.7%) followed by P. vivax
      (10.6%) and P. malariae (5.2%) among the positive cases. Mixed infection was
      observed in 10.5 per cent of positive individuals. The infant parasite rate was
      60.0 per cent and the average enlarged spleen among the children between 2-9 yr
      was 2.11. The age specific parasite rate indicated high degree transmission and
      high level of acquired resistance among the tribals.

PG  - 218-21
AB  - Villages in South Arcot and Tirunelveli districts with high incidence of Japanese
      Encephalitis were selected for the study of insecticidal resistance to vectors.
      Culex vishnui and Anopheles hyrcanus group were found to be resistant to DDT (4
      per cent for 60 min. exposure) and dieldrin (0.4 per cent for 60 min. exposure)
      but susceptible to Malathion (5 per cent for 60 min. exposure). So far, this is
      perhaps the first report of Anopheles hyrcanus group resistant to DDT and
      dieldrin to be reported from this area. The resistance may be due to extensive
      use of DDT and HCH for agricultural purposes.

PG  - 65-74
AB  - Information on anopheline fauna of Kheda district in Gujarat dates back to 1950. 
      Since then there have been vast ecological changes due to development projects
      and intensive irrigation. To study the anopheline fauna of Kheda district
      collections from 164 villages representing 7 talukas of the district were made.
      Sixteen anopheline species were recorded, of these 8 species were recorded for
      the first time. Maximum number of anopheline species (16) were recorded from
      canal irrigated area followed by 11 species from riverine area and 10 species
      from non-canal irrigated area. Four anopheline species namely An. subpictus, An. 
      culicifacies, An. annularis and An. stephensi were predominant and constituted
      99.9% of the total anophelines and rest of the 12 species accounted for 0.1%. In 
      this paper, results of the study on mosquito ecology with particular emphasis on 
      species specific breeding preferences, associations and frequency of distribution
      in various types of aquatic habitats have been reported.

      July 1988. Epidemiological findings revealed high spleen (20-70), child parasite 
      (40-85) and infant parasite rates (20-75) in the area. P. falciparum was the
      predominant species and unchecked malaria transmission continued almost
      throughout the year. The study of monthwise distribution of positive cases and
      the period during which intensive intervention measures were undertaken revealed 
      that despite an extra round of HCH and intensive chemotherapeutic measures, there
      was no marked decrease in the prevalence of malaria.

AB  - In 1981 Entomological Field Research Units were established in three districts of
      Orissa State, India, from which Anopheles bloodmeals were forwarded regularly for
      analysis to an Entomological Laboratory in Bhubaneswar. At the onset of 1982, the
      laboratory introduced a modified gel diffusion technique for determining the
      origin of mosquito bloodmeals and by the end of 1983, 22,300 smears had been
      processed and analyzed. The technique is relatively very simple, fast and
      inexpensive. The results are reproducible and the use of double controls
      (negative and positive) ensure a high degree of reliability.

TI  - Breeding habitats of mosquitoes in Goa.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - Studies carried out in Goa from 1986 to 1987 revealed immature stages of 43
      species of mosquitoes. Breeding habitats were divided into three categories,
      viz., (i) Ground water habitats consisting of ground pools and tanks, rocky
      pools, paddy fields and stream beds, yielding 30 species; (ii) Plant habitats
      consisting of tree holes and fallen coconut shells and leaf sheaths yielding 20
      species; and (iii) Domestic/peridomestic habitats consisting of cement tanks,
      glass, earthen, metallic containers and tyres yielding 11 species. Five species
      viz., Anopheles subpictus, Aedes albopictus, Armigeres subalbatus, Culex
      quinquefasciatus and Cx. pallidothorax were found in all three types of habitats.
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus preferred to breed in ground pools and paddy fields but was
      found in domestic cement tanks and ground tanks in adverse season. Majority of
      the anophelines and culicines were found in ground water habitats. Five out of 11
      species of Aedes were found in tree holes. Aedes aegypti and Toxorhynchites
      splendens were found only in discarded tyres. Three species of the genus
      Uranotaenia, viz., U. bicolor, U. stricklandi and U. campestris were recorded
      from stream beds and plant containers.

PG  - 48-51
AB  - The role of permethrin impregnated bednets at the application rate of 0.5 g
      (ai)/m2 in reducing A. culicifacies population in a tribal village of Orissa,
      highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum was studied. The per man-hour density
      was significantly reduced in the Kenduguda village for about three months where
      impregnated bednets were supplied to the villagers, while in the control village 
      Deulaguda where unimpregnated nets were supplied, vector density remained high

TI  - Artemisinin (qinghaosu)--a new gametocytocidal drug for malaria.
PG  - 200-7
AB  - Gametocytocidal activity of artemisinin (qinghaosu) has been demonstrated against
      simian malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi B. Colony-bred Anopheles stephensi
      were allowed to feed on gametocyte-carrying rhesus monkeys and the mosquito
      infectivity rate and oocyst count of the infected mosquito gut were recorded on
      day 8-9 postinfection. Control (pretreatment) feedings of mosquito on
      gametocyte-carrying monkeys showed good infectivity in different batches of the
      mosquitoes ranging from 57.14 to 95.0%. Administration of single intramuscular
      injection of 5 mg/kg artemisinin (suspended in neutralised oil) resulted in
      complete loss of mosquito infectivity within 24 h of drug administration. This is
      the first report on the possible use of artemisinin to stop malaria transmission.
      The drug has no sporontocidal action.

TI  - Population cytogenetics of the malaria vector Anopheles leucosphyrus group.
PG  - 667-80
AB  - Until recently, very little was known of Anopheles species complexes and their
      relationships to epidemiology and malaria transmission in Southeast Asia. During 
      the past eight years, extensive studies on the genetics of natural populations of
      anopheline mosquitoes in this region, involving the interdisciplinary efforts of 
      taxonomists, operational entomologists and biologists, have revealed groups of
      cryptic species of Anopheles vectors, particularly the An. leucos phyrus group.
      This species group comprise seventeen species and two subspecies widely
      distributed in the forested areas of Southeast Asia. Among these species. An.
      dirus Peyton and Harrison, has been shown by cytogenetic and morphological
      studies to be a complex of at least seven isomorphic species, provisionally
      designated species A, B, C, D, E, F and takasagoensis, on the Southeast Asian
      mainland. Cytological identification of these species is based on distinct
      banding patterns of salivary gland polytene chromosomes as well as
      heterochromatin differences in mitotic karyotypes. The five species found in
      Thailand (A-D, F) exhibit distinct geographic distributions. Species A is
      widespread throughout Thailand except in the south. Species B had been found in
      sympatry with species C in southern Thailand and both seem to show north-south
      clinal geographic variation. Species D is common on the west side of southern
      Thailand and along the Thai-Burmese border in sympatry with species A. Species F,
      An. nemophilous Peyton and Ramalingam, has been found in a population at the
      Thai-Malaysian border in this study although it was known to be common in
      southern and western Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. Species E is known only
      from western India. The five species found in Thailand also exhibit seasonal
      variation in relative abundance and different nocturnal biting cycles.
      Chromosomal polymorphisms have been observed in mitotic and polytene chromosomes 
      of An. dirus A and D. Species B and C also show heterochromatin variation in the 
      sex chromosomes, but are monomorphic for the standard sequence in polytene
      chromosomes. These biological characteristics of the An. dirus complex may have
      implications for understanding the epidemiology of malaria in Southeast Asia.
      Recent cytogenetic studies of wild-caught samples of An. leucosphyrus from
      Sumatra, Kalimantan and southern Thailand have revealed the presence of two
      distinct species within this taxon. Species A is widely distributed in southern
      Thailand, East Malaysia and Kalimantan, while species B is confined to Sumatra.
      The two isomorphic species are vectors of human malaria within their range of
      distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Bio-environmental control of malaria in an industrial complex at Hardwar (U.P.), 
      India.
PG  - 426-30
AB  - A study on the bio-environmental control of industrial malaria was launched at
      Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., the country's foremost industrial complex. Malaria
      was a serious problem on the campus of the complex and routine methods of malaria
      control by providing screened doors, larviciding, fogging, limited spraying in
      the unauthorized colonies and chemotherapy were not effective. The project staff 
      diverted the existing resources to reduce mosquito breeding sites by using fly
      ash to fill low lying areas, borrow pits and ditches, etc.; cleaning blocked
      drains and improving drainage by constructing cemented drains, mosquito-proofing 
      overhead water storage tanks, improving surveillance and chemotherapy and
      introducing developmental schemes to make it a holistic process. The entire
      campus was brought under the alternate strategy during a 5 month period. In less 
      than one year indigenous transmission was interrupted and the areas brought under
      maintenance at a cost of US +28,000. The study showed that in this instance
      malaria control should first be based on source reduction rather than
      insecticidal methods.
