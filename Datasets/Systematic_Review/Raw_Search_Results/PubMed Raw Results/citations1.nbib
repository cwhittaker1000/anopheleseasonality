TI  - Toxicity studies of nanofabricated palladium against filariasis and malaria
      vectors.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-0428-x [doi]
AB  - The present study was carried out to establish the biofabrication of palladium
      nanoparticles (PdNPs) using the plant leaf extract of Tinospora cordifolia Miers 
      and its toxicity studies on the larvae of filariasis vector, Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say and malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi. The
      biofabricated PdNPs were characterized by using UV-visible spectrum, FTIR, XRD,
      FESEM, EDX and HRTEM. HRTEM confirmed the PdNPs were slightly agglomerated and
      spherical in shape and the average size was 16 nm. Gas chromatography and mass
      spectrometry analysis result revealed that the major constituent present in the
      T. cordifolia leaf extract is 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (31.79%) whereas the minor 
      compounds are 1-hexadecanol (7.97%), 1-octadecanol (7.70%), 1-eicosanol (6.85%), 
      behenic alcohol (5.36%), 1-tetradecene (6.22%), cyclotetradecane (6.23%),
      1-hexadecene (7.97%), 1-octadecene (7.70%), 1-eicosene (6.85%), and 1-docosene
      (5.36%). T. cordifolia leaf extract exhibited the larvicidal activity against the
      fourth instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus and A. subpictus with the values of
      LC50 = 59.857 and 54.536 mg/L; LC90 = 113.445 and 108.940 mg/L, respectively. The
      highest toxicity was observed in the biofabricated PdNPs against the fourth
      instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus and A. subpictus with the values of LC50 =
      6.090 and 6.454 mg/L; LC90 = 13.689 and 13.849 mg/L, respectively. Concerning
      non-target effects, Poecilia reticulata were exposed to PdNPs for 24 h and did
      not exhibit any noticeable toxicity. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that 
      PdNPs is a perfect ecological and inexpensive approach for the control of
      filariasis and malaria vectors.

TI  - Disappearance of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus from Certain Malaria
      Endemic Areas of Assam, India.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orang Primary Health Centre (OPHC) and Balipara Primary Health Centre
      (BPHC) of Assam (India) report mosquito borne diseases annually. Current study
      was performed to ascertain the prevalence of known malaria and Japanese
      Encephalitis (JE) vectors and their possible role in disease transmission.
      METHODS: Malaria epidemiological data for 2006-2010 and JE data for 2008-2013 of 
      Assam, India were obtained from the health authority. Mosquitoes were collected
      using CDC light traps and identified morpho-taxonomically. RESULTS: Plasmodium
      falciparum cases (81.5%, 95% CI= 72.0-91.1) were statistically higher in OPHC (P<
      0.0001, t= 8.0) during the recent years. There was 4.4 folds rise in the
      confirmed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and 3.2 folds increase in the
      confirmed JE cases during 2013 as compared to 2008. Altogether 9,218 mosquito
      specimens (PTND= 153.6), comprising of 44.1% anophelines (PTND= 67.7), 42.3%
      culicines (PTND= 65.0) and 9.5% mansonia (PTND= 14.6) were recorded. In BPHC,
      Anopheles vagus was recorded in high density (P< 0.0001), whereas Culex
      quinquefasciatus was the predominant JE vector (P= 0.04). In OPHC, among the
      known malaria vectors, the density of Anopheles annularis was significantly high 
      (P< 0.0001). However Culex bitaeniorhynchus was the predominant known JE vector
      (P< 0.0001) followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus. CONCLUSION: Even in the absence of 
      known efficient vectors, many Anopheles species are still involved in malaria
      transmission. There was disappearance of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus
      and establishment of An. annularis, An. vagus and An. philippinensis/nivipes
      mosquitoes in study area.

LID - S0001-706X(17)30430-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.09.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria,
      infecting 40-75% of arthropod species. Knowledge on distribution of native
      strains infecting mosquito vectors from endemic regions is essential for
      successful implementation of vector control interventions utilizing potential
      strains of Wolbachia. Study identified various native strains of Wolbachia
      inhabiting different mosquito species from field and colonised conditions of
      Assam. The fly Drosophila melanogaster was also included in our study. METHODS:
      Different mosquito species collected from field viz; Aedes albopictus, Aedes
      aegypti, Anopheles hyrcanus, Anopheles annularis, Culex vishnui, Toxorhynchites
      splendens, Armegeries obturbans and fly Drosophila melanogaster were included in 
      the study. Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus were obtained from
      RMRC, Dibrugarh mosquito colony y for Wolbachia screening. DNA was extracted from
      these species, amplified using group specific wsp primers followed by sequencing 
      and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Aedes albopictus from Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and
      Sivasagar district showed superinfection with A and B group of Wolbachia but,
      Aedes albopictus from Tezpur district presented infection with A group only. Our 
      study reports for the first time natural infection of Wolbachia A and B group
      from colonised Anopheles stephensi mosquito but reported no infection from field 
      collected Anopheles hyrcanus or Anopheles annularis. Similarly Armigeres
      obturbans and Culex vishnui presented infection with only B group of Wolbachia.
      Drosophila melanogaster showed superinfection with A and B group. Toxorhynchites 
      splendens, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus reported no infection with
      Wolbachia. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on
      Wolbachia screening from Northeast part of India and also first report of natural
      Wolbachia infection from colonised Anopheles stephensi species. The current
      understanding on distribution of Wolbachia strains naturally present within
      insect species from this geographical region should aid future Wolbachia mediated
      vector control strategies.

TI  - Biosurfactants produced by Bacillus subtilis A1 and Pseudomonas stutzeri NA3
      reduce longevity and fecundity of Anopheles stephensi and show high toxicity
      against young instars.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-0105-0 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles stephensi acts as vector of Plasmodium parasites, which are responsible
      for malaria in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Currently, malaria
      management is a big challenge due to the presence of insecticide-resistant
      strains as well as to the development of Plasmodium species highly resistant to
      major antimalarial drugs. Therefore, the present study focused on biosurfactant
      produced by two bacteria Bacillus subtilis A1 and Pseudomonas stutzeri NA3,
      evaluating them for insecticidal applications against malaria mosquitoes. The
      produced biosurfactants were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy and gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which confirmed that biosurfactants had
      a lipopeptidic nature. Both biosurfactants were tested against larvae and pupae
      of A. stephensi. LC50 values were 3.58 (larva I), 4.92 (II), 5.73 (III), 7.10
      (IV), and 7.99 (pupae) and 2.61 (I), 3.68 (II), 4.48 (III), 5.55 (IV), and 6.99
      (pupa) for biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis A1 and P. stutzeri NA3,
      respectively. Treatments with bacterial surfactants led to various physiological 
      changes including longer pupal duration, shorter adult oviposition period, and
      reduced longevity and fecundity. To the best of our knowledge, there are really
      limited reports on the mosquitocidal and physiological effects due to
      biosurfactant produced by bacterial strains. Overall, the toxic activity of these
      biosurfactant on all young instars of A. stephensi, as well as their major impact
      on adult longevity and fecundity, allows their further consideration for the
      development of insecticides in the fight against malaria mosquitoes.

TI  - Managing wastes as green resources: cigarette butt-synthesized pesticides are
      highly toxic to malaria vectors with little impact on predatory copepods.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-0074-3 [doi]
AB  - The development of novel mosquito control tools is a key prerequisite to build
      effective and reliable Integrated Vector Management strategies. Here, we proposed
      a novel method using cigarette butts for the synthesis of Ag nanostructures toxic
      to young instars of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, chloroquine
      (CQ)-resistant malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and microbial pathogens.
      The non-target impact of these nanomaterials in the aquatic environment was
      evaluated testing them at sub-lethal doses on the predatory copepod Mesocyclops
      aspericornis. Cigarette butt-synthesized Ag nanostructures were characterized by 
      UV-vis and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as by EDX, SEM and XRD analyses. Low doses 
      of cigarette butt extracts (with and without tobacco) showed larvicidal and
      pupicidal toxicity on An. stephensi. The LC50 of cigarette butt-synthesized Ag
      nanostructures ranged from 4.505 ppm (I instar larvae) to 8.070 ppm (pupae) using
      smoked cigarette butts with tobacco, and from 3.571 (I instar larvae) to 6.143
      ppm (pupae) using unsmoked cigarette butts without tobacco. Smoke toxicity
      experiments conducted against adults showed that unsmoked cigarette butts-based
      coils led to mortality comparable to permethrin-based positive control (84.2 and 
      91.2%, respectively). A single treatment with cigarette butts extracts and Ag
      nanostructures significantly reduced egg hatchability of An. stephensi.
      Furthermore, the antiplasmodial activity of cigarette butt extracts (with and
      without tobacco) and synthesized Ag nanostructures was evaluated against
      CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of P. falciparum. The lowest 
      IC50 values were achieved by cigarette butt extracts without tobacco, they were
      54.63 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 63.26 mug/ml (CQ-r); while Ag nanostructure IC50 values
      were 72.13 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 77.33 mug/ml (CQ-r). In MIC assays, low doses of the
      Ag nanostructures inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi. Finally, the predation efficiency of copepod M. 
      aspericornis towards larvae of An. stephensi did not decrease in a
      nanoparticle-contaminated environment, if compared to control predation assays.
      Overall, the present research would suggest that an abundant hazardous waste,
      such as cigarette butts, can be turned to an important resource for nanosynthesis
      of highly effective antiplasmodials and insecticides.

AB  - Dengue and chikungunya fevers are transmitted by the common mosquito vector Aedes
      and malaria by Anopheles. Concurrent infections are reported due to
      co-circulation of these pathogens, especially in endemic regions. We report a
      rare case of triple infection with 3 arthropod-borne pathogens (Plasmodium vivax 
      and the dengue and chikungunya viruses) in a 3-year-old child from New Delhi,
      India, in August 2016. The viruses were identified by RT-PCR and the parasite by 
      microscopy and antigen detection. The dengue virus serotype 3 sequence was
      clustered in the genotype III by the phylogenetic analysis. Mixed infection with 
      multiple pathogens is a challenge for accurate diagnosis due to the overlapping
      clinical symptoms. The accurate and timely diagnosis of multiple pathogens in
      such cases is important for rapid and effective patient management.

TI  - Response to Blood Meal in the Fat Body of Anopheles stephensi Using Quantitative 
      Proteomics: Toward New Vector Control Strategies Against Malaria.
PG  - 520-530
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0092 [doi]
AB  - Malaria remains a grand challenge for disruptive innovation in global health
      therapeutics and diagnostics. Anopheles stephensi is one of the major vectors of 
      malaria in Asia. Vector and transmission control are key focus areas in the fight
      against malaria, a field of postgenomics research where proteomics can play a
      substantive role. Moreover, to identify novel strategies to control the vector
      population, it is necessary to understand the vector life processes at a global
      and molecular scale. In this context, fat body is a vital organ required for
      vitellogenesis, vector immunity, vector physiology, and vector-parasite
      interaction. Given its central role in energy metabolism, vitellogenesis, and
      immune function, the proteome profile of the fat body and the impact of blood
      meal (BM) ingestion on the protein abundances of this vital organ have not been
      investigated so far. Therefore, using a proteomics approach, we identified the
      proteins expressed in the fat body of An. stephensi and their differential
      expression in response to BM ingestion. In all, we identified 3,218 proteins in
      the fat body using high-resolution mass spectrometry, of which 483 were found to 
      be differentially expressed in response to the BM ingestion. Bioinformatics
      analysis of these proteins underscored their role in amino acid metabolism,
      vitellogenesis, lipid transport, signal peptide processing, mosquito immunity,
      and oxidation-reduction processes. Interestingly, we identified five novel genes,
      which were found to be differentially expressed upon BM ingestion. Proteins that 
      exhibited altered expression in the present study are potential targets for
      vector control strategies and development of transmission blocking vaccines in
      the fight against malaria.

AB  - Insect-borne diseases remain to this day a major source of illness and death
      worldwide. The resistance to chemical insecticides among mosquito species has
      been considered as a setback in vector control. Mosquito control programs,
      botanical origin may have the potential to eliminate eggs and larvae. So, the
      larvicidal and ovicidal activities of crude benzene, hexane, ethyl acetate,
      chloroform and methanol extracts of Terminalia chebula were assayed for their
      toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles stephensi,
      Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The larval mortality was observed
      after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however,
      the highest larval mortality was found in the methanol extract of T. chebula
      against the larvae of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with the 
      LC50 values were 87.13, 93.24 and 111.98 ppm, respectively. Mean percent
      hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post treatment. The
      percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract
      and directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed
      moderate ovicidal activity; however, the maximum egg mortality (zero
      hatchability) was observed in the methanol extract of T. chebula at 200 and 250
      ppm against A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus showed 100%
      mortality at 300 ppm. No mortality was recorded in the control. The finding of
      the present investigation revealed that the leaf extract of Terminalia chebula
      possesses remarkable larvicidal and ovicidal activity against medically important
      vector mosquitoes and make this plant product promising as an alternative to
      synthetic insecticide in mosquito control programs.

TI  - First record of Anopheles stephensi in Sri Lanka: a potential challenge for
      prevention of malaria reintroduction.
PG  - 326
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1977-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major malaria vector in Sri Lanka is reported to be Anopheles
      culicifacies with Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles annularis, and Anopheles varuna 
      considered as potential vectors. The occurrence of Anopheles stephensi, which is 
      the key vector of urban malaria in India and the Middle East, had never been
      reported from Sri Lanka. METHODS: A series of entomological investigations were
      carried out by the Anti Malaria Campaign, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka during
      December 2016 to April 2017 in two localities of the Mannar District in the
      Northern Province of the country. Adult mosquito collections were done through
      indoor and outdoor resting collections, animal and human biting collections and
      emergence traps. Potential mosquito breeding sites were investigated through
      larval surveys. The larvae and adults of An. stephensi were initially identified 
      using morphological keys, and subsequently confirmed by sequencing the barcode
      region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. RESULTS: This is the first
      report of the presence of An. stephensi in the island of Mannar in the Northern
      Province of Sri Lanka. Anopheles stephensi (36.65%) was the most abundant
      anopheline species in the larval habitats in Mannar. It was found breeding
      together with An. culicifacies (20.7%), An. subpictus (13.5%) and An. varuna
      (28.13%). Anopheles stephensi was found to be abundantly breeding in built wells 
      used for domestic purposes. Adult females of An. stephensi were observed in
      emergence trap collections (93.9%), human landing catches all night (79.2%),
      pyrethrum spray sheet collections (38.6%), outdoor collections (8.3%),
      donkey-baited trap collections (14.3), and cattle-baited net trap collections
      (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Sri Lanka was certified as malaria-free by the WHO in
      September 2016, however, this new finding may pose a serious challenge to the
      efforts of the Ministry of Health to prevent the re-introduction of malaria
      transmission in the country, considering the role that An. stephensi could play
      in urban and high vulnerability areas of Sri Lanka.

TI  - Sex specific molecular responses of quick-to-court protein in Indian malarial
      vector Anopheles culicifacies: conflict of mating versus blood feeding behaviour.
PG  - e00361
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00361 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito behavioural complexity plays a
      central role in designing novel molecular tools to fight against their
      vector-borne diseases. Although the olfactory system plays an important role in
      guiding and managing many behavioural responses including feeding and mating, but
      the sex-specific regulation of olfactory responses remain poorly investigated.
      From our ongoing transcriptomic data annotation of olfactory tissue of blood fed 
      adult female An. culicifacies mosquitoes; we have identified a 383 bp long unique
      transcript encoding a Drosophila homolog of the quick-to-court protein.
      Previously this was shown to regulate courtship behaviour in adult male
      Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the quick-to-court (qtc) gene
      of An. culicifacies (Ac-qtc) predicts a 1536 bp single copy gene encoding 511
      amino acid protein, having a high degree of conservation with other insect
      homologs. The age-dependent increased expression of putative Ac-qtc correlated
      with the maturation of the olfactory system, necessary to meet the sex-specific
      conflicting demand of mating (mate finding) versus host-seeking behavioural
      responses. Sixteen to eighteen hours of starvation did not alter Ac-qtc
      expression in both sexes, however, blood feeding significantly modulated its
      response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not be involved
      in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally, a dual behavioural
      and molecular assay indicated that natural dysregulation of Ac-qtc in the late
      evening might promote the mating events for successful insemination. We
      hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play a unique role to regulate the sex-specific
      conflicting demand of mosquito courtship behaviour versus blood feeding behaviour
      in the adult female mosquitoes. Further elucidation of this molecular mechanism
      may provide further information to evaluate Ac-qtc as a key molecular target for 
      mosquito-borne disease management.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acaricidal, pediculicidal and
      larvicidal effect of synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using
      Momordica charantia leaf extract against the larvae of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) 
      microplus, adult of Pediculus humanus capitis, and the larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus. The ZnO NPs were characterized by using UV,
      XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDX. The SEM image confirms that the synthesized nanoparticles 
      were spherical in shape with a size of 21.32 nm. The results of GC-MS analysis
      indicates the presence of the major compound of Nonacosane (C29H60) in the M.
      charantia leaf extract. Cattle tick, head lice and mosquito larvae were exposed
      to a varying concentrations of the synthesized ZnO NPs and M. charantia leaf
      extract for 24 h. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract, biosynthesized ZnO NPs
      showed higher toxicity against R. microplus, P. humanus capitis, An. stephensi,
      and Cx. Quinquefasciatus with the LC50 values of 6.87, 14.38, 5.42, and 4.87
      mg/L, respectively. The findings revealed that synthesized ZnO NPs possess
      excellent anti-parasitic activity. These results suggest that the green
      synthesized ZnO NPs has the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach
      for the control of R. microplus, P. humanus capitis and the mosquito larvae of
      An. Stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Morphometric and morphological appraisal of the eggs of Anopheles stephensi
      (Diptera: Culicidae) from India.
PG  - 151-156
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles stephensi is one of the most important urban
      malaria vectors in India and contribute about 12% of total malaria cases. An.
      stephensi has three ecological variants; type, intermediate and mysorensis that
      can be differentiated on the basis of differences in number of ridges on egg
      float and on the basis of spiracular indices. Because of its anthropophilic
      nature the 'type' form is an efficient malaria vector. In the present study, the 
      egg surface morphometry and morphology of An. stephensi 'type' form was studied
      and detail distinguish- ing characters were recorded for its correct
      identification. METHODS: Eggs of An. stephensi 'type' form were studied by
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after sputter- coating with gold. In total 23 
      egg characters were analysed morphologically and morphometrically, which included
      egg attributes, deck attributes, ventral tubercles, micropyle and float
      attributes. RESULTS: The dorsal surface of the egg of 'type' form was curved
      while the ventral surface was concave and both anterior and posterior ends were
      blunt. The average length and width of egg was 473.94 + 11.18 and 154.69 + 2.66
      mum respectively. The number of float ribs observed was 20.33 +/- 0.33. The
      maximum length of float was found to be 246.57 + 15.27 mum, whereas maximum width
      was 87.16 + 3.83 mum. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The present study has
      generated some important data which is specific to An. Stephensi 'type' form and 
      provided significant morphological and morphometric standards for its correct
      identification. This information could be useful in differentiation of An.
      stephensi 'type' form from other ecological forms of the same species as well as 
      other species of Anopheles.

TI  - Temporo-spatial distribution of insecticide-resistance in Indian malaria vectors 
      in the last quarter-century: Need for regular resistance monitoring and
      management.
PG  - 111-130
AB  - The Indian vector control programme similar to other programmes in the world is
      still reliant on chemical insecticides. Anopheles culicifacies is the major
      vector out of six primary malaria vectors in India and alone contributes about
      2/3 malaria cases annually; and per se its control is actually control of malaria
      in India. For effective management of vectors, current information on their
      susceptibility status to different insecticides is essential. In this review, an 
      attempt was made to compile and present the available data on the susceptibility 
      status of different malaria vector species in India from the last 2.5 decades.
      Literature search was conducted by different means mainly web and library search;
      susceptibility data was collated from 62 sources for the nine malaria vector
      species from 145 districts in 21 states and two union territories between 1991
      and 2016. Interpretation of the susceptibility/resistance status was made on
      basis of the recent WHO criteria. Comprehensive analysis of the data indicated
      that An. culicifacies, a major vector species was resistant to at least one
      insecticide in 70% (101/145) of the districts. It was reported mostly resistant
      to DDT and malathion whereas, its resistant status against deltamethrin varied
      across the districts. The major threat for the malaria control programmes is
      multiple-insecticide-resistance in An. culicifacies which needs immediate
      attention for resistance management in order to sustain the gains achieved so
      far, as the programmes have targeted malaria elimination by 2030.

TI  - Mosquito-Borne Diseases and Omics: Tissue-Restricted Expression and Alternative
      Splicing Revealed by Transcriptome Profiling of Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 488-497

AB  - Malaria is one of the most debilitating mosquito-borne diseases with high global 
      health burdens. While much of the research on malaria and mosquito-borne diseases
      is focused on Africa, Southeast Asia accounts for a sizable portion of the global
      burden of malaria. Moreover, about 50% of the Asian malaria incidence and deaths 
      have been from India. A promising development in this context is that the
      completion of genome sequence of Anopheles stephensi, a major malaria vector in
      Asia, offers new opportunities for global health innovation, including the
      progress in deciphering the vectorial ability of this mosquito species at a
      molecular level. Moving forward, tissue-based expression profiling would be the
      next obvious step in understanding gene functions of An. stephensi. We report in 
      this article, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth study on
      tissue-based transcriptomic profile of four important organs (midgut, Malpighian 
      tubules, fat body, and ovary) of adult female An. stephensi mosquitoes. In all,
      we identified over 20,000 transcripts corresponding to more than 12,000 gene loci
      from these four tissues. We present and discuss the tissue-based expression
      profiles of majority of annotated transcripts in An. stephensi genome, and the
      dynamics of their alternative splicing in these tissues, in this study. The
      domain-based Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts
      in each of the mosquito tissue indicated enrichment of transcripts with
      proteolytic activity in midgut; transporter activity in Malpighian tubules; cell 
      cycle, DNA replication, and repair activities in ovaries; and oxidoreductase
      activities in fat body. Tissue-based study of transcript expression and gene
      functions markedly enhances our understanding of this important malaria vector,
      and in turn, offers rationales for further studies on vectorial ability and
      identification of novel molecular targets to intercept malaria transmission.

      malaria-endemic region of Western India.
PG  - 284

AB  - BACKGROUND: In global efforts to track mosquito infectivity and parasite
      elimination, controlled mosquito-feeding experiments can help in understanding
      the dynamics of parasite development in vectors. Anopheles stephensi is often
      accepted as the major urban malaria vector that transmits Plasmodium in Goa and
      elsewhere in South Asia. However, much needs to be learned about the interactions
      of Plasmodium vivax with An. stephensi. As a component of the US NIH
      International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) for Malaria
      Evolution in South Asia (MESA), a series of membrane-feeding experiments with
      wild An. stephensi and P. vivax were carried out to better understand this
      vector-parasite interaction. METHODS: Wild An. stephensi larvae and pupae were
      collected from curing water in construction sites in the city of Ponda, Goa,
      India. The larvae and pupae were reared at the MESA ICEMR insectary within the
      National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) field unit in Goa until they
      emerged into adult mosquitoes. Blood for membrane-feeding experiments was
      obtained from malaria patients at the local Goa Medical College and Hospital who 
      volunteered for the study. Parasites were counted by Miller reticule technique
      and correlation between gametocytaemia/parasitaemia and successful mosquito
      infection was studied. RESULTS: A weak but significant correlation was found
      between patient blood gametocytaemia/parasitaemia and mosquito oocyst load. No
      correlation was observed between gametocytaemia/parasitaemia and oocyst infection
      rates, and between gametocyte sex ratio and oocyst load. When it came to
      development of the parasite in the mosquito, a strong positive correlation was
      observed between oocyst midgut levels and sporozoite infection rates, and between
      oocyst levels and salivary gland sporozoite loads. Kinetic studies showed that
      sporozoites appeared in the salivary gland as early as day 7, post-infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in India to carry out membrane-feeding
      experiments with wild An. stephensi and P. vivax. A wide range of mosquito
      infection loads and infection rates were observed, pointing to a strong interplay
      between parasite, vector and human factors. Most of the present observations are 
      in agreement with feeding experiments conducted with P. vivax elsewhere in the
      world.

AB  - Growing concern on the application of synthetic mosquito repellents in the recent
      years has instigated the identification and development of better alternatives to
      control different mosquito-borne diseases. In view of above, present
      investigation evaluates the repellent activity of ethyl anthranilate (EA), a
      non-toxic, FDA approved volatile food additive against three known mosquito
      vectors namely, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus
      under laboratory conditions following standard protocols. Three concentration
      levels (2%, 5% and 10% w/v) of EA were tested against all the three selected
      mosquito species employing K & D module and arm-in-cage method to determine the
      effective dose (ED50) and complete protection time (CPT), respectively. The
      repellent activity of EA was further investigated by modified arm-in-cage method 
      to determine the protection over extended spatial ranges against all mosquito
      species. All behavioural situations were compared with the well-documented
      repellent N,N-diethylphenyl acetamide (DEPA) as a positive control. The findings 
      demonstrated that EA exhibited significant repellent activity against all the
      three mosquitoes species. The ED50 values of EA, against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus were found to be 0.96%, 5.4% and 3.6% w/v,
      respectively. At the concentration of 10% w/v, it provided CPTs of 60, 60 and
      30min, respectively, against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Again in spatial repellency evaluation, EA was found
      to be extremely effective in repelling all the three tested species of
      mosquitoes. Ethyl anthranilate provided comparable results to standard repellent 
      DEPA during the study. Results have concluded that the currently evaluated
      chemical, EA has potential repellent activity against some well established
      mosquito vectors. The study emphasizes that repellent activity of EA could be
      exploited for developing effective, eco-friendly, acceptable and safer
      alternative to the existing harmful repellents for personal protection against
      different hematophagous mosquito species.

AB  - The marine soil samples were collected from different locations of Parangipettai 
      mangrove ecosystem, Vellar estuary, southeast coast of India. Totally 30
      different marine actinobacteria were isolated by serial dilution plate technique 
      on starch casein agar medium. The isolated actinobacteria were investigated for
      their larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi
      mosquitoes. Streptomyces fungicidicus, S. griseus, S. albus, S. alboflavus and S.
      rochei were identified as potential biocide producers. Based on the antimicrobial
      activity, five strains were chosen for larvicidal and pupicidal activity. Among
      the crude extracts tested, the S. alboflavus extract showed significant activity 
      against Ae. aegypti (LC50 1.48 +/- 0.09 and LC90 3.33 +/- 0.22) and An. stephensi
      (LC50 1.30 +/- 0.09 and LC90 3.13 +/- 0.21). Five isolates have shown a most
      significant mortality rate of the Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi mosquito larvae. 
      This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of Japanese encephalitis
      vectors, Ae. aegypti and malarial vector An. stephensi.

TI  - Molecular modelling studies of kdr mutations in voltage gated sodium channel
      revealed significant conformational variations contributing to insecticide
      resistance.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - Voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC) of mosquito vectors are the primary targets 
      of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and other synthetic pyrethroids used in 
      public health programmes. The knockdown resistant (kdr) mutations in VGSC are
      associated with the insecticide resistance especially in Anophelines. The present
      study is aimed to emphasize and demarcate the impact of three kdr-mutations such 
      as L1014S, L1014F and L1014H on insecticide resistance. The membrane model of
      sodium transport domain of VGSC (STD-VGSC) was constructed using de novo approach
      based on domain and trans-membrane predictions. The comparative molecular
      modelling studies of wild type and mutant models of STD-VGSC revealed that L1014F
      mutant was observed to be near native to the wild type model in all the respects,
      but, L1014S and L1014H mutations showed drastic variations in the energy levels, 
      root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) that resulted in conformational variations. 
      The predicted binding sites also showed variable cavity volumes and RMSF in
      L1014S and L1014H mutants. Further, DDT also found be bound in near native manner
      to wild type in L1014F mutant and with variable orientation and affinities in
      L1014S and L1014H mutants. The variations and fluctuations observed in mutant
      structures explained that each mutation has its specific impact on the
      conformation of VGSC and its binding with DDT. The study provides new insights
      into the structure-function-correlations of mutant STD-VGSC structures and
      demonstrates the role and effects of kdr mutations on insecticide resistance in
      mosquito vectors.

TI  - Molecular characterization of indigenous Bacillus thuringiensis strains isolated 
      from Kashmir valley.
PG  - 143

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) being an eco-friendly bioinsecticide is effectively
      used in pest management strategies and, therefore, isolation and identification
      of new strains effective against a broad range of target pests is important. In
      the present study, new indigenous B. thuringiensis strains were isolated and
      investigated so that these could be used as an alternative and/or support the
      current commercial strains/cry proteins in use. For this, 159 samples including
      soil, leaf and spider webs were collected from ten districts of Kashmir valley
      (India). Of 1447 bacterial strains screened, 68 Bt strains were identified with 4
      types of crystalline inclusions. Crystal morphology ranking among the Bt strains 
      was spherical (69.11%) > spore attached (8.82%) > rod (5.88%) = bipyramidal
      (5.88%) > spherical plus rod (4.41%) > spherical plus bipyramidal (2.94%) =
      cuboidal (2.94%). SDS-PAGE investigation of the spore-crystal mixture
      demonstrated Bt strains contained proteins of various molecular weights ranging
      from 150 to 28 kDa. Insecticidal activity of the 68 indigenous Bt strains against
      Spodoptera litura neonates showed that Bt strain SWK1 strain had the highest
      mortality. Lepidopteron active genes (cry1, cry2Ab, cry2Ab) were present in six
      Bt strains. Further, analysis of a full-length cry2A gene (~1.9 kb) by PCR-RFLP
      in strain SWK1 revealed that it was a new cry2A gene in Bt strain SWK1 and was
      named as cry2Al1 (GenBank Accession No. KJ149819.1) using the Bt toxin
      nomenclature ( http://www.btnomenclature.info ). Insect bioassays with neonate
      larvae of S. litura and H. armigera showed that the purified Cry2Al1 is toxic to 
      S. litura with LC50 2.448 microg/ml and H. armigera with LC50 3.374 microg/ml,
      respectively. However, it did not produce any mortality in third instar larvae of
      Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi larvae/pupae
      insects (100 microg/ml) at 28 +/- 2 degrees C and 75 to 85% relative humidity
      under a photoperiod of 14L:10D.

TI  - Eco-friendly and cost-effective Ag nanocrystals fabricated using the leaf extract
      of Habenaria plantaginea: toxicity on six mosquito vectors and four non-target
      species.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-9203-2 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the biofabrication of metal nanoparticles has gained wide interest
      owing to its inherent features such as swift, simplicity, eco-friendliness, and
      cheaper costs. Different green-reducing agents led to the production of
      nanoparticles with varying toxicity on insects. In the current study, silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) were successfully synthesized using Habenaria plantaginea
      leaf extract. Ag nanoparticles were studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis),
      X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic
      force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with
      energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
      H. plantaginea extract and AgNPs were tested for mosquito larvicidal activity on 
      Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, An. subpictus, Ae.
      albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. LC50 values were 102.51, 111.99, 123.47,
      123.96, 136.56, 149.42 mug/ml and 12.23, 13.38, 14.78, 14.37, 15.39, 16.89
      mug/ml, respectively. Moreover, H. plantaginea aqueous extract and AgNPs were
      tested against the non-target species Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus,
      Poecilia reticulata, and Gambusia affinis obtaining LC50 values ranging from
      831.82 to 36,212.67 mug/ml. Overall, this study showed the effectiveness of H.
      plantaginea-fabricated nanoparticles on a wide range of important mosquito
      vectors, highlighting their scarce toxicity on four natural enemies predating
      mosquito larvae and pupae.

      four aquatic mosquito predators.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-9093-3 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many pathogens and parasites, 
      which cause serious diseases in humans and animals. Currently, botanical products
      have been suggested as alternative tools in the fight against arthropod vectors. 
      In this study, the essential oil (EO) extracted from Zingiber cernuum was tested 
      as larvicide and oviposition deterrent on six mosquito species of public health
      relevance, including malaria and Zika virus vectors. The EO showed high toxicity 
      on third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi (LC50 = 41.34 mug/ml), Aedes
      aegypti (LC50 = 44.88 mug/ml), Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 48.44 mug/ml),
      Anopheles subpictus (LC50 = 51.42 mug/ml), Aedes albopictus (LC50 = 55.84
      mug/ml), and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 = 60.20 mug/ml). In addition, low
      doses of Z. cernuum EO reduced oviposition rates in six mosquito species. The
      acute toxicity of Z. cernuum EO on four mosquito predators was scarce; LC50
      ranged from 3119 to 11,233 mug/ml. Overall, our results revealed that the Z.
      cernuum EO can be considered for the development of effective and
      environmental-friendly mosquito larvicides and oviposition deterrents.

AB  - Currently, nano-formulated mosquito larvicides have been widely proposed to
      control young instars of malaria vector populations. However, the fate of
      nanoparticles in the aquatic environment is scarcely known, with special
      reference to the impact of nanoparticles on enzymatic activity of non-target
      aquatic invertebrates. In this study, we synthesized CdS nanoparticles using a
      green protocol relying on the cheap extract of Valoniopsis pachynema algae. CdS
      nanoparticles showed high toxicity on young instars of the malaria vectors
      Anopheles stephensi and A. sundaicus. The antimalarial activity of the
      nano-synthesized product against chloroquine-resistant (CQ-r) Plasmodium
      falciparum parasites was investigated. From a non-target perspective, we focused 
      on the impact of this novel nano-pesticide on antioxidant enzymes
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities of the
      mud crab Scylla serrata. The characterization of nanomaterials was carried out by
      UV-vis and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as SEM and XRD analyses. In mosquitocidal
      assays, LC50 of V. pachynema-synthesized CdS nanoparticles on A. stephensi ranged
      from 16.856 (larva I), to 30.301mug/ml (pupa), while for An. sundaicus they
      ranged from 13.584 to 22.496mug/ml. The antiplasmodial activity of V. pachynema
      extract and CdS nanoparticles was evaluated against CQ-r and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) 
      strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of V. pachynema extract was 58.1mug/ml
      (CQ-s) and 71.46mug/ml (CQ-r), while nano-CdS IC50 was 76.14mug/ml (CQ-s) and
      89.21mug/ml (CQ-r). In enzymatic assays, S. serrata crabs were exposed to
      sub-lethal concentrations, i.e. 4, 6 and 8mug/ml of CdS nanoparticles, assessing 
      changes in GST and AChE activity after 16days. We observed significantly higher
      activity of GST, if compared to the control, during the whole experiment period. 
      In addition, a single treatment with CdS nanoparticles led to a significant
      decrease in AChE activity over time. The toxicity of CdS nanoparticles and Cd
      ions in aqueous solution was also assessed in mud crabs, showing higher toxicity 
      of aqueous Cd ions if compared to nano-CdS. Overall, our results underlined the
      efficacy of green-synthesized CdS nanoparticles in malaria vector control,
      outlining also significant impacts on the enzymatic activity of non-target
      aquatic organisms, with special reference to mud crabs.

TI  - Malaria epidemiology in an area of stable transmission in tribal population of
      Jharkhand, India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains an important health problem in India with
      approximately 1 million cases in 2014. Of these, 7% occurred in the Jharkhand
      state mainly in the tribal population. METHODS: This study was conducted in
      Dumargarhi, a tribal village about 42 km east of Ranchi city, Jharkhand, from May
      2014 to September 2016. Four point prevalence surveys were carried out during
      consecutive high (October-December) and low (June-August) transmission seasons.
      Malaria cases were recorded from April 2015 to April 2016 through fortnightly
      visits to the village. Adult mosquito densities were monitored fortnightly by
      manual catching using suction tube method. RESULTS: The study area consists of
      five hamlets inhabited by 945 individuals living in 164 households as recorded
      through a house-to-house census survey performed at enrollment. The study
      population consisted predominantly of the Munda (n = 425, 45%) and Oraon (n =
      217, 23%) ethnic groups. Study participants were categorized as per their age
      0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and >15 years. There were 99 cases of clinical malaria from
      April 2015 to April 2016 and all malaria cases confirmed by microscopy were
      attributed to Plasmodium falciparum (94 cases) and Plasmodium vivax (5 cases),
      respectively. During the high transmission season the mean density of P.
      falciparum parasitaemia per age group increased to a peak level of 23,601
      parasites/mul in the 6-10 years age group and gradually declined in the adult
      population. Malaria attack rates, parasite prevalence and density levels in the
      study population showed a gradual decrease with increasing age. This finding is
      consistent with the phenomenon of naturally acquired immunity against malaria.
      Three vector species were detected: Anopheles fluviatilis, Anopheles annularis,
      and Anopheles culicifacies. The incoherence or complete out of phase pattern of
      the vector density peaks together with a high prevalence of parasite positive
      individuals in the study population explains the year-round malaria transmission 
      in the study region. CONCLUSIONS: The collection of clinical data from a
      well-characterized tribal cohort from Jharkhand, India, has provided evidence for
      naturally acquired immunity against malaria in this hyperendemic region. The
      study also suggests that enforcement of existing control programmes can reduce
      the malaria burden further.

      vitro.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-2157-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to identify new ways to prevent transmission of vector-borne
      diseases such as malaria, efforts have been made to understand how insects are
      attracted to humans. Vector-host interaction studies have shown that several
      volatile compounds play an important role in attracting mosquitoes to human
      targets. A headspace solid-phase micro-extraction/gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (HSPME GC-MS) analysis of the volatile organic composition of
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) and supernatants of ultracentrifugation (SNUs) was
      carried out in Plasmodium falciparum-infected cultures with high and low
      parasitemias. RESULTS: A list of 18 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was
      obtained from the EVs of both infected and uninfected RBCs with
      1,2,3-Propanetriol, diacetate (diacetin) increased in the infected EVs,
      regardless of the parasitemia of the culture. The supernatant analysis, however, 
      gave off 56 VOCs, with pentane 2,2,4-trimethyl being present in all the SNUs of
      uninfected erythrocytes but absent from the parasite-infected ones. Standing out 
      in this study was hexanal, a reported insect attractant, which was the only VOC
      present in all samples from SNUs from infected erythrocytes and absent from
      uninfected ones, suggesting that it originates during parasite infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: The hexanal compound, reportedly a low-level component found in
      healthy human samples such as breath and plasma, had not been found in previous
      analyses of P. falciparum-infected patients or cultures. This compound has been
      reported as an Anopheles gambiae attractant in plants. While the compound could
      be produced during infection by the malaria parasite in human erythrocytes, the
      A. gambiae attraction could be used by the parasite as a strategy for
      transmission.

AB  - Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases, which has become a great
      public health problem all over the world. Ineffectiveness of available
      antimalarial treatment is the main reason behind its menace. The failure of
      current treatment strategies is due to emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium
      falciparum and drug toxicity in human beings. Therefore, the development of novel
      and effective antimalarial drugs is the need of the hour. Considering the huge
      biomedical applications of nanotechnology, it can be potentially used for the
      malarial treatment. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have demonstrated significant
      activity against malarial parasite (P. falciparum) and vector (female Anopheles
      mosquito). It is believed that AgNPs will be a solution for the control of
      malaria. This review emphasizes the pros- and cons of existing antimalarial
      treatments and in depth discussion on application of AgNPs for treatment of
      malaria. The role of nanoparticles for site specific drug delivery and
      toxicological issues have also been discussed.

TI  - Molecular identification of Plasmodium spp. and blood meal sources of anophelines
      in environmental reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of Maranhao, Brazil.
PG  - 203
LID - 10.1186/s13071-017-2133-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the diversity of feeding habits that females of some
      species of anophelines present, it is important to understand which vertebrates
      are part of blood food sources and how important is the role of each in the
      ecoepidemiology of malaria. There are many vector species for Plasmodium spp. in 
      the State of Maranhao, Brazil. In Sao Luis Island, Anopheles aquasalis is the
      main vector for human malaria; this species is abundant in areas with primates
      that are positive for Plasmodium. Anopheles aquasalis has natural exophilic and
      zoophilic feeding behavior, but in cases of high density and absence of animals, 
      presents quite varied behavior, and feeds on human blood. In this context, the
      objective of the present study was to identify Plasmodium spp. and the blood meal
      sources of anophelines in two environmental reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of
      Maranhao, using molecular methods. METHODS: Between June and July 2013, female
      anophelines were collected in the Sitio Aguahy Private Reserve, in the
      municipality of Sao Jose de Ribamar, and in the Sitio Mangalho Reserve, located
      within the Maracana Environmental Protection Area, in the municipality of Sao
      Luis. CDC-type light traps, Shannon traps and protected human bait were used
      during three consecutive hours in peridomestic and wooded areas. Pools of
      anophelines were formed using mosquitoes of the same species that had been caught
      at the same site on the same date. A genus-specific amplification protocol based 
      on the 18S rRNA gene was used for qPCR and cPCR. RESULTS: A total of 416
      anophelines were collected, of the following species: An. aquasalis (399), An.
      mediopunctatus (3), An. shannoni (1), An. nuneztovari (sensu lato) (1), An.
      goeldii (1), An. evansae (2) and An. (Nyssorhynchus) sp. (9), comprising 54
      pools. Two pools were positive for Plasmodium (2/54) based on the 18S rRNA gene. 
      In the phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method, based on a 240 
      bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, it was found that the sequences of Plasmodium
      sp. amplified from pools of An. aquasalis (pool 2) and An. nuneztovari (s.l.)
      (pool 10) were phylogenetically related to a clade of P. falciparum isolates from
      India, and to a clade of Plasmodium sp. isolates from psittacines in Brazil,
      respectively. Cat, dog and human DNA were identified in the blood meals of the
      anophelines sampled. CONCLUSION: The species An. aquasalis was the most abundant 
      anopheline species in Sao Luis Island. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected, thus
      confirming the importance of this species as the main vector on Sao Luis Island, 
      Brazil. In addition, the presence of An. nuneztovari (s.l.) with DNA positive for
      Plasmodium spp. confirms its importance as a secondary vector.

TI  - Apolipophorin-III Acts as a Positive Regulator of Plasmodium Development in
      Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2017.00185 [doi]
AB  - Apolipophorin III (ApoLp-III) is a well-known hemolymph protein having a
      functional role in lipid transport and immune responses of insects. Here we
      report the molecular and functional characterization of Anopheles stephensi
      Apolipophorin-III (AsApoLp-III) gene. This gene consists of 679 nucleotides
      arranged into two exons of 45 and 540 bp that give an ORF encoding 194 amino acid
      residues. Excluding a putative signal peptide of the first 19 amino acid
      residues, the 175-residues in mature AsApoLp-III protein has a calculated
      molecular mass of 22 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the divergence of
      mosquitoes (Order Diptera) ApoLp-III from their counterparts in moths (Order:
      Lepidoptera). Also, it revealed a close relatedness of AsApoLp-III to ApoLp-III
      of An. gambiae. AsApoLp-III mRNA expression is strongly induced in Plasmodium
      berghei infected mosquito midguts suggesting its crucial role in parasite
      development. AsApoLp-III silencing decreased P. berghei oocysts numbers by 7.7
      fold against controls. These effects might be due to the interruption of
      AsApoLp-III mediated lipid delivery to the developing oocysts. In addition,
      nitric oxide synthase (NOS), an antiplasmodial gene, is also highly induced in
      AsApoLp-III silenced midguts suggesting that this gene acts like an agonist and
      protects Plasmodium against the mosquito immunity.

TI  - Bionomics of Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera:
      Culicidae) in Relation to Malaria Transmission in East-Central India.
PG  - 821-830
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjx065 [doi]
AB  - The southern districts of Odisha State in east-central India have been highly
      endemic for falciparum malaria for many decades. However, there is no adequate
      information on the abundance of the vector species or their bionomics in relation
      to space and time in these districts. Therefore, a study was carried out on the
      entomological aspects of malaria transmission to generate such information.
      Collections of mosquitoes were made once during each of the three seasons in 128 
      villages selected from eight districts. Villages within the foot-hill ecotype had
      a significantly greater abundance of Anopheles fluviatilis James s. l., whereas
      the abundance of Anopheles culicifacies Giles s. l. was significantly greater in 
      the plain ecotype. The abundance of An. fluviatilis was maximum during the cold
      season, whereas An. culicifacies abundance was highest during summer and rainy
      seasons. The maximum likelihood estimation of the malaria infection rate in An.
      fluviatilis was 1.78%, 6.05%, and 2.6% in Ganjam, Kalahandi, and Rayagada
      districts, respectively. The infection rate of An. culicifacies was 1.39% only in
      Kandhamal district; infected females were not detected elsewhere. Concurrently,
      the annual malaria parasite incidence (MPI) was significantly higher in hill-top 
      (17.6) and foot-hill (14.4) villages compared to plain villages (4.1). The
      districts with more villages in hill-top and foot-hill ecotypes also had a
      greater abundance of An. fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, and exhibited a
      higher incidence of malaria than villages within the plain ecotype, where An.
      culicifacies was the most abundant vector.

TI  - Fabrication of highly effective mosquito nanolarvicides using an Asian plant of
      ethno-pharmacological interest, Priyangu (Aglaia elaeagnoidea): toxicity on
      non-target mosquito natural enemies.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8898-4 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes threaten the lives of humans, livestock, pets and wildlife around the 
      globe, due to their ability to vector devastating diseases. Aglaia elaeagnoidea, 
      commonly known as Priyangu, is widely employed in Asian traditional medicine and 
      pest control. Medicinal activities include anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
      anticancer, and anesthetic actions. Flavaglines, six cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, a 
      cyclopenta[bc]benzopyran, a benzo[b]oxepine, and an aromatic butyrolactone showed
      antifungal properties, and aglaroxin A and rocaglamide were effective to control 
      moth pests. Here, we determined the larvicidal action of A. elaeagnoidea leaf
      aqueous extract. Furthermore, we focused on Priyangu-mediated synthesis of Ag
      nanoparticles toxic to Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles
      stephensi. The plant extract and the nanolarvicide were tested on three mosquito 
      vectors, following the WHO protocol, as well as on three non-target mosquito
      predators. Priyangu-synthesized Ag nanoparticles were characterized by
      spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, XRD, and EDX) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, and TEM)
      analyses. Priyangu extract toxicity was moderate on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50
      246.43; LC90 462.09 mug/mL), Ae. aegypti (LC50 229.79; LC90 442.71 mug/mL), and
      An. stephensi (LC50 207.06; LC90 408.46 mug/mL), respectively, while
      Priyangu-synthesized Ag nanoparticles were highly toxic to Cx. quinquefasciatus
      (LC50 24.91; LC90 45.96 mug/mL), Ae. aegypti (LC50 22.80; LC90 43.23 mug/mL), and
      An. stephensi (LC50 20.66; LC90 39.94 mug/mL), respectively. Priyangu extract and
      Ag nanoparticles were found safer to non-target larvivorous fishes, backswimmers,
      and waterbugs, with LC50 ranging from 1247 to 37,254.45 mug/mL, if compared to
      target pests. Overall, the current research represents a modern approach
      integrating traditional botanical pesticides and nanotechnology to the control of
      larval populations of mosquito vectors, with negligible toxicity against
      non-target including larvivorous fishes, backswimmers, and waterbugs.

TI  - Curzerene, trans-beta-elemenone, and gamma-elemene as effective larvicides
      against Anopheles subpictus, Aedes albopictus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus:
      toxicity on non-target aquatic predators.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8822-y [doi]
AB  - A wide number of studies dealing with mosquito control focus on toxicity
      screenings of whole plant essential oils, while limited efforts shed light on
      main molecules responsible of toxicity, as well as their mechanisms of action on 
      non-target organisms. In this study, GC-MS shed light on main essential oil
      components extracted from leaves of the Suriname cherry Eugenia uniflora, i.e.,
      curzerene (35.7%), trans-beta-elemenone (11.5%), and gamma-elemene (13.6%),
      testing them on Anopheles subpictus, Aedes albopictus, and Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus larvae. Non-target toxicity experiments were carried out on
      four species of aquatic larvivorous organisms, including fishes, backswimmers,
      and waterbugs. The essential oil from E. uniflora leaves tested on An. subpictus,
      Ae. Albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus showed LC50 of 31.08, 33.50, and 36.35 
      mug/ml, respectively. Curzerene, trans-beta-elemenone, and gamma-elemene were
      extremely toxic to An. subpictus (LC50 = 4.14, 6.13, and 10.53 mug/ml), Ae.
      albopictus (LC50 = 4.57, 6.74, and 11.29 mug/ml), and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50
      = 5.01, 7.32, and 12.18 mug/ml). The essential oil from E. uniflora leaves,
      curzerene, trans-beta-elemenone, and gamma-elemene showed low toxicity to
      larvivorous fishes, backswimmers, and waterbugs, with LC50 ranging from 303.77 to
      6765.56 mug/ml. Predator safety factor (PSF) ranged from 55.72 to 273.45.
      Overall, we believe that curzerene isolated from the essential oil from E.
      uniflora leaves can represent an ideal molecule to formulate novel mosquito
      larvicides, due to its extremely low LC50 on all tested mosquito vectors
      (4.14-5.01 mug/ml), which far encompasses most of the botanical pesticides tested
      till now. Notably, the above-mentioned LC50 did not damage the four aquatic
      predators tested in this study.

TI  - Anopheles stephensi Heme Peroxidase HPX15 Suppresses Midgut Immunity to Support
      Plasmodium Development.
PG  - 249
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00249 [doi]
AB  - The heme peroxidase HPX15 is an evolutionary conserved anopheline
      lineage-specific gene. Previously, we found that this gene is present in the
      genome of 19 worldwide distributed different species of Anopheles mosquito and
      its orthologs are absent in other mosquitoes, insects, or human. In addition,
      65-99% amino acid identity among these 19 orthologs permitted us to hypothesize
      that the functional aspects of this gene might be also conserved in different
      anophelines. In this study, we found that Anopheles stephensi AsHPX15 gene is
      mainly expressed in the midgut and highly induced after uninfected or Plasmodium 
      berghei-infected blood feeding. RNA interference-mediated silencing of midgut
      AsHPX15 gene drastically reduced the number of developing P. berghei oocysts. An 
      antiplasmodial gene nitric oxide synthase was induced 13-fold in silenced midguts
      when compared to the unsilenced controls. Interestingly, the induction of
      antiplasmodial immunity in AsHPX15-silenced midguts is in absolute agreement with
      Anopheles gambiae. In A. gambiae, AgHPX15 catalyzes the formation of a dityrosine
      network at luminal side of the midgut that suppresses the activation of mosquito 
      immunity against the bolus bacteria. Thus, a low-immunity zone created by this
      mechanism indirectly supports Plasmodium development inside the midgut lumen.
      These indistinguishable functional behaviors and conserved homology indicates
      that HPX15 might be a potent target to manipulate the antiplasmodial immunity of 
      the anopheline midgut, and it will open new frontiers in the field of malaria
      control.

TI  - Development, standardization and validation of molecular techniques for malaria
      vector species identification, trophic preferences, and detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum.
PG  - 25-34
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Knowledge on prevalence of malaria vector species of a
      certain area provides important information for implementation of appropriate
      control strategies. The present study describes a rapid method for screening of
      major Anopheline vector species and at the same time detection of Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoite infection and blood meal preferences/trophic preferences.
      METHODS: The study was carried from February 2012 to March 2013 in three seasons,
      i.e. rainy, winter and summer in Jhumpura PHC of Keonjhar district, Odisha,
      India. Processing of mosquitoes was carried out in two different methods, viz.
      mosquito pool (P1) and mosquito DNA pool (P2). Pool size for both the methods was
      standardized for DNA isolation and multiplex PCR assay. This PCR based assay was 
      employed to screen the major vector com- position in three different seasons of
      four different ecotypes of Keonjhar district. Pearson's correlation coefficient
      was determined for a comparative analysis of the morphological identification
      with the pool prevalence assay for each ecotype. RESULTS: A pool size of 10 was
      standardized for DNA isolation as well as PCR. PCR assay revealed that the
      average pool prevalence for all ecotypes was highest for An. annularis in winter 
      and summer whereas for An. culicifacies it was rainy season. Foothill and plain
      ecotypes contributed to highest and lowest vectorial abundance respectively. The 
      results of the prevalence of vector species in pool from PCR based assay were
      found to be highly correlated with that of the results of morphological
      identification. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Screening by pool based PCR assay is
      relatively rapid as compared to conventional identification and can be employed
      as an important tool in malaria control programmes.

TI  - Boswellia ovalifoliolata (Burseraceae) essential oil as an eco-friendly
      larvicide? Toxicity against six mosquito vectors of public health importance,
      non-target mosquito fishes, backswimmers, and water bugs.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8820-0 [doi]
AB  - The use of synthetic pesticides to control vector populations is detrimental to
      human health and the environment and may lead to the development of resistant
      strains. Plants can be alternative sources of safer compounds effective on
      mosquito vectors. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal activity of Boswellia
      ovalifoliolata leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against Anopheles stephensi,
      Anopheles subpictus, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus, and
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus. GC-MS revealed that the B. ovalifoliolata EO contained
      at least 20 compounds. The main constituents were beta-pinene, alpha-terpineol,
      and caryophyllene. In acute toxicity assays, the EO was toxic to larvae of An.
      stephensi, Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. subpictus, Ae. albopictus, and 
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus with LC50 values of 61.84, 66.24, 72.47, 82.26, 89.80, and 
      97.95 mug/ml, respectively. B. ovalifoliolata EO was scarcely toxic to mosquito
      fishes, backswimmers, and water bugs predating mosquito larvae with LC50 from
      4186 to 14,783 mug/ml. Overall, these results contribute to develop effective and
      affordable instruments to magnify the reliability of Culicidae control programs.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of phytosteroid compounds from leaf extract of Solanum nigrum
      against Culex vishnui group and Anopheles subpictus.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.1186/s13104-017-2460-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector control is facing a menace due to the appearance of resistance
      to synthetic insecticides. Insecticides of plant origin may provide appropriate
      substitute biocontrol techniques in the future. The present study was carried out
      to investigate the bio control potentiality of active ingredient isolated from
      chloroform: methanol (1:1 v/v) extract of mature leaves of Solanum nigrum L.
      (Solanaceae) against early 3rd instar larvae of Culex vishnui group (comprising
      of Cx. vishnui Theobald, Cx. pseudovishnui Colless and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus
      Giles) and Anopheles subpictus Grassi. S. nigrum is a common plant distributed in
      many parts of India with medicinal properties. METHODS: Bioactive compound
      isolated from chloroform: methanol (1:1 v/v) extract of mature leaves of S.
      nigrum was (25, 45, 60 mg/L) tested against early 3rd instar larvae of Cx.
      vishnui group and An. subpictus. The lethal concentration was determined by log
      probit analysis. The chemical nature of the active substance was also evaluated
      following gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and infrared (IR)
      analysis. The compound was also studied on non target organisms such as Daphnia
      sp. and Diplonychus annulatum. RESULTS: TLC spot having Rf value of 0.94 (Rf =
      14.1/15 = 0.94) showed larvicidal activity. In a 72 h bioassay experiment,
      mortality rate at 60 mg/L was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those at 25
      and 45 mg/L against early 3rd instar. Result of log-probit analysis (at 95%
      confidence level) revealed that LC50 and LC90 values gradually decreased with the
      exposure period showing the lowest value at 72 h of exposure. A clear
      dose-dependent mortality was observed, as the rate of mortality (Y) was
      positively correlated with the concentration (X) having regression coefficient
      value close to one in each case. The compound was found to be eco-friendly as it 
      did not show any adverse effect to the studied non target organisms. Chemical
      characterization (GC-MS and IR analyses) of the active ingredient revealed the
      presence of phytosteroid compounds responsible for mosquito larvicidal activity. 
      CONCLUSION: Leaf extract of S. nigrum has great potential as bio control agent
      against Cx. vishnui group and An. subpictus. In near future the isolated
      bioactive phytochemical could be used as a source of an effective mosquitocidal
      agent.

TI  - Effect of meteorological variables on Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum 
      malaria in outbreak prone districts of Rajasthan, India.
LID - S1876-0341(17)30064-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jiph.2017.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a public health problem caused by Plasmodium parasite and 
      transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. Arid and semi-arid regions of western India
      are prone to malaria outbreaks. Malaria outbreak prone districts viz. Bikaner,
      Barmer and Jodhpur were selected to study the effect of meteorological variables 
      on Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria outbreaks for the period of
      2009-2012. METHOD: The data of monthly malaria cases and meteorological variables
      was analysed using SPSS 20v. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to
      examine the strength of the relationship between meteorological variables, P.
      vivax and P. falciparum malaria cases. Pearson's correlation analysis was carried
      out among the meteorological variables to observe the independent effect of each 
      independent variable on the outcome. RESULTS: Results indicate that malaria
      outbreaks have occurred in Bikaner and Barmer due to continuous rains for more
      than two months. Rainfall has shown to be an important predictor of malaria
      outbreaks in Rajasthan. P. vivax is more significantly correlated with rainfall, 
      minimum temperature (P<0.01) and less significantly with relative humidity
      (P<0.05); whereas P. falciparum is significantly correlated with rainfall,
      relative humidity (P<0.01) and less significantly with temperature (P<0.05). The 
      determination of the lag period for P. vivax is relative humidity and for P.
      falciparum is temperature. The lag period between malaria cases and rainfall is
      shorter for P. vivax than P. falciparum. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the knowledge
      generated is not only useful to take prompt malaria control interventions but
      also helpful to develop better forecasting model in outbreak prone regions.

TI  - Resting and feeding preferences of Anopheles stephensi in an urban setting,
      perennial for malaria.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1764-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Indian city of Chennai is endemic for malaria and the known local
      malaria vector is Anopheles stephensi. Plasmodium vivax is the predominant
      malaria parasite species, though Plasmodium falciparum is present at low levels. 
      The urban ecotype of malaria prevails in Chennai with perennial transmission
      despite vector surveillance by the Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS) of the National
      Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). Understanding the feeding and
      resting preferences, together with the transmission potential of adult vectors in
      the area is essential in effective planning and execution of improved vector
      control measures. METHODS: A yearlong survey was carried out in cattle sheds and 
      human dwellings to check the resting, feeding preferences and transmission
      potential of An. stephensi. The gonotrophic status, age structure, resting and
      host seeking preferences were studied. The infection rate in An. stephensi and
      Anopheles subpictus were analysed by circumsporozoite ELISA (CS-ELISA). RESULTS: 
      Adult vectors were found more frequently and at higher densities in cattle sheds 
      than human dwellings. The overall Human Blood Index (HBI) was 0.009 indicating
      the vectors to be strongly zoophilic. Among the vectors collected from human
      dwellings, 94.2% were from thatched structures and the remaining 5.8% from tiled 
      and asbestos structures. 57.75% of the dissected vectors were nulliparous
      whereas, 35.83% were monoparous and the rest 6.42% biparous. Sporozoite
      positivity rate was 0.55% (4/720) and 1.92% (1/52) for An. stephensi collected
      from cattle sheds and human dwellings, respectively. One adult An. subpictus
      (1/155) was also found to be infected with P. falciparum. CONCLUSIONS: Control of
      the adult vector populations can be successful only by understanding the resting 
      and feeding preferences. The present study indicates that adult vectors
      predominantly feed on cattle and cattle sheds are the preferred resting place,
      possibly due to easy availability of blood meal source and lack of any
      insecticide or repellent pressure. Hence targeting these resting sites with cost 
      effective, socially acceptable intervention tools, together with effective larval
      source management to reduce vector breeding, could provide an improved integrated
      vector management strategy to help drive down malaria transmission and assist in 
      India's plan to eliminate malaria by 2030.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subclinical (asymptomatic) cases of malaria could be a major barrier 
      to the success of malaria elimination programs. This study has evaluated the
      impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) on the prevalence of subclinical
      malaria in the presence of pyrethroid resistance in the main malaria vector
      Anopheles culicifacies on malaria transmission among a cohort of children in
      villages of the Keshkal sub-district in Chhattisgarh state. METHODS: A cohort of 
      6582 children ages less than 14 years was enrolled from 80 study clusters. Post
      monsoon survey was carried out at baseline before LLIN distribution, and 5862
      children were followed up in the subsequent year. Study outcomes included
      assessment of subclinical malarial infections and use of LLINs among the study
      cohort in the presence of varied levels of pyrethroid resistance. FINDINGS: In
      the baseline survey, the proportion of subclinical malaria was 6.1%. LLIN use
      during the previous night was 94.8%. Overall, prevalence of subclinical malaria
      was significantly reduced to 1% (p<0.001) in the second survey. LLIN users were
      protected from malaria (OR: 0.25, 95% CI=0.12-0.52, p<0.001) and subclinical
      malaria (OR: 0.25, 95% CI=0.11-0.58, p=0.001) despite the presence of pyrethroid 
      resistance in the study area. INTERPRETATION: In this low transmission area,
      sleeping under LLINs significantly reduced the burden of malaria among children. 
      In the presence of pyrethroid resistant malaria vector, a high LLIN use of 94.5% 
      was observed to have significantly brought down the proportion of subclinical
      malaria among the cohort children.

AB  - Plasmodium aspartic proteases, termed plasmepsins (PMs) play many critical roles 
      such as haemoglobin degradation, cleavage of PEXEL proteins and sporozoite
      development in the parasite life cycle. Most of the plasmepsins are well
      characterized, however the role of PM VIII in Plasmodium remains unknown. Here,
      we elucidate the functions of PM VIII (PBANKA_132910) in the rodent malaria
      parasite Plasmodium berghei (Pb). By targeted gene deletion, we show that PbPM
      VIII is critical for sporozoite egress from an oocyst and gliding motility, which
      is a prerequisite for the invasion of salivary glands and subsequent transmission
      to the vertebrate host.

AB  - In 2005, Lacroix et al. demonstrated that infected humans are more attractive to 
      mosquitoes, a phenomenon known as the vector-bias effect. The aim of this study
      was to determine how a vector-bias effect affects the changes in the dynamics of 
      malaria transmission, and the changes in control strategies and
      cost-effectiveness for optimal control considering the regional characteristics
      or force of infections for different transmission rates. We used a vector-bias
      mathematical model and considered two different incidence areas: a high
      transmission area and a low transmission area. Our results showed that the
      dynamics in the two areas differed; as bias exists and the strategy for optimal
      control could be changed in the different areas. Thus, this work may give that
      considering the vector-bias effect in different areas facilitates prediction of
      the future dynamics and make decisions for establishing controls. We also mention
      the evolution of malaria parasites in this study.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of Blumea eriantha essential oil and its components against
      six mosquito species, including Zika virus vectors: the promising potential of
      (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene, carvotanacetone and dodecyl acetate.

AB  - The effective and environmentally sustainable control of mosquitoes is a
      challenge of essential importance. This is due to the fact that some invasive
      mosquitoes, with special reference to the Aedes genus, are particularly difficult
      to control, due to their high ecological plasticity. Moreover, the indiscriminate
      overuse of synthetic insecticides resulted in undesirable effects on human health
      and non-target organisms, as well as resistance development in targeted vectors. 
      Here, the leaf essential oil (EO) extracted from a scarcely studied plant of
      ethno-medicinal interest, Blumea eriantha (Asteraceae), was tested on the larvae 
      of six mosquitoes, including Zika virus vectors. The B. eriantha EO was analyzed 
      by GC and GC-MS. The B. eriantha EO showed high toxicity against 3rd instar
      larvae of six important mosquito species: Anopheles stephensi (LC50=41.61
      mug/ml), Aedes aegypti (LC50=44.82 mug/ml), Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 =48.92
      mug/ml), Anopheles subpictus (LC50=51.21 mug/ml), Ae. albopictus (LC50=56.33
      mug/ml) and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (LC50=61.33 mug/ml). The major components
      found in B. eriantha EO were (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene (12.8%), carvotanacetone
      (10.6%), and dodecyl acetate (8.9%). Interestingly, two of the main EO
      components, (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene and carvotanacetone, achieved LC50 lower than 10
      mug/ml on all tested mosquito species. The acute toxicity of B. eriantha EO and
      its major constituents on four aquatic predators of mosquito larval instars was
      limited, with LC50 ranging from 519 to 11.431 mug/ml. Overall, the larvicidal
      activity of (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene and carvotanacetone far exceed most of the LC50 
      calculated in current literature on mosquito botanical larvicides, allowing us to
      propose both of them as potentially alternatives for developing eco-friendly
      mosquito control tools.

TI  - Biophysical characterization of Acacia caesia-fabricated silver nanoparticles:
      effectiveness on mosquito vectors of public health relevance and impact on
      non-target aquatic biocontrol agents.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8482-y [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases lead to serious public health concerns in tropical and
      sub-tropical countries worldwide, due to development of mosquito resistance to
      synthetic pesticides, non-target effects of pesticides, and socioeconomic
      reasons. Currently, green nanotechnology is a promising research field, showing a
      wide range of potential applications in vector control programs. The employ of
      natural products as reducing agents to fabricate insecticidal nanocomposites is
      gaining research attention worldwide, due to low costs and high effectiveness.
      Interestingly, biophysical features of green-synthesized nanoparticles strongly
      differ when different botanicals are employed for nanosynthesis. In this study, a
      cheap Acacia caesia leaf extract was employed to fabricate silver nanoparticles
      (Ag NPs) with ovicidal, larvicidal, and adulticidal toxicity against three
      mosquito vectors, Anopheles subpictus, Aedes albopictus, and Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus. Ag NPs were analyzed by various biophysical methods, including
      spectroscopy (UV-visible spectrophotometry, XRD, FTIR, EDX) and microscopy (SEM, 
      TEM, AFM) techniques. High acute larvicidal potential was observed against larvae
      of An. subpictus (LC50 = 10.33 mug/ml), Ae. albopictus (LC50 = 11.32 mug/ml), and
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 = 12.35 mug/ml). Ag NPs completely inhibited egg
      hatchability on three vectors at 60, 75, and 90 mug/ml, respectively. In
      adulticidal assays, LD50 values were 18.66, 20.94, and 22.63 mug/ml. If compared 
      to mosquito larvae, Ag NPs were safer to three non-target aquatic biocontrol
      agents, with LC50 ranging from 684 to 2245 mug/ml. Overall, our study highlights 
      the potential of A. caesia as an abundant and cheap bioresource to fabricate
      biogenic Ag NPs effective against mosquito young instars and adults, with
      moderate impact on non-target aquatic biocontrol agents.

TI  - Health Impact Assessment of Indira Sagar Project: a paramount to studies on Water
      Development Projects.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1688-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very limited studies on Health Impact Assessment (HIA) of Water
      Development Projects (WDP) in relation to mosquito-borne diseases have been
      carried out in India. The current study focuses on using HIA as a tool for
      finding impact of Indira Sagar Project, Madhya Pradesh on human health in
      relation to mosquito borne diseases, and emphasizing its incorporation as an
      integral part of any WDP. METHODS: Screening, scoping, assessment,
      recommendation, reporting, and evaluation were carried out in selected study
      areas. Entomological, epidemiological, socio-economic and knowledge, attitudes
      and practices data related to malaria transmission in three dam components:
      Submergence (SUB), Command (CMD) and Resettlement and Rehabilitation (RR)
      colonies were generated for the period of January 2013-December 2014. Statistical
      analysis was attempted to compare data among dam components and to identify risk 
      factors. Component-specific mitigation measures were suggested based on
      observations. RESULTS: Anopheles culicifacies was the dominating species in all
      three dam components and its man-hour density in CMD areas was higher compared to
      SUB and RR. The odds of finding a positive malaria case was much higher in CMD
      compared to SUB (OR 1.24, CI 95% 0.71-2.43) and RR (OR 5.48, CI 95% 0.73-40.63). 
      Respondents of CMD stated more previous episodes of malaria (81.8%) compared to
      RR (61.4%) and SUB (55.7%). The canonical discriminant analysis concluded that
      distance from reservoir/Indira Sagar canal had the highest discriminating ability
      of malaria cases in different components followed by treatment-seeking behaviour 
      and malaria history. The analysis identified these risk factors with 70%
      accuracy. CONCLUSION: Engineering manipulations may be carried out in CMD areas
      to control seepage and RR colonies should be established beyond 3 km from
      reservoir/Indira Sagar canal considering the flight range of A. culicifacies.
      Strengthening of surveillance with early detection and complete treatment was
      recommended for CMD areas. To avoid future transmission in other areas and
      projects HIA should be carried out at planning stage for planning better control 
      activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New brands of potential long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) and
      LLIN treatment kits require field evaluation before they are used in a vector
      control programme. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      bio-efficacy, usage, washing practice and physical integrity of nets treated with
      LLIN treatment kit, ICON MAXX in a phase III field trial in Odisha state, India. 
      METHODS: A total of 300 polyester nets treated with ICON MAXX and 140 polyester
      nets treated conventionally with lambda-cyhalothrin CS 2.5% ITNs were
      distributed. The bio-efficacy was evaluated with WHO cone bioassay. The chemical 
      analysis of netting pieces was done at the beginning, after 12 and 36 months of
      the trial. FINDINGS: After one year of distribution of nets, the bioassay showed 
      100% mortality on both ITNs and ICON MAXX treated nets. At 36 months, the overall
      pass rate was 58.8% and the mean lambda-cyhalothrin content of LLINs was 34.5 mg 
      ai/m2, showing a loss of 44.4% of the original concentration. CONCLUSION: ICON
      MAXX treated LLIN was found to retain bio-efficacy causing 97% knockdown of
      Anopheles stephensi up to 30 months and met the WHOPES criteria. However, the
      desired bio-efficacy was not sustained up to 36 months.

TI  - Increasing the potential for malaria elimination by targeting zoophilic vectors.
PG  - 40551
LID - 10.1038/srep40551 [doi]
AB  - Countries in the Asia Pacific region aim to eliminate malaria by 2030. A
      cornerstone of malaria elimination is the effective management of Anopheles
      mosquito vectors. Current control tools such as insecticide treated nets or
      indoor residual sprays target mosquitoes in human dwellings. We find in a high
      transmission region in India, malaria vector populations show a high propensity
      to feed on livestock (cattle) and rest in outdoor structures such as cattle
      shelters. We also find evidence for a shift in vector species complex towards
      increased zoophilic behavior in recent years. Using a malaria transmission model 
      we demonstrate that in such regions dominated by zoophilic vectors, existing
      vector control tactics will be insufficient to achieve elimination, even if
      maximized. However, by increasing mortality in the zoophilic cycle, the
      elimination threshold can be reached. Current national vector control policy in
      India restricts use of residual insecticide sprays to domestic dwellings. Our
      study suggests substantial benefits of extending the approach to treatment of
      cattle sheds, or deploying other tactics that target zoophilic behavior.
      Optimizing use of existing tools will be essential to achieving the ambitious
      2030 elimination target.

AB  - Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) interrupt malaria parasite transmission and 
      hence form an important component for malaria eradication. Mosquito midgut
      exopeptidases such as aminopeptidase N & carboxypeptidase B have demonstrated TBV
      potential. In the present study, we cloned and characterized carboxypeptidase A
      (CPA) from the midgut of an important malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi.
      ClustalW amino acid alignment and in silico 3-dimensional structure analysis of
      CPA predicted the presence of active sites involved in zinc and substrate binding
      that are conserved among all the known mosquito species. Real-time PCR analysis
      demonstrated that CPA is predominantly expressed in the midgut throughout the
      mosquito life cycle and that this gene is significantly elevated in P.
      berghei-infected mosquitoes compared to uninfected blood-fed controls. The high
      midgut CPA activity correlated with the prominent mRNA levels observed.
      Peptide-based anti-CPA antibodies were raised that cross-reacted specifically to 
      approximately 48kDa and approximately 37kDa bands, which correspond to zymogen
      and active forms of CPA. Further, the addition of CPA-directed antibodies to P.
      berghei-containing blood meal significantly reduced the mosquito infection rate
      in the test group compared to control and blocked the parasite development in the
      midgut. These results support further development of A. stephensi CPA as a
      candidate TBV.

TI  - Mapping of Malaria Vectors at District Level in India: Changing Scenario and
      Identified Gaps.
PG  - 91-98
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2016.2018 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is one of the six major vector-borne diseases in India, the endemicity of
      which changes with changes in ecological, climatic, and sociodevelopmental
      conditions. The anopheline vectors are greatly affected by ecological conditions 
      such as deforestation, urbanization, climate and lifestyle. Despite the advent of
      tools such as Geographic Information System (GIS), the updated information on the
      distribution of anopheline vectors of malaria is not available. In India, the
      plan for vector control is organized at subcentral level but information about
      vectors is unavailable even at the district level. Therefore, a systematic
      presentation of vector distribution has been made to provide maps in respect of
      major vector species. A search of the literature for major vector species, that
      is, Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles fluviatilis, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles
      minimus, and Anopheles dirus sensu lato, since 1927 till 2015 was carried out.
      Data have been presented as present, absent, and no information about vector
      species during pre-eradication (1927-1958), posteradication (1959-1999), and
      current scenario (2000-2015). Vectors' distribution and malaria endemicity were
      mapped using Arc GIS. Of 630 districts of India, major vectors An. culicifacies, 
      An. fluviatilis, and An. stephensi were present in 420, 241, and 243 districts,
      respectively. In 183 districts, there is no information on any major malaria
      vector species although 27 of them from the states of Arunachal Pradesh,
      Jharkhand, Manipur, and Mizoram are highly endemic for malaria, having incidences
      of 2-40 cases/1000/year. The identified gaps in vector distribution, particularly
      in malaria endemic areas, necessitate further surveys so as to generate the
      missing information.

TI  - Diversity of breeding habitats of anophelines (Diptera: Culicidae) in Ramgarh
      district, Jharkhand, India.
PG  - 327-334
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The Ramgarh district of Jharkhand state, India is highly
      malarious owing to abundance of different malaria vector species, namely
      Anopheles culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An. annularis. In spite of high
      prevalence of malaria vectors in Ramgarh, their larval ecology and climatic
      conditions affecting malaria dynamics have never been studied. Therefore, the
      objective of this study was to identify the diversity of potential breeding
      habitats and breeding preferences of anopheline vectors in the Ramgarh district. 
      METHODS: Anopheles immature collection was carried out at potential aquatic
      habitats in Ramgarh and Gola sites using the standard dipper on fortnightly basis
      from August 2012 to July 2013. The immatures were reared till adult emergence and
      further identified using standard keys. Temperature of outdoor and water bodies
      was recorded through temperature data loggers, and rainfall through standard rain
      gauges installed at each site. RESULTS: A total of 6495 immature specimens
      representing 17 Anopheles species including three malaria vectors, viz. An.
      culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An. annularis were collected from 11 types of
      breeding habitats. The highly preferred breeding habitats of vector anophelines
      were river bed pools, rivulets, wells, ponds, river margins, ditches and
      irrigation channels. Larval abundance of vector species showed site-specific
      variation with temperature and rainfall patterns throughout the year. The
      Shannon-Weiner diversity index ranged from 0.19 to 1.94 at Ramgarh site and 0.16 
      to 1.76 at Gola site. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study revealed that
      malaria vector species have been adapted to breed in a wide range of water
      bodies. The regular monitoring of such specific vector breeding sites under
      changing ecological and environmental conditions will be useful in guiding larval
      control operations selectively for effective vector/ malaria control.

TI  - Vorticella sp: Prospective Mosquito Biocontrol Agent.
PG  - 602-607
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the disadvantages of chemical insecticides, we aimed to
      evaluate Vorticella parasites for control of mosquito larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi and Aedes aegypti at different larval stages. METHODS: Vorticella sp
      infected mosquito larvae were crushed in the 0.85% saline and homogenized well to
      get Vorticella in suspension. The effects of Vorticella sp infections on larval
      development were investigated by inoculating protozoan on different larval
      instars of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti and observed under light microscope.
      Lethal time of the Vorticella infected larvae at different stages was calculated.
      RESULTS: First and 2nd larval instars of both An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti did
      not show signs of infection by Vorticella sp., whereas 3rd instars of An.
      stephensi showed more Vorticella infection than those of Ae. aegypti. However,
      4th larval instars of both mosquitoes were heavily infected with Vorticella
      parasite which was responsible for sluggish movements of larvae and eventually
      death. Moreover, parasites (Vorticella spp) were responsible for more than 90%
      reduction in adult emergence for both infected An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti.
      CONCLUSION: This study provides insights for mosquito larvicidal action of
      surface parasite Vorticella on different larval stages of An. stephensi and Ae.
      Aegypti. It could be suggested as a potential candidate in mosquito biocontrol
      programs.

      4-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl) piperazin-1-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)methanone derivatives
      (5-14) were synthesized, characterized and biologically evaluated for
      antiprotozoal activity. The compounds were screened in vitro against the HM1:
      IMSS strain of Entamoeba histolytica and NF54 chloroquine-sensitive strain of
      Plasmodium falciparum. Among the synthesized compounds six exhibited promising
      antiamoebic activity with IC50 values (0.14-1.26muM) lower than the standard drug
      metronidazole (IC50 1.80muM). All nine compounds exhibited antimalarial activity 
      (IC50 range: 1.42-19.62muM), while maintaining a favorable safety profile to host
      red blood cells. All the compounds were less effective as an antimalarial and
      more toxic (IC50 range: 14.67-81.24muM) than quinine (IC50: 275.6+/-16.46muM)
      against the human kidney epithelial cells. None of the compounds exhibited any
      inhibitory effect on the viability of Anopheles arabiensis mosquito larvae.

AB  - Complementing genome sequence with deep transcriptome and proteome data could
      enable more accurate assembly and annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Here, we
      provide a proof-of-concept of an integrated approach for analysis of the genome
      and proteome of Anopheles stephensi, which is one of the most important vectors
      of the malaria parasite. To achieve broad coverage of genes, we carried out
      transcriptome sequencing and deep proteome profiling of multiple anatomically
      distinct sites. Based on transcriptomic data alone, we identified and corrected
      535 events of incomplete genome assembly involving 1196 scaffolds and 868
      protein-coding gene models. This proteogenomic approach enabled us to add 365
      genes that were missed during genome annotation and identify 917 gene correction 
      events through discovery of 151 novel exons, 297 protein extensions, 231 exon
      extensions, 192 novel protein start sites, 19 novel translational frames, 28
      events of joining of exons, and 76 events of joining of adjacent genes as a
      single gene. Incorporation of proteomic evidence allowed us to change the
      designation of more than 87 predicted "noncoding RNAs" to conventional mRNAs
      coded by protein-coding genes. Importantly, extension of the newly corrected
      genome assemblies and gene models to 15 other newly assembled Anopheline genomes 
      led to the discovery of a large number of apparent discrepancies in assembly and 
      annotation of these genomes. Our data provide a framework for how future genome
      sequencing efforts should incorporate transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in
      combination with simultaneous manual curation to achieve near complete assembly
      and accurate annotation of genomes.

TI  - Towards green oviposition deterrents? Effectiveness of Syzygium lanceolatum
      (Myrtaceae) essential oil against six mosquito vectors and impact on four aquatic
      biological control agents.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) from plants may be alternative sources of molecules toxic
      against mosquito vectors of public health relevance. Most of researches in this
      field focused on EOs as larvicides or ovicides, while limited efforts focused on 
      the exploitation of EOs as oviposition deterrents. In the present study, the
      larvicidal and oviposition deterrent activity of Syzygium lanceolatum leaf EO was
      evaluated against six mosquito species, Anopheles stephensi, An. subpictus, Aedes
      aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The
      chemical composition of the S. lanceolatum EO was analyzed by GC-MS analysis,
      showing the presence of phenyl propanal, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, and 
      caryophyllene oxide as major constituents. S. lanceolatum EO showed high acute
      toxicity on An. stephensi (LC50 = 51.20 mug/ml), Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 55.11
      mug/ml), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 60.01 mug/ml), An. subpictus (LC50 = 61.34 
      mug/ml), Ae. albopictus (LC50 = 66.71 mug/ml), and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 = 
      72.24 mug/ml) larvae. Furthermore, the EO was effective as oviposition deterrent 
      against the six tested mosquito species, with OAI on An. stephensi, An.
      subpictus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus reaching -0.83, -0.81, -0.84, -0.83, -0.84, and -0.86,
      respectively. The toxicity of S. lanceolatum EO against several biological
      control agents of mosquitoes, including water bugs (Anisops bouvieri and
      Diplonychus indicus) and fishes (Gambusia affinis and Poecilia reticulata), was
      extremely low, with LC50 ranging between 4148 and 15,762 mug/ml. Overall, our
      results pointed out the promising potential of the S. lanceolatum leaf EO as a
      source of environmental-friendly oviposition deterrents and larvicides effective 
      against a wide number of mosquito species of importance for parasitology.

TI  - Three-dimensional modelling of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel from
      Anopheles gambiae reveals spatial clustering of evolutionarily conserved acidic
      residues at the extracellular sites.
AB  - The eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel(e-Nav) is a large asymmetric
      transmembrane protein with important functions concerning neurological function. 
      No structure has been resolved at high resolution for this protein. A homology
      model of the transmembrane and extracellular regions of an Anopheles gambiae
      para-like channel with emphasis on the pore entrance has been constructed, based 
      upon the templates provided by a prokaryotic sodium channel and a potassium
      two-pore channel. The latter provides a template for the extracellular regions,
      which are located above the entrance to the pore, which is likely to open at a
      side of a dome formed by these loops. A model created with this arrangement shows
      a structure similar to low-resolution cryo-electron microscope images of a
      related structure. The pore entrance also shows favorable electrostatic
      interface. Residues responsible for the negative charge around the pore have been
      traced in phylogeny to highlight their importance. This model is intended for the
      study of pore-blocking toxins.

AB  - Mosquitoes act as vectors of key pathogens and parasites. Plant essential oils
      have been recognized as important sources of biopesticides, which do not induce
      resistance and have limited toxic effects on human health and non-target
      organisms. In this research, we evaluated the larvicidal and oviposition
      deterrence activity of Hedychium larsenii essential oil (EO) and its major
      compounds ar-curcumene and epi-beta-bisabolol. Both molecules showed high
      toxicity against early third instars of Anopheles stephensi (LC50=10.45 and
      14.68microg/ml), Aedes aegypti (LC50=11.24 and 15.83microg/ml) and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (LC50=12.24 and 17.27microg/ml). In addition, low doses of
      ar-curcumene and epi-beta-bisabolol were effective as oviposition deterrents
      against the three tested mosquito species. Notably, the acute toxicity of H.
      larsenii oil and its major compounds against the mosquito biocontrol agent
      Poecilia reticulata was low, with LC50 higher than 1500ppm. Overall, the results 
      from this study revealed that ar-curcumene and epi-beta-bisabolol from the H.
      larsenii oil can be considered for the development of novel and effective
      mosquito larvicides.

AB  - Plumbagin was isolated and characterized from the roots of Plumbago zeylanica
      using chromatography: TLC, Column chromatogram, HPLC, FTIR and 1H NMR. The
      isolated pure compounds were assayed for potency as inhibitors of: acetylcholine 
      esterase (AchE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
      cytochrome P450 and alpha, beta-esterase, and for repellency with Anopheles
      stephensi at four different concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100ppm). The enzyme
      assay against the pure compound reveals that the level of esterase and SOD was
      decreased significantly in contrast the level of GST and cytochrome P450 was
      increased significantly. Our results suggests that novel Plumbagin has
      significantly alters the level of enzyme comparable to the control. Evaluations
      resulted in Plumbagin producing maximum repellency scores against An. stephensi
      mosquitoes in dose dependent manner with highest repellence was observed in the
      100ppm. Histological examination showed that the midgut, hindgut and muscles are 
      the most affected tissues. These tissues affected with major changes including
      separation and collapse of epithelial layer and cellular vacuolization. The
      results support the utility of plant compound Plumbagin for vector control as an 
      alternative to synthetic insecticides, however, more vigorous field trials are
      needed to determine viability under natural conditions.

AB  - Present study was carried out to establish the influence of abiotic factors on
      foraging activities of a predatory hemipteran insect Anisops sardea against
      Anopheles stephensi larvae. The functional response of A. sardea was evaluated in
      variable density of prey items with variation in search area (100, 250, 500 and
      1000ml water volume) and temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results of
      laboratory bioassay revealed that prey consumption rate of predator species was
      positively related with increasing temperature and inversely related with
      increasing search area. Polynomial logistic regression equations and associated
      parameters showed that A. sardea exhibited a type II functional response in
      variable search area and type-III response at variable temperatures. Related
      response specific attack rates and handling times were also evaluated in presence
      of specific abiotic factors.

TI  - Population Density, Climate Variables and Poverty Synergistically Structure
      Spatial Risk in Urban Malaria in India.
PG  - e0005155
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The world is rapidly becoming urban with the global population living
      in cities projected to double by 2050. This increase in urbanization poses new
      challenges for the spread and control of communicable diseases such as malaria.
      In particular, urban environments create highly heterogeneous socio-economic and 
      environmental conditions that can affect the transmission of vector-borne
      diseases dependent on human water storage and waste water management.
      Interestingly India, as opposed to Africa, harbors a mosquito vector, Anopheles
      stephensi, which thrives in the man-made environments of cities and acts as the
      vector for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, making the malaria
      problem a truly urban phenomenon. Here we address the role and determinants of
      within-city spatial heterogeneity in the incidence patterns of vivax malaria, and
      then draw comparisons with results for falciparum malaria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Statistical analyses and a phenomenological transmission model are
      applied to an extensive spatio-temporal dataset on cases of Plasmodium vivax in
      the city of Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India) that spans 12 years monthly at the level
      of wards. A spatial pattern in malaria incidence is described that is largely
      stationary in time for this parasite. Malaria risk is then shown to be associated
      with socioeconomic indicators and environmental parameters, temperature and
      humidity. In a more dynamical perspective, an Inhomogeneous Markov Chain Model is
      used to predict vivax malaria risk. Models that account for climate factors,
      socioeconomic level and population size show the highest predictive skill. A
      comparison to the transmission dynamics of falciparum malaria reinforces the
      conclusion that the spatio-temporal patterns of risk are strongly driven by
      extrinsic factors. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Climate forcing and socio-economic
      heterogeneity act synergistically at local scales on the population dynamics of
      urban malaria in this city. The stationarity of malaria risk patterns provides a 
      basis for more targeted intervention, such as vector control, based on
      transmission 'hotspots'. This is especially relevant for P. vivax, a more
      resilient parasite than P. falciparum, due to its ability to relapse and the
      operational shortcomings of delivering a "radical cure".

AB  - We used the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate-H climate model with 
      the A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 and
      CLIMEX software for projections to illustrate the potential impact of climate
      change on the spatial distributions of malaria in China, India, Indochina,
      Indonesia, and The Philippines based on climate variables such as temperature,
      moisture, heat, cold and dryness. The model was calibrated using data from
      several knowledge domains, including geographical distribution records. The areas
      in which malaria has currently been detected are consistent with those showing
      high values of the ecoclimatic index in the CLIMEX model. The match between
      prediction and reality was found to be high. More than 90% of the observed
      malaria distribution points were associated with the currently known suitable
      climate conditions. Climate suitability for malaria is projected to decrease in
      India, southern Myanmar, southern Thailand, eastern Borneo, and the region
      bordering Cambodia, Malaysia and the Indonesian islands, while it is expected to 
      increase in southern and south-eastern China and Taiwan. The climatic models for 
      Anopheles mosquitoes presented here should be useful for malaria control,
      monitoring, and management, particularly considering these future climate
      scenarios.

TI  - Characterization and control of symbiotic Bacillus cereus isolated from the mid
      gut of Anopheles subpictus Grassi.
PG  - 1414-1421
AB  - An investigation was done to find out the role of gut bacterium on the larval
      development and survival of Anopheles subpictus, the vector responsible for the
      transmission of malaria. An. subpictus mosquitoes breed exclusively in stagnant
      water, including shrimp/fish ponds with high nutrient level. One bacterial strain
      (CX2) was isolated from the midgut of late third instar of mosquito larvae. The
      bacterial isolate was sensitive to recommended doses of tetracyclin (30
      microg/disc), doxycycline (30 microg/disc), kanamycin (30 microg/disc),
      gentamycin (10 microg/disc), streptomycin (10 microg/disc), vancomycin (30
      microg/disc), ofloxacin (5 microg/disc), levofloxacin (5 microg/disc),
      gatifloxacin (10 microg/disc), but resistant to ampicillin (10 microg/disc).The
      larvae which were fed with the mixture of two antibiotics tetracylin (30
      microg/disc) and doxycyclin (30 microg/disc) (1:1) could not survive in
      rice-field water. In the control experiments without any antibiotic treatment,
      95-100 % survival and 95 % adult emergence were observed. The study indicates
      that the elimination of gut bacteria suppressed larval growth. Phylogenetic
      analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence was also done. Based on the morphological,
      biochemical, FAME analysis and phylogenetic analysis, the bacterial isolate CX2
      was identified as Bacillus cereus. Poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis
      revealed that the isolate showed discrete bands ranging from 24.272 to 60.049 kDa
      proteins. Water extract and methanol extract of Tamarindus indica showed
      inhibitory effect against B. cereus.

AB  - Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, categorized as nematodes,
      are responsible for causing lymphatic filariasis. Even though it can affect
      individuals of all age groups and both genders, it predominantly affects people
      of low socioeconomic strata. The filarial worms dwell in the subcutaneous tissues
      and lymphatics of human hosts. In India, W bancrofti is the primary nematode to
      cause filariasis, which is transmitted through the bite of blood-sucking infected
      female anopheles mosquitoes. Lymphangitis, leading to elephantiasis of the legs, 
      arms, scrotum, and breast, is the most salient clinical feature of lymphatic
      filariasis. The presence of filarial worms in the oral and perioral soft tissues 
      is uncommon; moreover, the presence of filarial worms in a centrally occurring
      bony lesion is highly unusual and has not yet been reported. We report a case of 
      a central giant cell granuloma due to filariasis that was diagnosed after biopsy 
      of innocuous radiolucent bony lesions of the maxilla and mandible.

AB  - Anopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV) is a potential microbial agent for
      paratransgenesis and gene transduction in An. gambiae, the major vector of human 
      malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the interaction between AgDNV and
      An. gambiae is critical for using AgDNV in a basic and applied manner for
      Anopheles gene manipulation. Here, we tested the effects of mosquito age, sex,
      blood feeding status, and potential for horizontal transmission using an enhanced
      green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter AgDNV system. Neither mosquito age at
      infection nor feeding regime affected viral titers. Female mosquitoes were more
      permissive to viral infection than males. Despite low viral titers, infected
      males were able to venereally transmit virus to females during mating, where the 
      virus was localized with the transferred sperm in the spermathecae. These
      findings will be useful for designing AgDNV-based strategies to manipulate
      Anopheles gambiae.

AB  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) vectors are solely responsible for transmitting
      important diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis,
      lymphatic filariasis and Zika virus. Eco-friendly control tools of Culicidae
      vectors are a priority. In this study, we proposed a facile fabrication process
      of poly-disperse and stable silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using a cheap leaf
      extract of Ichnocarpus frutescens (Apocyanaceae). Bio-reduced Ag NPs were
      characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), atomic force microscopy
      (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM). The acute toxicity of I. frutescens leaf extract and green-synthesized Ag 
      NPs was evaluated against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the
      dengue vector Aedes albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract, Ag NPs showed higher
      toxicity against A. subpictus, A. albopictus, and C. tritaeniorhynchus with LC50 
      values of 14.22, 15.84 and 17.26mug/mL, respectively. Ag NPs were found safer to 
      non-target mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia 
      affinis, with LC50 values ranging from 636.61 to 2098.61mug/mL. Overall, this
      research firstly shed light on the mosquitocidal potential of I. frutescens, a
      potential bio-resource for rapid, cheap and effective synthesis of poly-disperse 
      and highly stable silver nanocrystals.

TI  - Biology, distribution and control of Anopheles (Cellia) minimus in the context of
      malaria transmission in northeastern India.
PG  - 585
AB  - Among six dominant mosquito vector species involved in malaria transmission in
      India, Anopheles minimus is a major species in northeast India and held
      responsible for focal disease outbreaks characterized by high-rise of Plasmodium 
      falciparum infections and attributable death cases. It has been now genetically
      characterized that among the three-member species of the Minimus Complex spread
      in Asia, An. minimus (former species A) is prevalent in India including
      northeastern states and east-central state of Odisha. It is recorded in all
      seasons and accounts for perennial transmission evidenced by records of
      sporozoite infections. This species is highly anthropophilic, and largely
      endophilic and endophagic, recorded breeding throughout the year in slow flowing 
      seepage water streams. The populations of An. minimus in India are reported to be
      highly diverse indicating population expansion with obvious implications for
      judicious application of vector control interventions. Given the rapid ecological
      changes due to deforestation, population migration and expansion and
      developmental activities, there is scope for further research on the existence of
      potential additional sibling species within the An. minimus complex and bionomics
      studies on a large geographical scale for species sanitation. For control of
      vector populations, DDT continues to be applied on account of retaining
      susceptibility status even after decades of residual spraying. Anopheles minimus 
      is a highly adaptive species and requires continuous and sustained efforts for
      its effective control to check transmission and spread of drug-resistant malaria.
      Anopheles minimus populations are reportedly diminishing in northeastern India
      whereas it has staged comeback in east-central State of Odisha after decades of
      disappearance with its eco-biological characteristics intact. It is the high time
      to siege the opportunity for strengthening interventions against this species for
      its population diminution to sub-optimal levels for reducing transmission in
      achieving malaria elimination by target date of 2030.

TI  - Intricacies of using temperature of different niches for assessing impact on
      malaria transmission.
PG  - 67-75
LID - 10.4103/0971-5916.193285 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The influence of temperature on the life cycle of
      mosquitoes as well as on development of malaria parasite in mosquitoes is well
      studied. Most of the studies use outdoor temperature for understanding the
      transmission dynamics and providing projections of malaria. As the mosquitoes
      breed in water and rest usually indoors, it is logical to relate the transmission
      dynamics with temperature of micro-niche. The present study was, therefore,
      undertaken to understand the influence of different formats of temperature of
      different micro-niches on transmission of malaria for providing more realistic
      projections. METHODS: The study was conducted in one village each of Assam and
      Uttarakhand s0 tates of India. Temperatures recorded from outdoor (air) as well
      as indoor habitats (resting place of mosquito) were averaged into daily,
      fortnightly and monthly and were used for determination of transmission windows
      (TWs) for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and P. falciparum (Pf) based on minimum
      temperature threshold required for transmission. RESULTS: The daily temperature
      was found more useful for calculation of sporogony than fortnightly and monthly
      temperatures. Monthly TWs were further refined using fortnightly temperature,
      keeping in view the completion of more than one life cycle of malaria vectors and
      sporogony of malaria parasite in a month. A linear regression equation was
      generated to find out the relationship between outdoor and indoor temperatures
      and R [2] to predict the percentage of variation in indoor temperature as a
      function of outdoor temperature at both localities. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS:
      The study revealed that the indoor temperature was more than outdoors in stable
      malarious area (Assam) but fluctuating in low endemic area like Uttarakhand.
      Transmission windows of malaria should be determined by transforming outdoor data
      to indoor and preferably at fortnightly interval. With daily recorded
      temperature, sporogonic and gonotrophic cycles can also be calculated which is
      otherwise not possible with monthly data. The study highlights that the
      projections made for malaria in view of climate change need to be seen with
      limitation of difference in outdoor and indoor temperatures at different
      locations, highlighting the need for local data generation at least at
      sub-district level.

AB  - Mosquitoes are major vectors for the transmission of many diseases like
      chikungunya, malaria, dengue, zika, etc. worldwide. In the present study,
      selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were synthesized from Clausena dentata and were
      tested for their larvicidal efficacy against the fourth-instar larvae of
      Anopheles stephensi, Aedes Aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The synthesized
      nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform
      Infrared Radiation (FTIR) spectroscopy, EDaX, and SEM. The results recorded from 
      UV-Vis spectroscopy show the peak absorption spectrum at 420 nm. In FTIR, the
      maximum peak value is 2922.25 cm-1 assigned to N-H group (amide group). In EDaX
      analysis shows peak around 72.64 which confirm the binding intensity of selenium.
      In SEM analysis, the synthesized SeNPs sizes were ranging from 46.32 nm to 78.88 
      nm. The synthesized SeNPs produced high mortality with very low concentration
      (LC50) were 240.714 mg/L; 104.13 mg/L, and 99.602 mg/L for A. stephensi, A.
      Aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. These results suggest that the C.
      dentata leaf extract-mediated biosynthesis of SeNPs has the potential to be used 
      as an ideal ecofriendly approach toward the control of mosquito vectors at early 
      stages.

TI  - Does fluoride influence oviposition of Anopheles stephensi in stored water
      habitats in an urban setting?
PG  - 549
AB  - BACKGROUND: The physico-chemical characteristics of lentic aquatic habitats
      greatly influence mosquito species in selecting suitable oviposition sites;
      immature development, pupation and adult emergence, therefore are considerations 
      for their preferred ecological niche. Correlating water quality parameters with
      mosquito breeding, as well as immature vector density, are useful for vector
      control operations in identifying and targeting potential breeding habitats.
      METHODS: A total of 40 known habitats of Anopheles stephensi, randomly selected
      based on a vector survey in parallel, were inspected for the physical and
      chemical nature of the aquatic environment. Water samples were collected four
      times during 2013, representing four seasons (i.e., ten habitats per season). The
      physico-chemical variables and mosquito breeding were statistically analysed to
      find their correlation with immature density of An. stephensi and also
      co-inhabitation with other mosquito species. RESULTS: Anopheles stephensi prefer 
      water with low nitrite content and high phosphate content. Parameters such as
      total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, chloride,
      fluoride and sulfate had a positive correlation in habitats with any mosquito
      species breeding (p < 0.05) and also in habitats with An. stephensi alone
      breeding. Fluoride was observed to have a strong positive correlation with
      immature density of An. stephensi in both overhead tanks and wells. CONCLUSION:
      Knowledge of larval ecology of vector mosquitoes is a key factor in risk
      assessment and for implementing appropriate and sustainable vector control
      operations. The presence of fluoride in potential breeding habitats and a strong 
      positive correlation with An. stephensi immature density is useful information,
      as fluoride can be considered an indicator/predictor of vector breeding.
      Effective larval source management can be focussed on specified habitats in
      vulnerable areas to reduce vector abundance and malaria transmission.

TI  - The changing malaria landscape in Aseer region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia:
      2000-2015.
PG  - 538
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2004, a revised action plan was developed, supported by the World 
      Health Organization, to eliminate malaria from Saudi Arabia by preventing
      re-introduction of malaria into regions since declared malaria free, eliminating 
      foci of transmission in the Mecca and Medina areas and a concerted effort of foci
      surveillance and control, to eliminate malaria from the regions of Jazan and
      Aseer. This paper provides the context, activities, progress, and possible
      contributions toward malaria elimination in the Aseer region since 2000, with a
      more detailed analysis of the spatial location of locally acquired case incidence
      since 2012. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of all available Ministry of
      Health surveillance data and process reports since 2000, with higher spatial
      resolution analysis of data between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS: In 2000, there were
      511 cases of Plasmodium falciparum locally acquired infection. The following 4
      years witnessed a dramatic decline in cases to only 18 locally acquired
      infections reported in 2005. A resurgence in local infections was reported in
      2006 (93) and 2007 (165), thereafter (2008-2014) local cases continued to decline
      to fewer than 40 per year across the region. However, in 2015, a small rise was
      noted (51). All locally acquired infections were P. falciparum. There has been a 
      constant flow of imported infections into Aseer since 2000, mostly among
      immigrant labour from Pakistan, India, Sudan, and Yemen. Imported infections have
      included both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. The spatial extent of malaria
      appears to be changing, but there remain two intractable areas Sarat Abeda and
      Dhran Aljanub, where risks per reporting centre have changed little since 2001,
      remaining above 0.5 per 10,000 population. Only seven villages contributed 55% of
      all locally acquired infection since 2012. DISCUSSION: Aseer has reached a state 
      of very low incidence of locally acquired infections, despite a constant source
      of imported infections from outside the country. How many of the local infections
      are F2 generations from imported infections or how many are a result of residual 
      active transmission between asymptomatic carriers of infections transmitted by
      pockets of existing Anopheles arabiensis populations remains unknown. A more
      detailed investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of infected hosts,
      parasites and vectors would help define whether this region has managed to
      effectively prevent local transmission of new infections.

AB  - A main challenge in parasitology is the development of reliable tools to prevent 
      or treat mosquito-borne diseases. We investigated the toxicity of magnetic
      nanoparticles (MNP) produced by Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (strain MSR-1)
      on chloroquine-resistant (CQ-r) and sensitive (CQ-s) Plasmodium falciparum,
      dengue virus (DEN-2), and two of their main vectors, Anopheles stephensi and
      Aedes aegypti, respectively. MNP were studied by Fourier-transform infrared
      spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. They were toxic to larvae and 
      pupae of An. stephensi, LC50 ranged from 2.563 ppm (1st instar larva) to 6.430
      ppm (pupa), and Ae. aegypti, LC50 ranged from 3.231 ppm (1st instar larva) to
      7.545 ppm (pupa). MNP IC50 on P. falciparum were 83.32 mug ml-1 (CQ-s) and 87.47 
      mug ml-1 (CQ-r). However, the in vivo efficacy of MNP on Plasmodium berghei was
      low if compared to CQ-based treatments. Moderate cytotoxicity was detected on
      Vero cells post-treatment with MNP doses lower than 4 mug ml-1. MNP evaluated at 
      2-8 mug ml-1 inhibited DEN-2 replication inhibiting the expression of the
      envelope (E) protein. In conclusion, our findings represent the first report
      about the use of MNP in medical and veterinary entomology, proposing them as
      suitable materials to develop reliable tools to combat mosquito-borne diseases.

AB  - Greener synthesis of a series of novel indolizine analogues have been achieved by
      the cyclization of aromatic cycloimmonium ylides with electron-deficient alkynes 
      in the presence of water as the base and solvent at 80 degrees C. Yield of the
      title compounds was good and reactions performed were eco-friendly. The
      structures of these newly synthesized compounds have been confirmed by
      spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, NMR, LC-MS, and elemental analysis.
      Characterized title compounds were evaluated for larvicidal activity against
      Anopheles arabiensis by standard WHO larvicidal assay using Temefos as standard
      at 4 mug/mL. Title compounds 2e, 2f, and 2g emerged as promising larvicidal
      agents.

TI  - Immune Escape Strategies of Malaria Parasites.
PG  - 1617
AB  - Malaria is one of the most life-threatening infectious diseases worldwide.
      Immunity to malaria is slow and short-lived despite the repeated parasite
      exposure in endemic areas. Malaria parasites have evolved refined machinery to
      evade the immune system based on a range of genetic changes that include allelic 
      variation, biomolecular exposure of proteins, and intracellular replication. All 
      of these features increase the probability of survival in both mosquitoes and the
      vertebrate host. Plasmodium species escape from the first immunological trap in
      its invertebrate vector host, the Anopheles mosquitoes. The parasites have to
      pass through various immunological barriers within the mosquito such as
      anti-microbial molecules and the mosquito microbiota in order to achieve
      successful transmission to the vertebrate host. Within these hosts, Plasmodium
      species employ various immune evasion strategies during different life cycle
      stages. Parasite persistence against the vertebrate immune response depends on
      the balance among virulence factors, pathology, metabolic cost of the host immune
      response, and the parasites ability to evade the immune response. In this review 
      we discuss the strategies that Plasmodium parasites use to avoid the vertebrate
      host immune system and how they promote successful infection and transmission.

TI  - Epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax Malaria in India.
PG  - 108-120
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0163 [doi]
AB  - Historically, malaria in India was predominantly caused by Plasmodium vivax,
      accounting for 53% of the estimated cases. After the spread of drug-resistant
      Plasmodium falciparum in the 1990s, the prevalence of the two species remained
      equivalent at the national level for a decade. By 2014, the proportion of P.
      vivax has decreased to 34% nationally, but with high regional variation. In 2014,
      P. vivax accounted for around 380,000 malaria cases in India; almost a sixth of
      all P. vivax cases reported globally. Plasmodium vivax has remained resistant to 
      control measures, particularly in urban areas. Urban malaria is predominantly
      caused by P. vivax and is subject to outbreaks, often associated with increased
      mortality, and triggered by bursts of migration and construction. The
      epidemiology of P. vivax varies substantially within India, including multiple
      relapse phenotypes with varying latencies between primary infection and relapse. 
      Moreover, the hypnozoite reservoir maintains transmission potential and enables
      reestablishment of the parasite in areas in which it was thought eradicated. The 
      burden of malaria in India is complex because of the highly variable malaria
      eco-epidemiological profiles, transmission factors, and the presence of multiple 
      Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors. This review of P. vivax malaria in
      India describes epidemiological trends with particular attention to four states: 
      Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, and Odisha.

TI  - Neem (Azadirachta indica): towards the ideal insecticide?
PG  - 369-386

AB  - Pesticide resistance is going to change rapidly our antibiotics and insecticides 
      arsenal. In this scenario, plant-derived natural products are considered valuable
      candidates to reverse this negative trend. Growing research attention is focused 
      on neem (Azadirachta indica, Meliaceae), exploring the utility of its products as
      insecticides and antibiotics. In this review, we summarised the knowledge on neem
      oil and neem cake by-products in arthropod pest control, with special reference
      to mosquito vectors of public health importance. To the best of our knowledge,
      neem-borne products currently showed effective and eco-friendly features,
      including little non-target effects, multiple mechanisms of action, low cost,
      easy production in countries with limited industrial facilities. In particular,
      the potentiality of neem cake as ideal and affordable source of mosquitocidal
      compounds in anopheline and aedine control programmes is outlined. Overall, we
      propose the employ of neem-based products as an advantageous alternative to build
      newer and safer arthropod control tools.

TI  - Role of An. culicifacies as a vector of malaria in changing ecological scenario
      of Northeastern states of India.
PG  - 264-71
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria has become endemic and subject of concern in
      most part of the India especially Northeastern states of India. Surveys before
      2000 revealed that Anopheles minimus was major vector responsible for
      transmission of malaria in this region followed by An. dirus and An. fluviatilis.
      However, recent studies indicate replacement of An. minimus vector by An.
      culicifacies due to different ecological changes and change in landuse pattern
      etc. The objective of present study was to explore the vectorial role of An.
      culicifacies in transmission of malaria in four malaria endemic states, viz.
      Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Sikkim of India. METHODS: The seven surveys were
      conducted in 176 selected villages belonging to eight districts of the four
      states in both pre-monsoon (March-April) and post-monsoon (September-October)
      seasons from 2010 to 2013. However, in 2011 surveys could not be carried out due 
      to public inconvenience in pre-monsoon season. For vectorial role of all vector
      species collected, ELISA and PCR were assayed. RESULTS: A total of 19,173
      specimens belonging to 30 anopheline species were collected, out of which 4315
      belonged to four established vector species. In total, 4183 specimens were
      processed through ELISA, out of which 236 specimens were found positive for
      circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Further, infectivity was confirmed by PCR in 35
      samples, of which 12 samples were found positive for Plasmodium falciparum and
      three for P. vivax. Out of 12 Plasmodium falciparum positive samples, nine
      samples were positive for An. culicifacies, two for An. fluviatilis and one for
      An. minimus. While out of three Plasmodium vivax positive samples, two samples
      were positive for An. dirus and one sample was positive for An. culicifacies.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Anopheles culicifacies replaced the An. minimus, the
      vector of malaria in Northeastern states of India, as it was found to be highly
      infected with malaria parasite as compared to An. minimus by ELISA and PCR
      analysis, and thus playing a major role in malaria transmission in this region.
      The ecological changes like deforestation, development of irrigation channels and
      change in landuse pattern, have helped in evolution of An. culicifacies in the
      study area. Therefore, modified vector control strategies are required on urgent 
      basis.

AB  - Anopheles mosquito transmits Plasmodium, the malaria causing parasite. Different 
      species of Anopheles mosquito dominate in a particular geographical location and 
      are capable of transmitting specific strains of Plasmodium. It is important to
      understand the biology of different anophelines to control the parasite
      transmission. STAT is an evolutionary conserved transcription factor that
      regulates the parasite development in African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae.
      Unlike Drosophila and Aedes aegypti, where a single STAT gene plays an important 
      role in immunity, An. gambiae contains one evolutionary conserved STAT-A and
      another retro-duplicated, introns-less STAT-B gene. To find out whether other
      species of Anopheles also have two STATs, the available genomic data of different
      anophelines were used to annotate their STATs through in silico analyses. Our
      results revealed that Indian malaria vector An. stephensi genome contains two
      STATs, AsSTAT-A and AsSTAT-B genes. These genes were cloned and confirmed by
      sequencing. Both AsSTATs were found to be expressed in different development
      stages of mosquito. However, the relative mRNA levels of evolutionary conserved
      AsSTAT-A gene were always higher than the retroduplicated AsSTAT-B gene. STAT
      pathway was activated upon Plasmodium berghei infection, indicated its role in
      immunity. Furthermore, comparative in silico analysis of eighteen Anopheles
      species revealed that five species: An. sinensis, An. albimanus, An. darlingi,
      An. dirus andAn. farauti do not contain STAT-B gene in their genome.
      Interestingly, thirteen species of the subgenus Anopheles and Cellia that contain
      both STATs were also mutually diverged. This consequence leads to sequence
      variability in some significant protein motifs within the STAT-B genes.
      Phylogenetic analyses indicated that an independent, lineage-specific duplication
      occurred in the subgenus Cellia after the diversification of series Neomyzomyia
      from its last common ancestor. In An. atroparvus (subgenus Anopheles), STAT gene 
      underwent recent lineage-specific duplication and give rise to a highly similar
      STAT-B gene. This suggested that the genetic divergence in various Anopheles
      species might appeared due to their adaptations to the altered environmental
      conditions or pathogen encounters.

TI  - Silencing of Anopheles stephensi Heme Peroxidase HPX15 Activates Diverse Immune
      Pathways to Regulate the Growth of Midgut Bacteria.
PG  - 1351
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01351 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles mosquito midgut harbors a diverse group of endogenous bacteria that
      grow extensively after the blood feeding and help in food digestion and nutrition
      in many ways. Although, the growth of endogenous bacteria is regulated by various
      factors, however, the robust antibacterial immune reactions are generally
      suppressed in this body compartment by a heme peroxidase HPX15 crosslinked mucins
      barrier. This barrier is formed on the luminal side of the midgut and blocks the 
      direct interactions and recognition of bacteria or their elicitors by the immune 
      reactive midgut epithelium. We hypothesized that in the absence of HPX15, an
      increased load of exogenous bacteria will enormously induce the mosquito midgut
      immunity and this situation in turn, can easily regulate mosquito-pathogen
      interactions. In this study, we found that the blood feeding induced AsHPX15 gene
      in Anopheles stephensi midgut and promoted the growth of endogenous as well as
      exogenous fed bacteria. In addition, the mosquito midgut also efficiently
      regulated the number of these bacteria through the induction of classical Toll
      and Imd immune pathways. In case of AsHPX15 silenced midguts, the growth of
      midgut bacteria was largely reduced through the induction of nitric oxide
      synthase (NOS) gene, a downstream effector molecule of the JAK/STAT pathway.
      Interestingly, no significant induction of the classical immune pathways was
      observed in these midguts. Importantly, the NOS is a well known negative
      regulator of Plasmodium development, thus, we proposed that the induction of
      diverged immune pathways in the absence of HPX15 mediated midgut barrier might be
      one of the strategies to manipulate the vectorial capacity of Anopheles mosquito.

TI  - Artemisia absinthium-borne compounds as novel larvicides: effectiveness against
      six mosquito vectors and acute toxicity on non-target aquatic organisms.
PG  - 4649-4661
AB  - The eco-friendly control of mosquito vectors is a crucial challenge of public
      health importance. Here we evaluated the larvicidal potential of Artemisia
      absinthium essential oil (EO) and its three major chemical constituents against
      six mosquito vectors: Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles subpictus, Aedes aegypti,
      Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The EO was
      obtained by leaf hydro-distillation. Its chemical composition was analyzed using 
      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Major components were (E)-beta-farnesene
      (31.6 %), (Z)-en-yn-dicycloether (11.12 %), and (Z)-beta-ocimene (27.8 %). The EO
      was toxic effect against larval populations of An. stephensi, An. subpictus, Ae. 
      aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, with
      LC50 values of 41.85, 52.02, 46.33, 57.57, 50.57, and 62.16 mug/ml.
      (E)-beta-farnesene, (Z)-en-yn-dicycloether, and (Z)-beta-ocimene were highly
      effective on An. stephensi (LC50 = 8.13, 16.24 and 25.84 mug/ml) followed by An. 
      subpictus (LC50 = 10.18, 20.99, and 30.86 mug/ml), Ae. aegypti (LC50 =
      8.83,17.66, and 28.35 mug/ml), Ae. albopictus (LC50 = 11.38,23.47, and 33.72
      mug/ml), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 9.66, 19.76, and 31.52 mug/ml), and Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 = 12.51,25.88, and 37.13 mug/ml). Notably, the EO and its
      major compounds were safer to the non-target organisms Chironomous circumdatus,
      Anisops bouvieri and Gambusia affinis, with LC50 values ranging from 207.22 to
      4385 mug/ml. Overall, our results highlight that (E)-beta-farnesene,
      (Z)-en-yn-dicycloether, and (Z)-beta-ocimene from the A. absinthium EO represent 
      promising eco-friendly larvicides against six key mosquito vectors with moderate 
      toxicity against non-target organisms.

AB  - Mosquito control is facing key challenges, including outbreaks of new arbovirus
      threats. We proposed an eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
      employing a low-cost extract of Hugonia mystax. AgNPs were specified by UV, XRD, 
      FTIR and EDX spectroscopy, SEM and TEM. AgNPs were more toxic to Anopheles
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae (LC50: 14.45, 15.86, 
      and 17.46 mug/mL) if compared to aquatic biocontrol organisms Gambusia affinis,
      Diplonychus indicus, and Anisops bouvieri (LC50: 2567.15, 1075.16, and 829.63
      mug/ml). Overall, we shed light on the mosquito larvicidal efficacy of H. mystax,
      a possible biological resource for low-cost fabrication of AgNPs.

AB  - To identify the larvicidal activities of silver nanoparticles synthesised with
      Avicennia marina leaf extract against the larvae of Aedes aegypti and Anopheleus 
      stephensi, in vitro larvicidal activities such as LC50 and LC90 were assessed.
      Further, characterisation such as UV and FTIR analysis were carried out for the
      synthesised silver nanoparticles. The LC50 value of the synthesised silver
      nanoparticles was identified as 4.374 and 7.406 mg/L for An. stephensi and Ae.
      aegypti larvae respectively. Further, the LC90 values are also identified as
      4.928 and 9.865 mg/L for An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti species respectively. The 
      synthesised silver nanoparticles have maximum absorption at 420 nm with the
      average size of 60-95 nm. The FTIR data showed prominent peaks in (3940.57,
      3929.00, 3803.63, 3712.97, 2918.30, 2231.64, 1610.50, 1377.17, 1257.59, 1041.59, 
      1041.56, 775.38, 667.37 and 503.21) different ranges. The biosynthesis of silver 
      nanoparticles with leaf aqueous extract of A. marina provides potential source
      for the larvicidal activity against mosquito borne diseases. The present study
      proved the mosquitocidal properties of silver nanoparticles synthesised from
      mangroves of Vellar estuary. This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the
      vector control programs.

TI  - Acute toxicity and repellent activity of the Origanum scabrum Boiss. & Heldr.
      (Lamiaceae) essential oil against four mosquito vectors of public health
      importance and its biosafety on non-target aquatic organisms.
PG  - 23228-23238
AB  - The recent outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus highlighted the
      pivotal importance of mosquito vector control in tropical and subtropical areas
      worldwide. However, mosquito control is facing hot challenges, mainly due to the 
      rapid development of pesticide resistance in Culicidae and the limited success of
      biocontrol programs on Aedes mosquitoes. In this framework, screening botanicals 
      for their mosquitocidal potential may offer effective and eco-friendly tools in
      the fight against mosquitoes. In the present study, the essential oil (EO)
      obtained from the medicinal plant Origanum scabrum was analyzed by GC-MS and
      evaluated for its mosquitocidal and repellent activities towards Anopheles
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus.
      GC-MS analysis showed a total of 28 compounds, representing 97.1 % of the EO. The
      major constituents were carvacrol (48.2 %) and thymol (16.6 %). The EO was toxic 
      effect to the A. stephensi, A. aegypti, C. quinquefasciatus, and C.
      tritaeniorhynchus larvae, with LC50 of 61.65, 67.13, 72.45, and 78.87 mug/ml,
      respectively. Complete ovicidal activity was observed at 160, 200, 240, and 280
      mug/ml, respectively. Against adult mosquitoes, LD50 were 122.38, 134.39, 144.53,
      and 158.87 mug/ml, respectively. In repellency assays, the EOs tested at 1.0,
      2.5, and 5.0 mg/cm2 concentration of O. scabrum gave 100 % protection from
      mosquito bites up to 210, 180, 150, and 120 min, respectively. From an
      eco-toxicological point of view, the EO was tested on three non-target mosquito
      predators, Gambusia affinis, Diplonychus indicus, and Anisops bouvieri, with LC50
      ranging from 4162 to 12,425 mug/ml. Overall, the EO from O. scabrum may be
      considered as a low-cost and eco-friendly source of phytochemicals to develop
      novel repellents against Culicidae.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161870 [doi]
AB  - In order to understand the importance of functional proteins in mosquito
      behavior, following blood meal, a baseline proteomic dataset is essential for
      providing insights into the physiology of blood feeding. Therefore, in this study
      as first step, in solution and 1-D electrophoresis digestion approach combined
      with tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS) and computational bioinformatics
      for data mining was used to prepare a baseline proteomic catalogue of salivary
      gland proteins of sugar fed An. culicifacies mosquitoes. A total of 106 proteins 
      were identified and analyzed by SEQUEST algorithm against mosquito protein
      database from Uniprot/NCBI. Importantly, D7r1, D7r2, D7r4, salivary apyrase,
      anti-platelet protein, calreticulin, antigen 5 family proteins were identified
      and grouped on the basis of biological and functional roles. Secondly,
      differential protein expression and annotations between salivary glands of sugar 
      fed vs blood fed mosquitoes was analyzed using 2-Delectrophoresis combined with
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The alterations in the differential expression of
      total 38 proteins was observed out of which 29 proteins like beclin-1,
      phosphorylating proteins, heme oxygenase 1, ferritin, apoptotic proteins,
      coagulation and immunity like, serine proteases, serpins, c-type lectin and
      protein in regulation of blood feeding behavior were found to be up regulated
      while 9 proteins related to blood feeding, juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase ii,
      odorant binding proteins and energy metabolic enzymes were found to be down
      regulated. To our knowledge, this study provides a first time baseline proteomic 
      dataset and functional annotations of An. culicifacies salivary gland proteins
      that may be involved during the blood feeding. Identification of differential
      salivary proteins between sugar fed and blood fed mosquitoes and their plausible 
      role may provide insights into the physiological processes associated with
      feeding behavior and sporozoite transmission during the process of blood feeding.

TI  - Anopheline species and their Plasmodium infection status in Aligarh, India.
PG  - 649-53
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.01.005 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a global issue and India contributes substantially to global malaria
      incidence. Information related to malaria vectors is very limited in Aligarh. The
      environmental and climatological situations permit the continual breeding of
      vectors in permanent breeding sites. This study was designed with the aim to
      screen all the anophelines species and possible malaria vectors in three
      different localities of Aligarh. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from three
      different localities (Fort, Jalali and Tappal) during peak malaria transmission
      season (July to November) by using mouth aspirator and CDC light traps.
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done to detect Plasmodium
      falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210 and P. vivax-247 circumsporozoite proteins (CSP)
      from the collected female species. A total of 794 female anopheline mosquitoes
      belonging to 7 species were collected by different methods. Circumsporozoite
      protein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed with 780 anopheline
      mosquitoes out of which 13 mosquitoes were positive in CSP-ELISA. Thus, the
      overall infection rate was 1.66% (13/780). Four (0.51%) mosquitoes belonging to
      three species were positive for P. falciparum, 7 (0.89%) mosquitoes belonging to 
      three species were positive for VK 210 and 2 (0.25%) mosquitoes belonging to
      Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi species were positive for VK 247. 
      No mixed infection was found in this study. According to species, the highest
      infection rate was observed in An. culicifacies (7/288, 2.43%) followed by An.
      stephensi (2.40%) and Anopheles annularis (1.98%). An. culicifacies and An.
      stephensi were previously incriminated as malaria vectors in Aligarh. There was, 
      however, no previous report in favor of infections in An. annularis in Aligarh.
      The on-going Malaria Control Program in India needs up to date information on
      malaria vectors. A major challenge is the lack of knowledge about vectors and
      their role in malaria transmission. Findings of this study suggested that in the 
      absence of major malaria vectors there is a possibility that other Anopheles
      species may have been playing a role in malaria transmission in Aligarh.

TI  - Neem cake as a promising larvicide and adulticide against the rural malaria
      vector Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae): a HPTLC fingerprinting
      approach.

AB  - Mosquitoes are insects of huge public health importance, since they act as
      vectors for important pathogens and parasites. Here, we focused on the
      possibility of using the neem cake in the fight against mosquito vectors. The
      neem cake chemical composition significantly changes among producers, as
      evidenced by our HPTLC (High performance thin layer chromatography) analyses of
      different marketed products. Neem cake extracts were tested to evaluate the
      ovicidal, larvicidal and adulticidal activity against the rural malaria vector
      Anopheles culicifacies. Ovicidal activity of both types of extracts was
      statistically significant, and 150 ppm completely inhibited egg hatching. LC50
      values were extremely low against fourth instar larvae, ranging from 1.321 (NM1) 
      to 1.818 ppm (NA2). Adulticidal activity was also high, with LC50 ranging from
      3.015 (NM1) to 3.637 ppm (NM2). This study pointed out the utility of neem cake
      as a source of eco-friendly mosquitocides in Anopheline vector control
      programmes.

TI  - Eco-friendly larvicides from Indian plants: Effectiveness of lavandulyl acetate
      and bicyclogermacrene on malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis mosquito
      vectors.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a key threat for millions of people and
      animals worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating pathogens and
      parasites, including malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, filiariasis and Zika
      virus. Mosquito young instars are usually targeted using organophosphates, insect
      growth regulators and microbial agents. Indoor residual spraying and
      insecticide-treated bed nets are also employed. However, these chemicals have
      negative effects on human health and the environment and induce resistance in a
      number of vectors. In this scenario, newer and safer tools have been recently
      implemented to enhance mosquito control. The concrete potential of screening
      plant species as sources of metabolites for entomological and parasitological
      purposes is worthy of attention, as recently elucidated by the Y. Tu's example.
      Here we investigated the toxicity of Heracleum sprengelianum (Apiaceae) leaf
      essential oil and its major compounds toward third instar larvae of the malaria
      vector Anopheles subpictus, the arbovirus vector Aedes albopictus and the
      Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. GC-MS analysis showed that 
      EO major components were lavandulyl acetate (17.8%) and bicyclogermacrene
      (12.9%). The EO was toxic to A. subpictus, A. albopictus, and C.
      tritaeniorhynchus, with LC50 of 33.4, 37.5 and 40.9microg/ml, respectively.
      Lavandulyl acetate was more toxic to mosquito larvae if compared to
      bicyclogermacrene. Their LC50 were 4.17 and 10.3microg/ml for A. subpictus, 4.60 
      and 11.1microg/ml for A. albopictus, 5.11 and 12.5microg/ml for C.
      tritaeniorhynchus. Notably, the EO and its major compounds were safer to three
      non-target mosquito predators, Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia
      affinis, with LC50 ranging from 206 to 4219microg/ml. Overall, this study
      highlights that H. sprengelianum EO is a promising source of eco-friendly
      larvicides against three important mosquito vectors with moderate toxicity
      against non-target aquatic organisms.

AB  - Currently, mosquito vector control is facing a number of key challenges,
      including the rapid development of resistance to synthetic pesticides and the
      recent spread of aggressive arbovirus outbreaks. The biosynthesis of silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered an environmental friendly
      alternative to the employ of pyrethroids, carbamates and microbial agents (e.g.
      Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis), since AgNPs are easy to produce,
      effective and stable in the aquatic environment. However, their biophysical
      features showed wide variations according to the botanical agent using for the
      green synthesis, outlining the importance of screening local floral resources
      used as reducing and stabilizing agents. In this study, we focused on the
      biophysical properties and the mosquitocidal action of Quisqualis
      indica-fabricated AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, 
      XRD) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, TEM and EDX) techniques. AFM, SEM and TEM
      confirmed the synthesis of poly-dispersed AgNPs with spherical shape and size
      ranging from 1 to 30nm. XRD shed light on the crystalline structure of these
      AgNPs. The acute toxicity of Quisqualis indica extract and AgNPs was evaluated
      against malaria, arbovirus, and filariasis vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes
      aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, as well as on three important non-target
      aquatic organisms. The Q. indica leaf extract showed moderate larvicidal
      effectiveness on Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=220.42), Ae. aegypti (LC50=203.63)
      and An. stephensi (LC50=185.98). Q. indica-fabricated AgNPs showed high toxicity 
      against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=14.63), Ae. aegypti (LC50=13.55) and An.
      stephensi (LC50=12.52), respectively. Notably, Q. indica-synthesized AgNPs were
      moderately toxic to non-target aquatic mosquito predators Anisops bouvieri
      (LC50=653.05mug/mL), Diplonychus indicus (LC50=860.94mug/mL) and Gambusia affinis
      (LC50=2183.16mug/mL), if compared to the targeted mosquitoes. Overall, the
      proposed one-pot biogenic fabrication of AgNPs using Q. indica is a low-cost and 
      eco-friendly tool in the fight against Zika virus, malaria and filariasis
      vectors, with little impact against non-target aquatic mosquito predators.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) as vectors for important diseases and parasites
      causing millions of deaths every year. The use of synthetic pesticides against
      Culicidae leads to resistance and environmental concerns. Therefore, eco-friendly
      control tools are a priority. In this research, Nicandra physalodes-mediated
      synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was conducted, in order to control
      larval populations of three important mosquito vectors, Anopheles stephensi,
      Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Biofabricated Ag NPs were characterized
      using UV-vis spectrophotometry, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM analyses. Ag
      NPs were highly toxic against the three mosquito vectors. Maximum efficacy was
      detected against A. stephensi (LC50=12.39mug/mL), followed by Ae. aegypti
      (LC50=13.61mug/mL) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=14.79mug/mL). Interestingly, Ag
      NPs were safer for the non-target aquatic organism Diplonychus indicus sharing
      the same aquatic habitats of mosquito larvae. LC50 and LC90 values were 1032.81
      and 19,076.59mug/mL, respectively. Overall, our results highlight that N.
      physalodes-fabricated Ag NPs are a promising for development of eco-friendly
      larvicides against mosquito vectors, with negligible toxicity against non-target 
      aquatic water bugs.

TI  - Drosophila maleless gene counteracts X global aneuploid effects in males.
PG  - 3457-70
LID - 10.1111/febs.13818 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The loss of the entire X chromosome in Drosophila males generates a
      genome-wide aneuploid effect. We have employed a systems biology approach
      (microarray) to investigate the global aneuploid effect of the maleless (mle)
      mutation that disrupts the binding of male specific lethal (MSL) proteins that
      function in dosage compensation. A large number of the genes (144) that encode a 
      broad spectrum of cellular transport proteins and transcription factors are
      located mainly in the autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. We found several such
      targets to be sensitive to the aneuploid effect and conserved with the X
      chromosome in primitive Drosophila species and Anopheles gambiae. During
      evolution, they shifted gradually from their X-chromosomal positions to the
      autosomes in the species D. melanogaster, suggesting that the counteraction of
      trans-acting regulatory modifiers and their targets in two separate chromosomes
      is evolutionarily advantageous. These findings suggest a remarkable and
      previously unexpected level of complexity favoring natural compensation for the
      aneuploid effect. We propose that the MSL complex functions in dosage
      compensation in two separate steps. Initially, X-linked genes including X-linked 
      trans-acting modifiers are hyperactivated in dosage compensated males. Later,
      these compensated modifiers eventually mitigate inverse aneuploid effects for the
      equality in expression of their autosomal targets in males and females. DATABASE:

AB  - Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread malaria parasite. Unique
      features of transmission biology complicate P. vivax control. Interventions
      targeting transmission are required for malaria eradication. In the absence of an
      in vitro culture, transmission studies rely on live isolates from non-human
      primates or endemic regions. Here, we demonstrate P. vivax gametocytes from both 
      India and Brazil are stable during cryopreservation. Importantly, cryopreserved
      gametocytes from Brazil were capable of infecting three anopheline mosquito
      species in feedings done in the United States. These findings create new
      opportunities for transmission studies in diverse locales.

TI  - An experimental hut evaluation of Olyset Plus, a long-lasting insecticidal net
      treated with a mixture of permethrin and piperonyl butoxide, against Anopheles
      fluviatilis in Odisha State, India.
PG  - 375
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1424-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fast development of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors prompted
      the development of new vector control tools including combination of insecticides
      with different modes of action as part of resistance management strategies.
      Olyset Plus(R) is a new long-lasting insecticidal net, in which, permethrin and a
      synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), are incorporated into filaments. Mixture
      nets such as this may have application against resistant mosquitoes, particularly
      those whose resistance is based on oxidative metabolism. There may also be
      enhanced activity against susceptible mosquitoes since mixed function oxidases
      are involved in a many metabolic activities including activation to form
      bioactive compounds. METHODS: Bio-efficacy of Olyset Plus was evaluated against
      susceptible malaria vector, Anopheles fluviatilis in experimental huts.
      Deterrence, blood feeding inhibition, induced exophily and killing effect were
      measured to assess the bio-efficacy. The results were compared with Olyset
      Net(R), a polyethylene permethrin-incorporated LLIN and a conventionally treated 
      polyester net (with permethrin) washed to just before exhaustion. RESULTS:
      Results showed significant reduction in entry (treatment: 0.4-0.8; control: 4.2
      per trap-night) and increase in exit (56.3-82.9 % and 44.2 %) rates of Anopheles 
      fluviatilis in the treatment arms compared to control (P < 0.05). While blood
      feeding rates declined in treatment arms (18.8-30.6 %), it increased in control
      (77.6 %) (P < 0.05). This was further evident from the blood-feeding inhibition
      rates in treatment arms (60.6-90.6 %). Total mortality was significantly higher
      in all treatment arms (96.3-100 %) compared to control arm (2 %) (P < 0.05).
      Chemical analysis for active ingredient (AI) showed retention of 75 and 88 % in
      Olyset plus and Olyset net respectively after 20 washes. Performance of Olyset
      Plus washed 20 times was equal to the CTN and Olyset Net against the susceptible 
      malaria vector An. fluviatilis, fulfilling the WHO efficacy criteria of Phase II 
      evaluation for LLIN. However, the benefit of incorporating PBO and permethrin
      together in a long-lasting treatment could not be demonstrated in the current
      study as the target vector species was fully susceptible to pyrethroids.
      CONCLUSION: Olyset Plus, with its intrinsic bio-efficacy could be an effective
      vector control tool to prevent transmission of malaria by susceptible vectors
      like An. fluviatilis. However, the results of the current study need to be
      further supported by testing the net at village level (Phase III) for community
      acceptability. Before taking the net to village level, it needs to be verified
      whether the net is better than pyrethroid nets in terms of bio-efficacy against
      resistant An. culicifacies, another malaria vector that has developed resistance 
      to synthetic pyrethroids in India.

TI  - Mosquitocidal Effect of Glycosmis pentaphylla Leaf Extracts against Three
      Mosquito Species (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - e0158088
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resistance status of malaria vectors to different classes of
      insecticides used for public health has raised concern for vector control
      programmes. Alternative compounds to supplement the existing tools are important 
      to be searched to overcome the existing resistance and persistence of pesticides 
      in vectors and the environment respectively. The mosquitocidal effects of
      Glycosmis pentaphylla using different solvents of acetone, methanol, chloroform
      and ethyl acetate extracts against three medically important mosquito vectors was
      conducted. METHODS: Glycosmis pentaphylla plant leaves were collected from Kolli 
      Hills, India. The WHO test procedures for larval and adult bioassays were used to
      evaluate extracts against mosquito vectors, and the chemical composition of
      extracts identified using GC-MS analysis. RESULTS: The larvicidal and adulticidal
      activity of G. pentaphylla plant extracts clearly impacted the three species of
      major mosquitoes vectors. Acetone extracts had the highest larvicidal effect
      against An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti with the LC50 and
      LC90 values of 0.0004, 138.54; 0.2669, 73.7413 and 0.0585, 303.746 mg/ml,
      respectively. The LC50 and LC90 adulticide values of G. pentaphylla leaf extracts
      in acetone, methanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate, solvents were as follows for 
      Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi and Ae. Aegypti: 2.957, 5.458, 2.708, and
      4.777, 3.449, 6.676 mg/ml respectively. The chemical composition of G.
      pentaphylla leaf extract has been found in 20 active compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      plant leaf extracts of G. pentaphylla bioactive molecules which are effective and
      can be developed as an eco-friendly approach for larvicides and adulticidal
      mosquitoes vector control. Detailed identification and characterization of
      mosquitocidal effect of individual bioactive molecules ingredient may result into
      biodegradable effective tools for the control of mosquito vectors.

TI  - Molecular docking and simulation studies of gustatory receptor of Aedes aegypti: 
      A potent drug target to distract host-seeking behaviour in mosquitoes.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: It is well reported that exhaled CO 2 and skin odour
      from human being assist female mosquitoes to locate human host. Basically, the
      receptors for this activity are expressed in cpA neurons. In both Aedes aegypti
      and Anopheles gambiae, this CO 2-sensitive olfactory neuron detects myriad number
      of chemicals present in human skin. Therefore, manipulation of gustatory
      receptors housing these neurons may serve as important targets for behavioural
      intervention. The study was aimed towards virtual screening of small molecules in
      the analyzed conserved active site residues of gustatory receptor and molecular
      dynamics simulation study of optimum protein-ligand complex to identify a
      suitable lead molecule for distracting host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes.
      METHODS: The conserved residue analysis of gustatory receptor (GR) of Ae. aegypti
      and An. gambiae was performed. The structure of GR protein from Ae. aegypti was
      modeled and validated, and then molecular docking was performed to screen 2903
      small molecules against the predicted active residues of GR. Further, simulation 
      studies were also carried out to prove protein-ligand stability. RESULTS: The
      glutamine 154 residue of GR was found to be highly conserved in Ae. aegypti and
      An. gambiae. Docking results indicated that the dodecanoic acid,
      1,2,3-propanetriyl ester (dynasan 112) was interacting with this residue, as it
      showed better LibDock score than previously reported ethyl acetate used as
      mosquito repellant. Simulation studies indicated the structural instability of GR
      protein in docked form with dynasan 112 suggesting its involvement in structural 
      changes. Based on the interaction energies and stability, this compound has been 
      proposed to be used in mosquitoes' repellant. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A
      novel effective odorant acting as inhibitor of GR is proposed based on its
      stability, docking score, interactions and RMSD, considering ethyl pyruvate as a 
      standard inhibitor. Host preference and host-seeking ability of mosquito vectors 
      play key roles in disease transmission, a clear understanding of these aspects is
      essential for preventing the spread of the disease.

AB  - Mosquitoes are arthropods of huge medical and veterinary relevance, since they
      vector pathogens and parasites of public health importance, including malaria,
      dengue and Zika virus. Currently, nanotechnology is considered a potential
      eco-friendly approach in mosquito control research. We proposed a novel method of
      biofabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using chitosan (Ch) from crab
      shells. Ch-AgNP nanocomposite was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR,
      SEM, EDX and XRD. Ch-AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria
      vector Anopheles stephensi obtaining LC50 ranging from 3.18 ppm (I) to 6.54 ppm
      (pupae). The antibacterial properties of Ch-AgNP were proved against Bacillus
      subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, while no growth inhibition 
      was reported in assays conducted on Proteus vulgaris. Concerning non-target
      effects, in standard laboratory considtions the predation efficiency of Danio
      rerio zebrafishes was 68.8% and 61.6% against I and II instar larvae of A.
      stephensi, respectively. In a Ch-AgNP-contaminated environment, fish predation
      was boosted to 89.5% and 77.3%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of
      antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and LPO from hepatopancreas of fresh water crabs
      Paratelphusa hydrodromous exposed for 16 days to a Ch-AgNP-contaminated aquatic
      environment were conducted. Notably, deleterious effects of Ch-AgNP contaminating
      aquatic enviroment on the non-target crab P. hydrodromous were observed,
      particularly when doses higher than 8-10ppm are tested. Overall, this research
      highlights the potential of Ch-AGNP for the development of newer control tools
      against young instar populations of malaria mosquitoes, also highlighting some
      risks concerned the employ of nanoparticles in aquatic environments.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors of important pathogens and parasites,
      including malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, lymphatic
      filariasis and Zika virus. The application of synthetic insecticides causes
      development of resistance, biological magnification of toxic substances through
      the food chain, and adverse effects on the environment and human health. In this 
      scenario, eco-friendly control tools of mosquito vectors are a priority. Here
      single-step fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap aqueous leaf
      extract of Zornia diphylla as reducing and capping agent pf Ag(+) ions has been
      carried out. Biosynthesized AgNP were characterized by UV-visible
      spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
      energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The
      acute toxicity of Z. diphylla leaf extract and biosynthesized AgNP was evaluated 
      against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the dengue vector Aedes
      albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Both the
      Z. diphylla leaf extract and Ag NP showed dose dependent larvicidal effect
      against all tested mosquito species. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract,
      biosynthesized Ag NP showed higher toxicity against An. subpictus, Ae.
      albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus with LC50 values of 12.53, 13.42 and
      14.61mug/ml, respectively. Biosynthesized Ag NP were found safer to non-target
      organisms Chironomus circumdatus, Anisops bouvieri and Gambusia affinis, with the
      respective LC50 values ranging from 613.11 to 6903.93mug/ml, if compared to
      target mosquitoes. Overall, our results highlight that Z. diphylla-fabricated Ag 
      NP are a promising and eco-friendly tool against larval populations of mosquito
      vectors of medical and veterinary importance, with negligible toxicity against
      other non-target organisms.

TI  - Screening of Methanolic Plant Extracts against Larvae of Aedes aegypti and
      Anopheles stephensi in Mysore.
PG  - 303-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of death
      every year. Vector control is facing a threat due to the emergence of resistance 
      to synthetic insecticides. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable
      alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. Nine different locally available
      medicinally important plants suspected to posse larvicidal property were screened
      against fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi to a series
      of concentrations of the methanolic extracts. METHODS: Susceptibility tests on
      Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi were conducted using standard WHO methods. The
      larvae of two mosquito species were exposed to methanolic extracts and mortality 
      counts were made after 24 hours of exposure as per WHO method. Larvae of Ae.
      aegypti were more susceptible than that of An. stephensi. RESULTS: Among the nine
      plant species tested, Annona reticulata leaf extract was more effective against
      Ae. aegypti larvae with LC50 and LC90 values of 95.24 and 262.64 ppm respectively
      and against An. stephensi larvae 262.71 and 636.94 ppm respectively. The least
      efficacy was in Cosmos bipinnatus with LC50 and LC90 values of 442.6 and 1225.93 
      ppm against Ae. aegypti and LC50 and LC90 values of 840.69 and 1334.01 ppm of
      Thespesia populnea against An. stephensi. CONCLUSION: The crude methanolic
      extract of the An. reticulata with good larvicidal efficacy could be considered
      for further characterization to control mosquito vectors instead of chemical
      insecticides. High efficacy found in An. reticulata extract will be considered
      for further studies to isolate the bioactive compound.

AB  - Malaria transmission is a serious emergence in urban and semiurban areas
      worldwide, becoming a major international public health concern. Malaria is
      transmitted through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. The extensive employ of
      synthetic pesticides leads to negative effects on human health and the
      environment. Recently, plant-synthesized nanoparticles have been proposed as
      highly effective mosquitocides. In this research, we synthesized silver
      nanoparticles (AgNP) using the Azadirachta indica seed kernel extract as reducing
      and stabilizing agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, SEM, 
      EDX, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. The A. indica seed kernel extract was toxic
      against Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae, LC50 were 232.8ppm (larva I),
      260.6ppm (II), 290.3ppm (III), 323.4ppm (IV), and 348.4ppm (pupa). AgNP LC50 were
      3.9ppm (I), 4.9ppm (II), 5.6ppm (III), 6.5ppm (IV), and 8.2ppm (pupa). The
      antiplasmodial activity of A. indica seed kernel extract and AgNP was evaluated
      against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium
      falciparum. IC50 of A. indica seed kernel extract were 63.18mug/ml (CQ-s) and
      69.24mug/ml (CQ-r). A. indica seed kernel-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50, of
      82.41mug/ml (CQ-s) and 86.12mug/ml (CQ-r). However, in vivo anti-plasmodial
      experiments conducted on Plasmodium berghei infecting albino mice showed moderate
      activity of the A. indica extract and AgNP. Overall, this study showed that the
      A. indica-mediated fabrication of AgNP is of interest for a wide array of
      purposes, ranging from IPM of mosquito vectors to the development of novel and
      cheap antimalarial drugs.

AB  - Plant-borne compounds have been proposed for extracellular synthesis of
      mosquitocidal nanoparticles. However, their impact against mosquito natural
      enemies has been scarcely studied. Here, we synthesised silver nanoparticles (Ag 
      NPs) using Mussaenda glabra leaf extract as reducing and stabilising agent.
      Biofabricated Ag NPs were characterised by UV-vis spectrophotometry, X-ray
      diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compared to the leaf
      aqueous extract, biosynthesised Ag NPs showed higher toxicity against mosquito
      vectors Anopheles subpictus, Aedes albopictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus with
      LC50 of 17-19 mug/mL, respectively. Ag NPs were found safer to non-target
      organisms Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with respective LC50 values
      ranging from 1446 to 8628 mug/mL. Overall, M. glabra-fabricated Ag NPs are a
      promising and eco-friendly tool against larval populations of mosquito vectors of
      medical and veterinary importance, with negligible toxicity against other
      non-target aquatic organisms.

TI  - Eco-friendly drugs from the marine environment: spongeweed-synthesized silver
      nanoparticles are highly effective on Plasmodium falciparum and its vector
      Anopheles stephensi, with little non-target effects on predatory copepods.
PG  - 16671-85

AB  - Mosquitoes act as vectors of devastating pathogens and parasites, representing a 
      key threat for millions of humans and animals worldwide. The control of
      mosquito-borne diseases is facing a number of crucial challenges, including the
      emergence of artemisinin and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium parasites, as
      well as the presence of mosquito vectors resistant to synthetic and microbial
      pesticides. Therefore, eco-friendly tools are urgently required. Here, a synergic
      approach relying to nanotechnologies and biological control strategies is
      proposed. The marine environment is an outstanding reservoir of bioactive natural
      products, which have many applications against pests, parasites, and pathogens.
      We proposed a novel method of seaweed-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles 
      (AgNP) using the spongeweed Codium tomentosum, acting as a reducing and capping
      agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
      (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray 
      spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In mosquitocidal assays, the 50 
      % lethal concentration (LC50) of C. tomentosum extract against Anopheles
      stephensi ranged from 255.1 (larva I) to 487.1 ppm (pupa). LC50 of C.
      tomentosum-synthesized AgNP ranged from 18.1 (larva I) to 40.7 ppm (pupa). In
      laboratory, the predation efficiency of Mesocyclops aspericornis copepods against
      A. stephensi larvae was 81, 65, 17, and 9 % (I, II, III, and IV instar,
      respectively). In AgNP contaminated environment, predation was not affected; 83, 
      66, 19, and 11 % (I, II, III, and IV). The anti-plasmodial activity of C.
      tomentosum extract and spongeweed-synthesized AgNP was evaluated against
      CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum.
      Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) of C. tomentosum were 51.34 mug/ml 
      (CQ-s) and 65.17 mug/ml (CQ-r); C. tomentosum-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50 of
      72.45 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 76.08 mug/ml (CQ-r). Furthermore, low doses of the AgNP
      inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella 
      typhi, using the agar disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration
      protocol. Overall, C. tomentosum metabolites and spongeweed-synthesized AgNP may 
      be potential candidates to develop novel and effective tools in the fight against
      Plasmodium parasites and their mosquito vectors. The employ of ultra-low doses of
      nanomosquitocides in synergy with cyclopoid crustaceans seems a promising green
      route for effective mosquito control programs.

TI  - Overhead tank is the potential breeding habitat of Anopheles stephensi in an
      urban transmission setting of Chennai, India.
PG  - 274
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1321-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wells and overhead tanks (OHT) are the major breeding sources of the 
      local malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi in the Indian city of Chennai; they
      play a significant role in vector breeding, and transmission of urban malaria.
      Many other man-made breeding habitats, such as cemented cisterns/containers,
      barrels or drums, sumps or underground tanks, and plastic pots/containers are
      maintained to supplement water needs, temporarily resulting in enhanced
      mosquito/vector breeding. Correlating breeding habitats with immature vector
      abundance is important in effective planning to strengthen operational execution 
      of vector control measures. METHODS: A year-long, weekly study was conducted in
      Chennai to inspect available clear/clean water mosquito breeding habitats.
      Different breeding features, such as instar-wise, immature density and
      co-inhabitation with other mosquito species, were analysed. The characteristics
      of breeding habitats, i.e., type of habitat, water temperature and presence of
      aquatic organisms, organic matter and green algal remnants on the water surface
      at the time of inspection, were also studied. Immature density of vector was
      correlated with presence of other mosquito species, malaria prevalence, habitat
      characteristics and monthly/seasonal fluctuations. All the data collected from
      field observations were analysed using standard statistical tools. RESULTS: When 
      the immature density of breeding habitats was analysed, using one-way ANOVA, it
      was observed that the density did not change in a significant way either across
      seasons or months. OHTs contributed significantly to the immature population when
      compared to wells and other breeding habitats of the study site. The habitat
      positivity of wells and OHTs was significantly associated with the presence of
      aquatic organisms, organic matter and algal remnants. Significant correlations of
      malaria prevalence with monthly immature density, as well as number of breeding
      habitats with immature vector mosquitoes, were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings that OHTs showed fairly high and consistent immature density of An.
      stephensi irrespective of seasons indicates the potentiality of the breeding
      habitat in contributing to vector density. The correlation between vector
      breeding habitats, immature density and malaria prevalence indicates the
      proximity of these habitats to malaria cases, proving its role in vector
      abundance and local malaria transmission. The preference of An. stephensi to
      breed in OHTs calls for intensified, appropriate and sustained intervention
      measures to curtail vector breeding and propagation to shrink malaria to
      pre-elimination level and beyond.

      environmental concerns. In this scenario, plants employed in traditional Asian
      medicine may be alternative sources of newer and effective mosquitocides. In this
      research, we evaluated the larvicidal activity of Kadsura heteroclita leaf
      essential oil (EO) and its major chemical constituents (delta-Cadinene, Calarene 
      and delta-4-Carene) against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue
      vector Aedes aegypti and the filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The
      chemical composition of the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass
      spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the essential oil of K. heteroclita contained
      33 compounds. The major chemical components were delta-Cadinene (18.3%), Calarene
      (14.8%) and delta-4-Carene (12.5%). The EO had a significant toxic effect against
      early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, 
      with LC50 values of 102.86, 111.79 and 121.97 microg/mL. The three major
      constituents extracted from the K. heteroclita EO were tested individually for
      acute toxicity against larvae of the three mosquito vectors. delta-Cadinene,
      Calarene and delta-4-Carene appeared most effective against An. stephensi (LC50 =
      8.23, 12.34 and 16.37 microg/mL, r espectively) followed by Ae. aegypti (LC50 =
      9.03, 13.33 and 17.91 microg/mL), and Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50; = 9.86, 14.49
      and 19.50 microg/mL). Overall, this study adds knowledge to develop newer and
      safer natural larvicides against malaria, dengue and filariasis mosquito.

TI  - A Critical Review of All Known Published Records for Water Mite (Acari:
      Hydrachnidiae) and Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Parasitic Associations From 1975
      to Present.
PG  - 737-752
AB  - All published records of water mite-mosquito parasitic associations since Gary R.
      Mullen's comprehensive review in the 1970s of the literature were critiqued to
      provide an up-to-date account on the identity of water mites parasitizing
      mosquitoes and their geographic distribution. In total, 321 records in 62 sources
      were identified, with each record representing an association specific to a
      state, province, or region within a country. The greatest number of records were 
      from the United States (120), followed by India (106) and Canada (40). In all,
      105 species of mosquitoes were parasitized, with the majority belonging to the
      genera Aedes sensu lato (30), Anopheles (30), and Culex (21). Records were biased
      toward mosquito genera with the greatest number of freshwater species and medical
      importance. Most water mites belonged to the genus Arrenurus, or were Parathyas
      barbigera (Viets 1908). Arrenurus water mites were often not identified to
      species, but 15 different Arrenurus species were determined in 119 records. All
      but one of the species (i.e., Arrenurus madaraszi Daday 1898) were only reported 
      from Canada, Germany, or the United States. Although a greater proportion of
      sources reviewed by us compared with Mullen's review identified water mites down 
      to the level of genus, to better understand the biological significance of mite
      and mosquito interactions, more of an effort is needed to identify the species of
      water mites. The availability of molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding will 
      make this goal more attainable.

TI  - Malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies sibling species differentiation using egg
      morphometry and morphology.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.1186/s13071-016-1478-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies (sensu lato) is an
      important malaria vector in Southeast Asia which comprises of five sibling
      species namely A, B, C, D and E. However, only a few forms have been identified
      as malaria vectors in various endemic countries. Currently, for the first time
      egg morphometry and morphology has been used to differentiate the three known
      vector sibling species of Anopheles culicifacies collected from malaria endemic
      Madhya Pradesh state of central India. METHODS: The adult An. culicifacies (s.l.)
      was collected from five districts using standard mosquito collection methods.
      Adult female mosquitoes were allowed to lay eggs individually. The emerged
      mosquitoes were identified using allele specific polymerase chain reaction
      (AS-PCR) to sibling species. Eggs of sibling species A, D and E were studied
      using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphometric and morphological
      characteristics. RESULTS: Currently AS-PCR identified four known sibling species 
      (B, C, D and E) of An. culicifacies in the study area. The surface morphology and
      morphometric attributes of the sibling species A, D and E eggs considerably
      differed from each other. An. culicifacies E had a narrow deck as compared to A
      and D, while An. culicifacies A had a bigger micropyle with 6-7 sectors as
      compared to D and E that had 6 sectors. An. culicifacies D had the smallest float
      (the structure present on sides of the egg surface in which air is filled that
      help in floating) and the number of ribs was also fewer than for An. culicifacies
      A and E. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the first evidence that in
      addition to PCR assay, sibling species of An. culicifacies can also be
      differentiated using morphological and morphometric characteristics of the egg
      stage. The results also advocate that the sibling species of An. culicifacies are
      morphologically dissimilar and can be resolved using advanced microscopy.

AB  - The synthesis of eco-friendly nanoparticles is evergreen branch of nanoscience
      with a growing number of biomedical implications. In this study, we investigated 
      the synthesis of polydisperse and stable silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a
      cheap leaf extract of Malva sylvestris (Malvaceae). Bio-reduced AgNP were
      characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), atomic force microscopy
      (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM). The acute toxicity of M. sylvestris leaf extract and green-synthesized
      AgNP was evaluated against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the 
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus.
      Compared to the leaf aqueous extract, AgNP showed higher toxicity against A.
      stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with LC50 values of 10.33, 11.23, 
      and 12.19 mug/mL, respectively. Green-synthesized AgNP were found safer to
      non-target organisms Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with respective
      LC50 values ranging from 813.16 to 1044.52 mug/mL. Overall, this research firstly
      shed light on the mosquitocidal potential of M. sylvestris, a potential
      bio-resource for rapid, cheap and effective synthesis of polydisperse and highly 
      stable silver nanocrystals.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious pathogens and parasites to humans and animals,
      including malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and filariasis. The extensive
      use of chemical pesticides leads to the development of resistance in mosquito
      vector populations and serious non-target effects on human health and the
      environment. Myrtaceae plants can be a useful reservoir of natural products
      effective against Culicidae young instars. In this research, we evaluated the
      mosquitocidal potential of the essential oil (EO) from Syzygium zeylanicum leaves
      against larvae of three mosquitoes of medical and veterinary importance, the
      malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the dengue vector Aedes albopictus, and the
      Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The chemical composition of
      the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that 
      the S. zeylanicum EO contained at least 18 compounds. The major chemical
      components were alpha-humulene (37.8.5 %) and beta-elemene (10.7 %). The EO had a
      significant toxic effect against early third-stage larvae of An. subpictus, Ae.
      albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, with LC50 values of 83.11, 90.45, and
      97.96 mug/ml, respectively. The two major constituents extracted from the S.
      zeylanicum EO were tested individually for acute toxicity against larvae of the
      three mosquito vectors. alpha-Humulene and beta-elemene appeared highly effective
      against An. subpictus (LC50 = 6.19 and 10.26 mug/ml, respectively), followed by
      Ae. albopictus (LC50 = 6.86 and 11.15 mug/ml) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 =
      7.39 and 12.05 mug/ml). Furthermore, the EO and its major components was safe
      towards the non-target fish Gambusia affinis; LC50 values were 20374.26, 1024.95,
      and 2073.18 mug/ml, respectively for EO, alpha-humulene and beta-elemene.
      Overall, this study highlighted that the acute toxicity of S. zeylanicum EO
      towards mosquito larvae was mainly due to the presence of alpha-humulene and
      beta-elemene. Furthermore, we pointed out the concrete possibility to exploit
      these two compounds from S. zeylanicum EO as highly effective larvicides against 
      young instars of An. subpictus, Ae. albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, with
      little effect on non-target organisms.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of various mosquito vectors is important in the
      determination of disease prevalence in disease endemic areas. The aim of the
      present study was to conduct regular entomological surveillance and to determine 
      the relative abundance of tree hole mosquito species in Tamilnadu, India. In
      addition to this, the impact of weather-conditions on tree hole mosquito
      population were evaluated between June, 2014 and May, 2015. Six hills ranges
      viz., Anaimalai hills, Kodaikanal hills, Sitheri hills, Kolli hills, Yercaud
      hills, and Megamalai were selected, the immatures collected from tree holes by
      the help of suction tube. Collections were made at dusk and dawn at randomly
      selected 15 different tree species. The collected samples were stored and
      morphologically identified to species level in the laboratory. Mosquito diversity
      was calculated by Simpson's and Shannon-Weiner diversity indicies with spatial
      and temporal aspects. Over 2642 mosquitoes comprising the primary vectors of
      dengue, chickungunya, malaria, filariasis were identified. Other species
      collected from the fifteen sites in each hill during the study included
      Christophersiomyia annularis, Christophersiomyia thomsoni, Downsiomyia
      albolateralis, Downsiomyia nivea and Toxorhynchites splendens, etc. Study
      revealed high species diversity and relative density associated with different
      study sites. Based on the Shannon diversity index high number of species was
      recorded with Aedes pseudoalbopicta (0.0829) followed by Ae. aegypti (0.0805) and
      least species was recorded as Anopheles elegans (0.0059). The distribution of the
      primary vectors of DF along the high occurrence was evident with most study sites
      representing proportions of this vector population. This showed the high risk
      level associated with the livestock movement in amplification and circulation of 
      the virus during the outbreaks. The findings of this study, therefore,
      demonstrated the potential vulnerability of nomadic communities to infection by
      arboviral diseases transmitted by mosquito vectors.

AB  - During the recent past, development of DDT resistance and reduction to pyrethroid
      susceptibility among the malaria vectors has posed a serious challenge in many
      Southeast Asian countries including India. Current study presents the insecticide
      susceptibility and knock-down data of field collected Anopheles annularis sensu
      lato and An. vagus mosquito species from endemic areas of Assam in northeast
      India. Anopheles annularis s.l. and An. vagus adult females were collected from
      four randomly selected sentinel sites in Orang primary health centre (OPHC) and
      Balipara primary health centre (BPHC) areas, and used for testing susceptibility 
      to DDT, malathion, deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin. After insecticide
      susceptibility tests, mosquitoes were subjected to VectorTest assay kits to
      detect the presence of malaria sporozoite in the mosquitoes. An. annularis s.l.
      was completely susceptible to deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and malathion in
      both the study areas. An. vagus was highly susceptible to deltamethrin in both
      the areas, but exhibited reduced susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin in BPHC.
      Both the species were resistant to DDT and showed very high KDT50 and KDT99
      values for DDT. Probit model used to calculate the KDT50 and KDT99 values did not
      display normal distribution of percent knock-down with time for malathion in both
      the mosquito species in OPHC (p<0.05) and An. vagus in BPHC (chi2 = 25.3; p =
      0.0), and also for deltamethrin to An. vagus in BPHC area (chi2 = 15.4; p =
      0.004). Minimum infection rate (MIR) of Plasmodium sporozoite for An. vagus was
      0.56 in OPHC and 0.13 in BPHC, while for An. annularis MIR was found to be 0.22
      in OPHC. Resistance management strategies should be identified to delay the
      expansion of resistance. Testing of field caught Anopheles vectors from different
      endemic areas for the presence of malaria sporozoite may be useful to ensure
      their role in malaria transmission.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors of important parasites and pathogens 
      causing death, poverty and social disability worldwide, with special reference to
      tropical and subtropical countries. The overuse of synthetic insecticides to
      control mosquito vectors lead to resistance, adverse environmental effects and
      high operational costs. Therefore, the development of eco-friendly control tools 
      is an important public health challenge. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal
      activity of Pinus kesiya leaf essential oil (EO) was evaluated against the
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the
      lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of
      the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that 
      the P. kesiya EO contained 18 compounds. Major constituents were alpha-pinene,
      beta-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D. In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed
      significant toxicity against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae.
      aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with LC50 values of 52, 57, and 62microg/ml,
      respectively. Notably, the EO was safer towards several aquatic non-target
      organisms Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC50
      values ranging from 4135 to 8390microg/ml. Overall, this research adds basic
      knowledge to develop newer and safer natural larvicides from Pinaceae plants
      against malaria, dengue and filariasis mosquito vectors.

AB  - The interaction of mosquito immune system with Plasmodium is critical in
      determining the vector competence. Thus, blocking the crucial mosquito molecules 
      that regulate parasite development might be effective in controlling the disease 
      transmission. In this study, we characterized a full-length AsHPX15 gene from the
      major Indian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. This gene is true ortholog of
      Anopheles gambiae heme peroxidase AgHPX15 (AGAP013327), which modulates midgut
      immunity and regulates Plasmodium falciparum development. We found that AsHPX15
      is highly induced in mosquito developmental stages and blood fed midguts. In
      addition, this is a lineage-specific gene that has identical features and 65-99% 
      amino acids identity with other HPX15 genes present in eighteen
      worldwide-distributed anophelines. We discuss that the conserved HPX15 gene might
      serve as a common target to manipulate mosquito immunity and arresting Plasmodium
      development inside the vector host.

AB  - The larvicidal activity of Mentha piperita, Cymbopogan citratus (lemongrass),
      Eucalyptus globulus and Citrus sinensis (orange) essential oils and their
      combinations was evaluated against Musca domestica (housefly) and Anopheles
      stephensi (mosquitoes) through contact toxicity assay. Among all the tested
      essential oils/combinations, Me. piperita was found to be the most effective
      larvicidal agent against Mu. domestica and An. stephensi with LC50 values of 0.66
      mul/cm(2) and 44.66 ppm, respectively, after 48 h. The results clearly
      highlighted that the addition of mentha oil to other oils (1:1 ratio) improved
      their larvicidal activity. The order of effectiveness of essential
      oils/combinations indicated that the pattern for An. stephensi follows the trend 
      as mentha > mentha + lemongrass > lemongrass > mentha + eucalyptus > eucalyptus >
      mentha + orange > orange and for Mu. domestica as mentha > mentha + lemongrass > 
      lemongrass > mentha + orange > orange > mentha + eucalyptus > eucalyptus. The
      images obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated the
      toxic effect of Me. piperita as the treated larvae were observed to be dehydrated
      and deformed. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of tested essential
      oils/combinations against the larval stages of Mu. domestica and An. stephensi
      and has the potential for development of botanical formulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: India contributes 1.5-2 million annual confirmed cases of malaria.
      Since both parasites and vectors are evolving rapidly, updated information on
      parasite prevalence in mosquitoes is important for vector management and disease 
      control. Possible new vector-parasite interactions in Goa, India were tested.
      METHODS: A total of 1036 CDC traps were placed at four malaria endemic foci in
      Goa, India from May 2013 to April 2015. These captured 23,782 mosquitoes, of
      which there were 1375 female anopheline specimens with ten species identified
      using morphological keys. Mosquito DNA was analysed for human and bovine blood as
      well as for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection. RESULTS: Human 
      host feeding was confirmed in Anopheles stephensi (30 %), Anopheles subpictus (27
      %), Anopheles jamesii (22 %), Anopheles annularis (26 %), and Anopheles
      nigerrimus (16 %). In contrast, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles barbirostris,
      Anopheles tessellates, Anopheles umbrosus and Anopheles karwari specimens were
      negative for human blood. Importantly, An. subpictus, which was considered a
      non-vector in Goa and Western India, was found to be a dominant vector in terms
      of both total number of mosquitoes collected as well as Plasmodium carriage.
      Plasmodium infections were detected in 14 An. subpictus (2.8 %), while the
      traditional vector, An. stephensi, showed seven total infections, two of which
      were in the salivary glands. Of the 14 An. subpictus infections, nested PCR
      demonstrated three Plasmodium infections in the salivary glands: one P. vivax and
      two mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, ten gut
      infections (one P. vivax, six P. falciparum and three mixed infections) were seen
      in An. subpictus. Longitudinal mosquito collections pointed to a bimodal annual
      appearance of An. subpictus to maintain a perennial malaria transmission cycle of
      both P. vivax and P. falciparum in Goa.

AB  - Hemocytes are tiny circulating blood cells of insects known to play multiple
      roles in physiological as well as cellular immune responses. However, the
      molecular nature of hemocytes in blood feeding insects, especially mosquitoes
      which transmit several deadly diseases such as malaria, dengue etc. is still
      limited. Therefore, to know the basic molecular composition of naive mosquito
      hemocyte encoded proteins, we sequenced RNA-Seq library and analyzed a total of
      13,105,858 Illumina sequencing reads in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, an
      urban malarial vector in India. Denovo assembly approach yielded a buildup of
      3025 contigs, for molecular and functional annotation. A total of 1829 contigs
      (48%) could be mapped to the mosquito transcript database, while out of remaining
      1196 unmatched contigs, at least 1108 contigs i.e. 40% of total contigs, yielded 
      a significant match to the available draft genome. ImmunoDB analysis predicted a 
      total of 88 putative hemocyte transcripts belonging to 11 immune family proteins.
      A comprehensive molecular analysis of several unique transcripts including novel 
      LRR, Holotricin, OBP, NiFU, that are involved in immunity, chemo sensing,
      cell-cell communication, nitrogen fixation/metabolism etc. provides initial
      evidence that mosquito hemocytes carry unique ability to meet and manage cell
      specific diverse functions of the mosquito blood. An unexpected observation of
      abundant transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins with unknown functions
      indicated that a much of the hemocyte biology remains to be understood.

PG  - S64-70
LID - 10.4103/0971-5916.176624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Due to ever growing insecticide resistance in mosquitoes
      to commonly used insecticides in many parts of the globe, there is always a need 
      for introduction of new insecticides for the control of resistant vector
      mosquitoes. In this study, larvicidal and adulticidal efficacies of three
      neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam) were tested against
      resistant and susceptible populations of Anopheles stephensi Liston 1901, Aedes
      (Stegomyia) aegypti Linnaeus, and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera:
      Culicidae). METHODS: Laboratory-reared mosquito species were used. Insecticide
      susceptibility tests were done using standard WHO procedures and using diagnostic
      dosages of insecticide test papers and larvicides. Adulticidal efficacy of
      candidate insecticides was assessed using topical application method and larval
      bioassays were conducted using standard WHO procedure. RESULTS: The results of
      topical application on 3-5 day old female mosquitoes indicated that resistant
      strain of An. stephensi registered lower LC 50 values than the susceptible
      strain. Among the three insecticides tested, thiacloprid was found more effective
      than the other two insecticides. Culex quinquefasciatus registered lowest LC 50
      for imidacloprid than the other two mosquito species tested. In larval bioassays,
      the LC 50 values registered for imidacloprid were in the order of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus < An. stephensi (SS) < An. stephensi (RR) < Ae. aegypti. In case
      of thiacloprid, the order of efficacy (LC 50 ) was Cx. quinquefasciatus < An.
      stephensi (SS) < An. stephensi (RR), whereas in case of thiamethoxam, the
      larvicidal efficacy was in the order of An. stephensi (RR) < An. stephensi (SS) <
      Cx. quinquefasciatus. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated
      that insecticide resistant strains of mosquito species tested showed more
      susceptibility to the three neonicotinoids tested, and the possibility of using
      neonicotinoids for the control of resistant mosquitoes should be explored.

TI  - Triple insecticide resistance in Anopheles culicifacies: A practical impediment
      for malaria control in Odisha State, India.
PG  - S59-63
LID - 10.4103/0971-5916.176621 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In Odisha State, the control of malaria vectors has
      become dependent on synthetic pyrethroids, which are used for treatment of all
      approved long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). The vast use of just one class
      of insecticide has led to the problem of resistance to insecticides in malaria
      vectors. One of the major malaria vectors in Odisha State is Anopheles
      culicifacies Giles. The aim of this study was to determine the resistance status 
      of An. culicifacies to deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid and other common
      insecticides used by the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme
      (NVBDCP) for indoor residual spraying in Odisha State. METHODS: Mosquitoes were
      collected during April 2014 - June 2014 from 15 randomly selected villages in
      five p0 lasmodium falciparum endemic southern districts of Odisha State. The
      blood-fed wild caught females were exposed to the diagnostic dosage of DDT
      (4.0%), malathion (5.0%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) for one hour. Mortality was
      recorded at 24 h after the exposure. RESULTS: Results indicated that An.
      culicifacies was resistant to all the three insecticides used in the malaria
      control programme in the five districts of Odisha State. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSIONS: Resistance management strategy by appropriate rotation of different 
      groups of insecticides including carbamates and incorporating a synergist with
      synthetic pyrethroids for treating mosquito nets should be considered for the
      control of malaria vectors in the area, especially where An. culicifacies is
      predominant. Periodical monitoring of susceptibility/resistance status of An.
      culicifacies to different insecticides is warranted.

PG  - S12-22
LID - 10.4103/0971-5916.176597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is a major public health problem in Tripura and 
      focal disease outbreaks are of frequent occurrence. The state is co-endemic for
      both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax and transmission is perennial and
      persistent. The present study was aimed to review data on disease distribution to
      prioritize high-risk districts, and to study seasonal prevalence of disease
      vectors and their bionomical characteristics to help formulate vector
      species-specific interventions for malaria control. METHODS: Data on malaria
      morbidity in the State were reviewed retrospectively (2008-2012) for
      understanding disease distribution and transmission dynamics. Cross-sectional
      mass blood surveys were conducted in malaria endemic villages of South Tripura
      district to ascertain the prevalence of malaria and proportions of parasite
      species. Mosquito collections were made in human dwellings of malaria endemic
      villages aiming at vector incrimination and to study relative abundance, resting 
      and feeding preferences, and their present susceptibility status to DDT. RESULTS:
      The study showed that malaria was widely prevalent and P. falciparum was the
      predominant infection (>90%), the remaining were P. vivax cases. The disease
      distribution, however, was uneven with large concentration of cases in districts 
      of South Tripura and Dhalai coinciding with vast forest cover and tribal
      populations. Both Anopheles minimus s.s. and An. baimaii were recorded to be
      prevalent and observed to be highly anthropophagic and susceptible to DDT. Of
      these, An. minimus was incriminated (sporozoite infection rate 4.92%), and its
      bionomical characteristics revealed this species to be largely indoor resting and
      endophagic. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: For effective control of malaria in the
      state, it is recommended that diseases surveillance should be robust, and vector 
      control interventions including DDT spray coverage, mass distribution of
      insecticide-treated nets/ long-lasting insecticidal nets should be intensified
      prioritizing population groups most at risk to avert impending disease outbreaks 
      and spread of drug-resistant malaria.

AB  - The development of parasites and pathogens resistant to synthetic drugs
      highlighted the needing of novel, eco-friendly and effective control approaches. 
      Recently, metal nanoparticles have been proposed as highly effective tools
      towards cancer cells and Plasmodium parasites. In this study, we synthesized
      silver nanoparticles (EW-AgNP) using Eudrilus eugeniae earthworms as reducing and
      stabilizing agents. EW-AgNP showed plasmon resonance reduction in UV-vis
      spectrophotometry, the functional groups involved in the reduction were studied
      by FTIR spectroscopy, while particle size and shape was analyzed by FESEM. The
      effect of EW-AgNP on in vitro HepG2 cell proliferation was measured using MTT
      assays. Apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry showed diminished endurance of HepG2
      cells and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. EW-AgNP were toxic to
      Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae, LC(50) were 4.8 ppm (I), 5.8 ppm (II), 6.9 
      ppm (III), 8.5 ppm (IV), and 15.5 ppm (pupae). The antiplasmodial activity of
      EW-AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains
      of Plasmodium falciparum. EW-AgNP IC(50) were 49.3 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 55.5 mug/ml 
      (CQ-r), while chloroquine IC(50) were 81.5 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 86.5 mug/ml (CQ-r). 
      EW-AgNP showed a valuable antibiotic potential against important pathogenic
      bacteria and fungi. Concerning non-target effects of EW-AgNP against mosquito
      natural enemies, the predation efficiency of the mosquitofish Gambusia affinis
      towards the II and II instar larvae of A. stephensi was 68.50% (II) and 47.00%
      (III), respectively. In EW-AgNP-contaminated environments, predation was boosted 
      to 89.25% (II) and 70.75% (III), respectively. Overall, this research highlighted

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people
      worldwide. However, the use of synthetic insecticides to control Culicidae may
      lead to resistance, high operational costs and adverse non-target effects.
      Nowadays, plant-borne mosquitocides may serve as suitable alternative in the
      fight against mosquito vectors. In this study, the mosquito larvicidal activity
      of Origanum vulgare (Lamiaceae) leaf essential oil (EO) and its major chemical
      constituents was evaluated against the malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi and
      An. subpictus, the filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus and the Japanese
      encephalitis vector Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The chemical composition of the EO was
      analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the
      essential oil of O. vulgare contained 17 compounds. The major chemical components
      were carvacrol (38.30%) and terpinen-4-ol (28.70%). EO had a significant toxic
      effect against early third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, An. subpictus, Cx.
      quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, with LC50 values of 67.00, 74.14,
      80.35 and 84.93 mug/ml. The two major constituents extracted from the O. vulgare 
      EO were tested individually for acute toxicity against larvae of the four
      mosquito vectors. Carvacrol and terpinen-4-ol appeared to be most effective
      against An. stephensi (LC50=21.15 and 43.27 mug/ml, respectively) followed by An.
      subpictus (LC50=24.06 and 47.73 mug/ml), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50=26.08 and
      52.19 mug/ml) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50=27.95 and 54.87 mug/ml). Overall,
      this research adds knowledge to develop newer and safer natural larvicides
      against malaria, filariasis and Japanese encephalitis mosquito vectors.

AB  - Mosquitoes are the major vectors of pathogens and parasites including those
      causing malaria, the most deadly vector-borne disease. The negative environmental
      effects of most synthetic compounds combined with widespread development of
      insecticide resistance encourage an interest in finding and developing
      alternative products against mosquitoes. In this study,
      pyrimido[2,1-b]quinazoline derivative DHPM3 has been synthesized by three-step
      chemical reaction and screened for larvicide, adulticide, and repellent
      properties against Anopheles arabiensis, one of the dominant vectors of malaria
      in Africa. The title compound emerged as potential larvicide agent for further
      research and development, because it exerted 100% mortality, while adulticide
      activity was considered moderate.

AB  - Synthetic insecticides are generally employed to control the mosquito population.
      However, their injudicious over usage and non-biodegradability are associated
      with many adverse effects on the environment and mosquitoes. The application of
      environment-friendly mosquitocidals might be an alternate to overcome these
      issues. In this study, we found that organic or aqueous extracts of Agave
      angustifolia leaves exhibited a strong larvicidal activity (LD50 28.27 mug/ml)
      against Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Anopheles stephensi larvae
      within a short exposure of 12 h. The larvicidal activity of A. angustifolia is
      inherited and independent of the plants vegetative growth. Interestingly, the
      plant larvicidal activity was observed exclusively during the summer season
      (April-August, when outside temperature is between 30 and 50 degrees C) and it
      was significantly reduced during winter season (December-February, when the
      outside temperature falls to ~4 degrees C or lower). Thus, we hypothesized that
      the larvicidal components of A. angustifolia might be induced by the manipulation
      of environmental temperature and should be resistant to the hot conditions. We
      found that the larvicidal activity of A. angustifolia was induced when plants
      were maintained at 37 degrees C in a semi-natural environment against the
      controls that were growing outside in cold weather. Pre-incubation of A.
      angustifolia extract at 100 degrees C for 1 h killed 60% larvae in 12 h, which
      gradually increased to 100% mortality after 24 h. In addition, the dry powder
      formulation of A. angustifolia, also displayed a strong larvicidal activity after
      a long shelf life. Together, these findings revealed that A. angustifolia is an
      excellent source of temperature induced bioactive metabolites that may assist the
      preparedness for vector control programs competently.

TI  - Larvicidal and repellent potential of Zingiber nimmonii (J. Graham) Dalzell
      (Zingiberaceae) essential oil: an eco-friendly tool against malaria, dengue, and 
      lymphatic filariasis mosquito vectors?
PG  - 1807-16
LID - 10.1007/s00436-016-4920-x [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are important vectors of terms of public health
      relevance, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The continuous and
      indiscriminate use of conventional pesticides for the control of mosquito vectors
      has resulted in the development of resistance and negative impacts on non-target 
      organisms and the environment. Therefore, there is a need for development of
      effective mosquito control tools. In this study, the larvicidal and repellent
      activity of Zingiber nimmonii rhizome essential oil (EO) was evaluated against
      the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, and the 
      lymphatic filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The chemical composition of
      the EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). GC-MS
      revealed that the Z. nimmonii EO contained at least 33 compounds. Major
      constituents were myrcene, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, and alpha-cadinol.
      In acute toxicity assays, the EO showed significant toxicity against early
      third-stage larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with 
      LC50 values of 41.19, 44.46, and 48.26 mug/ml, respectively. Repellency bioassays
      at 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg/cm(2) of Z. nimmonii EO gave 100 % protection up to 120, 
      150, and 180 min. against An. stephensi, followed by Ae. aegypti (90, 120, and
      150 min) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (60, 90, and 120 min). Furthermore, the EO was 
      safer towards two non-target aquatic organisms, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia 
      affinis, with LC50 values of 3241.53 and 9250.12 mug/ml, respectively. Overall,
      this research adds basic knowledge to develop newer and safer natural larvicides 
      and repellent from Zingiberaceae plants against malaria, dengue, and filariasis
      mosquito vectors.

AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in India because climatic condition and 
      geography of India provide an ideal environment for development of malaria
      vector. Anopheles stephensi is a major urban malaria vector in India and its
      control has been hampered by insecticide resistance. In present study population 
      genetic structure of A. stephensi is analyzed at macro geographic level using 13 
      microsatellite markers. Significantly high genetic differentiation was found in
      all studied populations with differentiation values (FST) ranging from 0.0398 to 
      0.1808. The geographic distance was found to be playing a major role in genetic
      differentiation between different populations. Overall three genetic pools were
      observed and population of central India was found to be coexisting in two
      genetic pools. High effective population size (Ne) was found in all the studied
      populations.

TI  - Knockdown Resistance (kdr) Mutations in Indian Anopheles stephensi (Diptera:
      Culicidae) Populations.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects resulting from mutation(s) in the
      voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene is one of the mechanisms of resistance
      against DDT and the pyrethroid group of insecticides. Earlier, we reported the
      presence of two classic kdr mutations, i.e., L1014F and L1014S in Anopheles
      stephensi Liston, a major Indian malaria vector affecting mainly urban areas.
      This report presents the distribution of these alleles in different An. stephensi
      populations. Seven populations of An. stephensi from six states of India were
      screened for the presence of two alternative kdr mutations L1014F and L1014S
      using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We recorded the presence 
      of both kdr mutations in northern Indian populations (Alwar and Gurgaon), with
      the preponderance of L1014S, whereas only L1014F was present in Raipur (central
      India) and Chennai (southern India). None of the kdr mutations were found in
      Ranchi in eastern India and in Mangaluru and Mysuru in southern India. This study
      provides evidence for a focal pattern of distribution of kdr alleles in India.

TI  - UIS2: A Unique Phosphatase Required for the Development of Plasmodium Liver
      Stages.
PG  - e1005370
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005370 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium salivary sporozoites are the infectious form of the malaria parasite
      and are dormant inside salivary glands of Anopheles mosquitoes. During dormancy, 
      protein translation is inhibited by the kinase UIS1 that phosphorylates serine 59
      in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). De-phosphorylation of
      eIF2alpha-P is required for the transformation of sporozoites into the liver
      stage. In mammalian cells, the de-phosphorylation of eIF2alpha-P is mediated by
      the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Using a series of genetically knockout parasites
      we showed that in malaria sporozoites, contrary to mammalian cells, the
      eIF2alpha-P phosphatase is a member of the PP2C/PPM phosphatase family termed
      UIS2. We found that eIF2alpha was highly phosphorylated in uis2 conditional
      knockout sporozoites. These mutant sporozoites maintained the crescent shape
      after delivery into mammalian host and lost their infectivity. Both uis1 and uis2
      were highly transcribed in the salivary gland sporozoites but uis2 expression was
      inhibited by the Pumilio protein Puf2. The repression of uis2 expression was
      alleviated when sporozoites developed into liver stage. While most eukaryotic
      phosphatases interact transiently with their substrates, UIS2 stably bound to
      phosphorylated eIF2alpha, raising the possibility that high-throughput searches
      may identify chemicals that disrupt this interaction and prevent malaria
      infection.

TI  - Multipurpose effectiveness of Couroupita guianensis-synthesized gold
      nanoparticles: high antiplasmodial potential, field efficacy against malaria
      vectors and synergy with Aplocheilus lineatus predators.
PG  - 7543-58

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people
      worldwide. According to recent estimates, about 3.2 billion people, almost half
      of the world's population, are at risk of malaria. Malaria control is
      particularly challenging due to a growing number of chloroquine-resistant
      Plasmodium and pesticide-resistant Anopheles vectors. Newer and safer control
      tools are required. In this research, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were
      biosynthesized using a cheap flower extract of Couroupita guianensis as reducing 
      and stabilizing agent. The biofabrication of AuNP was confirmed by UV-vis
      spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray
      diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, and particle size analysis. AuNP showed
      different shapes including spheres, ovals, and triangles. AuNPs were crystalline 
      in nature with face-centered cubic geometry; mean size was 29.2-43.8 nm. In
      laboratory conditions, AuNPs were toxic against Anopheles stephensi larvae,
      pupae, and adults. LC50 was 17.36 ppm (larva I), 19.79 ppm (larva II), 21.69 ppm 
      (larva III), 24.57 ppm (larva IV), 28.78 ppm (pupa), and 11.23 ppm (adult). In
      the field, a single treatment with C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP (10 x
      LC50) led to complete larval mortality after 72 h. In standard laboratory
      conditions, the predation efficiency of golden wonder killifish, Aplocheilus
      lineatus, against A. stephensi IV instar larvae was 56.38 %, while in an aquatic 
      environment treated with sub-lethal doses of the flower extract or AuNP,
      predation efficiency was boosted to 83.98 and 98.04 %, respectively. Lastly, the 
      antiplasmodial activity of C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP was evaluated
      against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium
      falciparum. IC50 of C. guianensis flower extract was 43.21 mug/ml (CQ-s) and
      51.16 mug/ml (CQ-r). AuNP IC50 was 69.47 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 76.33 mug/ml (CQ-r).
      Overall, our results showed the multipurpose effectiveness of C.
      guianensis-synthesized AuNPs, since they may be proposed as newer and safer tools
      in the fight against CQ-r strains of P. falciparum and for field control of
      malaria vectors, in synergy with wonder killifish predators.

TI  - Potential mosquito repellent compounds of Ocimum species against 3N7H and 3Q8I of
      Anopheles gambiae.

AB  - Mosquitoes are exceptionally efficient in detecting their hosts for blood meal
      using odorant binding proteins, viz. 3N7H and 3Q8I and spread several dreadful
      diseases. DEET is a synthetic mosquito repellent widely used all over world for
      protection against mosquito bite. Reports reveal that, synthetic mosquito
      repellents may pose health problems in considerably large population. In view of 
      the above fact, we made an attempt to discover efficient and novel natural
      mosquito repellent compounds with least impact on human health. Methanolic leaf
      extracts of Ocimum basilicum Linn. var. pilosum (willd.)-Benth and Ocimum
      tenuiflorum var. CIM-AYU were subjected to GC-MS analysis and obtained 35
      phytochemical constituents. Repellent potentiality of the Ocimum compounds was
      assessed against 3Q8I and 3N7H of Anopheles gambiae. PDB structures of mosquito
      odorant binding proteins were downloaded, processed and docking studies were
      performed along with reference ligand DEET using Schrodinger MAESTRO 9.2
      software. Molecular docking results reveal that phenol,
      2-methoxy-3-(2-propenyl)-, licopersin, gamma sitosterol and benzene,
      1,2-dimethoxy-4-(2-propenyl)- from O. tenuiflorum var. CIM-AYU are strongly bound
      with 3N7H. Whereas, 4h-1-benzopyran-4-one,
      5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, catechol and monoacetin from O.
      basilicum Linn. var. pilosum (willd.)-Benth. show high binding affinity with
      odorant binding protein 3Q8I. All natural compounds tested in the present study
      display better docking scores than DEET. The results further substantiate that
      the 12 out of 35 compounds of the two Ocimum species found to be ideal candidates
      for design and development of potential mosquito repellents. ADME properties of
      the tested compounds further confirm that bioactive compounds of Ocimum species
      were found to be in acceptable range. Synchronized application of at least two
      different natural compounds (with best docking scores) which target 3N7H and 3Q8I
      (Odorant Binding Proteins of mosquito) proteins may provide enhanced protection
      against mosquitoes bite. Based on the ADME properties, natural compounds of
      Ocimum species can be considered for design and development of safe mosquito
      repellents.

TI  - The footprints of relapsing malaria in southwest Delhi, India.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Control of vivax malaria is challenging due to
      persistence of hypnozoites causing relapses and safety concerns with primaquine
      in G6PD deficient individuals. We present the epidemiology of malaria with
      emphasis on recurrence of vivax malaria over a period of four years in southwest 
      Delhi among patients reporting to malaria clinic. METHODS: Microscopic
      examination of stained blood smears of fever patients attending malaria clinic
      was performed. Confirmed malaria cases were treated as per the national treatment
      guidelines. The epidemiological data of confirmed malaria cases including
      demographic characteristics, age, gender and past history of malaria were
      analysed. Patients were asked to report in case of occurence of fever. RESULTS:
      From January 2011 to December 2014, 429 Plasmodium vivax, 24 P. falciparum and
      three mixed infection cases were reported to the Malaria Clinic at National
      Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi. Malaria cases peaked in the months of
      August and September during all the four years. Recurrent episodes of vivax
      malaria were observed in 14.72% patients to whom primaquine was not dispensed,
      while the prevalence was 4.02% among those who received primaquine. The relapsing
      patterns observed were of both short as well as long latency P. vivax phenotypes.
      The entomological survey of area from where malaria patients reported, showed
      prevalence of Anopheles stephensi. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study showed 
      presence of persistent P. vivax malaria with strains causing both frequent and
      long latency recurrences (probable relapses) in southwest Delhi. This highlights 
      the need to evaluate primaquine regimens against both these strains and formulate
      strategies to improve compliance to 14-days primaquine treatment.

AB  - Vector control is facing a threat due to the emergence of resistance to synthetic
      insecticides. Insecticides of plant origin my serve as an alternative biocontrol 
      technique in the future. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
      larvicidal activity of fractions and compounds from the whole-plant methanol
      extracts of Leucas aspera on the fourth-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
      stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The larvae were exposed to fractions with 
      concentrations ranging from 1.25, 2.25, 5, 10, and 20 ppm and isolated compounds.
      After 24 h exposure, larval mortality was assessed. Among the eight fractions,
      four from hexane extractions showed potent larvicidal activity against tested
      mosquito species at 20 ppm concentration. The isolated compound catechin showed
      pronounced larvicidal activity at very low concentrations. The LC50 and LC90
      values of catechin were 3.05 and 8.25 ppm against Ae. aegypti, 3.44 and 8.89 ppm 
      against An. stephensi, and 3.76 and 9.79 ppm against C. quinquefasciatus,
      respectively. The isolated compound was subjected to spectral analyses (GC-MS,
      FTIR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR) to elucidate the structure and to compare with
      spectral data literature.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) represent a key threat for millions of people
      worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating parasites and pathogens. In 
      this scenario, eco-friendly control tools against mosquito vectors are a
      priority. Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap, aqueous
      leaf extract of Anisomeles indica by reduction of Ag(+) ions from silver nitrate 
      solution has been investigated. Bio-reduced AgNP were characterized by UV-visible
      spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
      energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The
      acute toxicity of A. indica leaf extract and biosynthesized AgNP was evaluated
      against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the dengue vector Aedes
      albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Both the
      A. indica leaf extract and AgNP showed dose dependent larvicidal effect against
      all tested mosquito species. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract, biosynthesized
      AgNP showed higher toxicity against An. subpictus, Ae. albopictus, and Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus with LC50 values of 31.56, 35.21 and 38.08 mug/mL,
      respectively. Overall, this study firstly shed light on the mosquitocidal
      potential of A. indica, a potential bioresource for rapid, cheap and effective
      AgNP synthesis.

AB  - The present work reports the larvicidal potential of microbially synthesised
      silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using an actinobacterium, Streptomyces sp. M25
      isolated from Western Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India. The biomass of Streptomyces sp.
      was exposed to 1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. The synthesis of AgNPs was
      confirmed by visual inspection followed by instrumental analysis such as UV-vis
      spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
      energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force 
      microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron
      diffraction. Based on the TEM and XRD analysis, the average size of the AgNPs was
      determined to be 10-35 nm. The biosynthesised AgNPs exhibited significant
      larvicidal activity against malarial vector, Anopheles subpictus (LC50 51.34 mg/L
      and chi (2) value of 8.228), filarial vector, Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 48.98 
      mg/L and chi (2) value of 14.307) and dengue vector, Aedes aegypti (LC50 60.23
      mg/L and chi (2) value of 4.042), respectively. Similarly, AgNO3 had larvicidal
      activity against malarial vector, A. subpictus (LC50 42.544 mg/L and chi (2)
      value of 2.561), filarial vector, C. quinquefasciatus (LC50 44.922 mg/L and chi
      (2) value of 1.693) and dengue vector, A. aegypti (LC50 39.664 mg/L and chi (2)
      value of 5.724), respectively. The current study is a rapid, cost effective,
      eco-friendly and single step approach. The Streptomyces sp. M25 is a newly added 
      source for the synthesis of AgNPs with improved larvicidal activity.

AB  - The impact of green-synthesised mosquitocidal nanoparticles on non-target aquatic
      predators is poorly studied. In this research, we proposed a single-step method
      to synthesise silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) using the seed extract of Melia
      azedarach. Ag NP were characterised using a variety of biophysical methods,
      including UV-vis spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy,
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
      In laboratory assays on Anopheles stephensi, Ag NP showed LC50 ranging from 2.897
      (I instar larvae) to 14.548 ppm (pupae). In the field, the application of Ag NP
      (10 x LC50) lead to complete elimination of larval populations after 72 h. The
      application of Ag NP in the aquatic environment did not show negative adverse
      effects on predatory efficiency of the mosquito natural enemy Cyclops vernalis.
      Overall, this study highlights the concrete possibility to employ M.
      azedarach-synthesised Ag NP on young instars of malaria vectors.

TI  - Application of biogenic carbon dioxide produced by yeast with different carbon
      sources for attraction of mosquitoes towards adult mosquito traps.

AB  - Surveillance is a prime requisite for controlling arthropod vectors like
      mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Carbon
      dioxide (CO2) is one of the main cues from vertebrate breath that attracts
      mosquitoes towards the host. Hence, CO2 is used as an attractant during
      surveillance of mosquitoes either from commercial cylinders or dry ice for
      mosquito traps. In the present study, the biogenic carbon dioxide production was 
      optimized with different carbon sources such as glucose, simple sugar and jaggery
      with and without yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) media using commercial baker's
      yeast. The results showed that yeast produced more biogenic CO2 with simple sugar
      as compared to other carbon sources. Further substrate concentration was
      optimized for the continuous production of biogenic CO2 for a minimum of 12 h by 
      using 10 g of baker's yeast with 50 g of simple sugar added to 1.5 l distilled
      water (without YPD media) in a 2-l plastic bottle. This setup was applied in
      field condition along with two different mosquito traps namely Mosquito Killing
      System (MKS) and Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap. Biogenic CO2 from this setup has
      increased the trapping efficiency of MKS by 6.48-fold for Culex quinquefasciatus,
      2.62-fold for Aedes albopictus and 1.5-fold for Anopheles stephensi. In the case 
      of BGS, the efficiency was found to be increased by 3.54-fold for Ae. albopictus,
      4.33-fold for An. stephensi and 1.3-fold for Armigeres subalbatus mosquitoes. On 
      the whole, plastic bottle setup releasing biogenic CO2 from sugar and yeast has
      increased the efficiency of MKS traps by 6.38-fold and 2.74-fold for BGS traps as
      compared to traps without biogenic CO2. The present study reveals that, among
      different carbon sources used, simple sugar as a substance (which is economical
      and readily available across the world) yielded maximum biogenic CO2 with yeast. 
      This setup can be used as an alternative to CO2 cylinder and dry ice in any adult
      mosquito traps to enhance their trapping efficiency of a mosquito surveillance
      programme.

TI  - [The mosquito name of Anopheles ramsayi in China should be corrected to Anopheles
      pseudojamesi Strickland and Chowdhury, 1927 (Diptera : Culicidae)].
PG  - 288-9
AB  - The present review deals with the nominate priority of mosquito names between An.
      ramsayi Covell, 1927 (published in Ind J Med Res, April 1927 number) and An.
      pseudojamesi Strickland and Chowdhury, 1927 (published in Ind Med Gaz, May 1927
      number) and its synonymy reported in India. They adopted the priority by order of
      monthly number of the periodicals without exact dates. The name ranisayi for the 
      priority used as the valid name long time in literature, and forms a wrong
      nominate case. The editor of Ind. Med. Gaz.(1936) entered an interesting footnote
      regarding the exact dates of publication for two names: ramsayi issued in May
      15th 1927, while pseudojamesi was May 10th 1927. The fact showed that the name
      pseudojamesi has its priority. Nurul Huda and Harrison (1985) informed clearly
      for wrong nominate case, and clarified that the name pseudojamesi has priority
      over ramsayi. Therefore An. pseudojamesi is elevated to species rank (corrected
      to valid name), whereas An. ramsayi is regarded as its junior synonym (invalid
      name). That the rejected name of An. ramsayi now still being used in Chinese
      lliterature should he corrected to An. pseudojamesi quickly.

TI  - Fern-synthesized nanoparticles in the fight against malaria: LC/MS analysis of
      Pteridium aquilinum leaf extract and biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles with
      high mosquitocidal and antiplasmodial activity.
PG  - 997-1013
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4828-x [doi]
AB  - Malaria remains a major public health problem due to the emergence and spread of 
      Plasmodium falciparum strains resistant to chloroquine. There is an urgent need
      to investigate new and effective sources of antimalarial drugs. This research
      proposed a novel method of fern-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP)
      using a cheap plant extract of Pteridium aquilinum, acting as a reducing and
      capping agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, Fourier
      transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
      (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Phytochemical analysis of P. aquilinum leaf
      extract revealed the presence of phenols, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids,
      proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, glycosides, steroids, and triterpenoids. LC/MS
      analysis identified at least 19 compounds, namely pterosin, hydroquinone,
      hydroxy-acetophenone, hydroxy-cinnamic acid, 5, 7-dihydroxy-4-methyl coumarin,
      trans-cinnamic acid, apiole, quercetin 3-glucoside, hydroxy-L-proline,
      hypaphorine, khellol glucoside, umbelliferose, violaxanthin, ergotamine tartrate,
      palmatine chloride, deacylgymnemic acid, methyl laurate, and palmitoyl acetate.
      In DPPH scavenging assays, the IC50 value of the P. aquilinum leaf extract was
      10.04 mug/ml, while IC50 of BHT and rutin were 7.93 and 6.35 mug/ml. In
      mosquitocidal assays, LC50 of P. aquilinum leaf extract against Anopheles
      stephensi larvae and pupae were 220.44 ppm (larva I), 254.12 ppm (II), 302.32 ppm
      (III), 395.12 ppm (IV), and 502.20 ppm (pupa). LC50 of P. aquilinum-synthesized
      AgNP were 7.48 ppm (I), 10.68 ppm (II), 13.77 ppm (III), 18.45 ppm (IV), and
      31.51 ppm (pupa). In the field, the application of P. aquilinum extract and AgNP 
      (10 x LC50) led to 100 % larval reduction after 72 h. Both the P. aquilinum
      extract and AgNP reduced longevity and fecundity of An. stephensi adults. Smoke
      toxicity experiments conducted against An. stephensi adults showed that P.
      aquilinum leaf-, stem-, and root-based coils evoked mortality rates comparable to
      the permethrin-based positive control (57, 50, 41, and 49 %, respectively).
      Furthermore, the antiplasmodial activity of P. aquilinum leaf extract and
      green-synthesized AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive
      (CQ-s) strains of P. falciparum. IC50 of P. aquilinum were 62.04 mug/ml (CQ-s)
      and 71.16 mug/ml (CQ-r); P. aquilinum-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50 of 78.12
      mug/ml (CQ-s) and 88.34 mug/ml (CQ-r). Overall, our results highlighted that
      fern-synthesized AgNP could be candidated as a new tool against
      chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum and different developmental instars of its
      primary vector An. stephensi. Further research on nanosynthesis routed by the
      LC/MS-identified constituents is ongoing.

TI  - Biochemical basis of alphamethrin resistance in different life stages of
      Anopheles stephensi strains of Bangalore, India.
PG  - 1689-701
LID - 10.1002/ps.4194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles stephensi is an important urban malaria vector in the
      Indian subcontinent. Extensive application of insecticides evokes microevolution,
      which results in resistance that can be traced back to their genotypes. In this
      study, resistant and susceptible strains of An. stephensi for alphamethrin were
      selected by selective inbreeding for 27 and ten generations respectively. The
      biochemical basis of resistance in all the life stages was investigated.
      Quantitative assays were performed for proteins (total and soluble), esterases
      (alpha, beta and acetylcholine) and phosphatases (acid and alkaline) by
      spectrophotometry, and qualitative assays for the enzymes by native
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The enzyme quantities significantly 
      varied in all life stages of the resistant strain as compared with the
      susceptible ones. Qualitative studies showed seven isoforms for alpha- and
      beta-esterases, three each for acetylcholinesterase and alkaline phosphatase and 
      two for acid phosphatase. Exclusive bands were found in the resistant strain,
      such as alpha-Est 1 and beta-Est 1 in eggs and larvae, beta-Est 3 in adult males,
      beta-Est 2 in adult females and AlkP 1, AlkP 2 and AlkP 3 in adult females,
      larvae and adult males respectively. CONCLUSION: Variations in the quantity and
      specific enzyme isoforms play a key role in the development of alphamethrin
      resistance in An. stephensi. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Facile biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Barleria cristata:
      mosquitocidal potential and biotoxicity on three non-target aquatic organisms.
PG  - 925-35
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4817-0 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) act as vectors of important pathogens and
      parasites, such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis and
      lymphatic filariasis. The use of synthetic mosquitocides often leads to high
      operational costs and adverse non-target effects. Recently, plant-borne compounds
      have been proposed for rapid extracellular biosynthesis of mosquitocidal
      nanoparticles. However, the impact of these nanomosquitocides against biological 
      control agents of mosquito larval populations has been poorly studied. In this
      research, we biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) using the Barleria
      cristata leaf extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The biosynthesis of Ag
      NP was confirmed analyzing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance using
      ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry. Scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the clustered and
      irregular shapes of Ag NP. The presence of silver was confirmed by
      energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
      spectroscopy investigated the identity of secondary metabolites, which may also
      act as Ag NP capping agents. The acute toxicity of B. cristata leaf extract and
      biosynthesized Ag NP was evaluated against larvae of Anopheles subpictus, Aedes
      albopictus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract,
      biosynthesized Ag NP showed higher toxicity against An. subpictus, Ae.
      albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus with lethal concentration (LC)50 values of 
      12.46, 13.49, and 15.01 mug/mL, respectively. Notably, biosynthesized Ag NP were 
      found safer to non-target organisms Diplonychus indicus, Anisops bouvieri, and
      Gambusia affinis, with respective LC50 values ranging from 633.26 to 866.92
      mug/mL. Overall, our results highlight that B. cristata-fabricated Ag NP are a
      promising and eco-friendly tool against young instar populations of mosquito
      vectors of medical and veterinary importance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum is transmitted from person to person by
      Anopheles mosquitoes after completing its sexual reproductive cycle within the
      infected mosquito. An efficacious vaccine holds the potential to interrupt
      development of the parasite in the mosquito leading to control and possibly

      falciparum glutamate-rich protein (R0) fused in frame to a correctly folded
      fragment of Pfs48/45 (10C). Here, a series of novel adjuvants were screened for
      their ability to elicit transmission-blocking (TB) antibodies. METHODS: The
      recombinant fusion protein R0.10C was produced in Lactococcus lactis and purified
      by affinity-chromatography on a monoclonal antibody (mAb 85RF45.1) against a
      major epitope for TB antibodies (epitope 1) harboured on R0.10C. Immune-purified 
      R0.10C was mixed with a series of adjuvants and tested in mice and rats. RESULTS:
      In general, all R0.10C formulations elicited high levels of antibodies
      recognizing native Pfs48/45 in macrogametes/zygotes. TB activity of anti-R0.10C
      antisera was assessed in the standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). Potency of
      different adjuvant/R0.10C combinations was tested in mice and rats using
      aluminium hydroxide (Alum), Alum with micellar and emulsion formulations of a
      synthetic TLR4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA), stable emulsion
      (SE)/GLA, AbISCO-100 and Freund's adjuvant (as reference). All formulations
      produced high antibody titres recognizing the native Pfs48/45 protein in
      macrogametes/zygotes. Interestingly, the GLA-Alum combination adjuvant was the
      most potent inducer of TB antibodies based on serum collected after two
      immunizations. In agreement with previous observations, biological activity in
      the SMFA correlated well with the level of anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies. CONCLUSION: 
      The combined data provide a strong basis for entering the next phase of clinical 
      grade R0.10C production and testing.

TI  - Asparagine requirement in Plasmodium berghei as a target to prevent malaria
      transmission and liver infections.
PG  - 8775
LID - 10.1038/ncomms9775 [doi]
AB  - The proteins of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, are strikingly rich in
      asparagine. Plasmodium depends primarily on host haemoglobin degradation for
      amino acids and has a rudimentary pathway for amino acid biosynthesis, but
      retains a gene encoding asparagine synthetase (AS). Here we show that deletion of
      AS in Plasmodium berghei (Pb) delays the asexual- and liver-stage development
      with substantial reduction in the formation of ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites
      in mosquitoes. In the absence of asparagine synthesis, extracellular asparagine
      supports suboptimal survival of PbAS knockout (KO) parasites. Depletion of blood 
      asparagine levels by treating PbASKO-infected mice with asparaginase completely
      prevents the development of liver stages, exflagellation of male gametocytes and 
      the subsequent formation of sexual stages. In vivo supplementation of asparagine 
      in mice restores the exflagellation of PbASKO parasites. Thus, the parasite life 
      cycle has an absolute requirement for asparagine, which we propose could be
      targeted to prevent malaria transmission and liver infections.

TI  - Eugenol, alpha-pinene and beta-caryophyllene from Plectranthus barbatus essential
      oil as eco-friendly larvicides against malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis 
      mosquito vectors.
PG  - 807-15
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4809-0 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people
      worldwide. Eco-friendly mosquitocides are a priority. In Ayurvedic medicine,
      Plectranthus species have been used to treat heart disease, convulsions,
      spasmodic pain and painful urination. In this research, we evaluated the acute
      toxicity of essential oil from Plectranthus barbatus and its major constituents, 
      against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the dengue vector Aedes
      albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The
      chemical composition of P. barbatus essential oil was analyzed by gas
      chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Nineteen components were identified. Major
      constituents were eugenol (31.12%), alpha-pinene (19.38%) and beta-caryophyllene 
      (18.42%). Acute toxicity against early third-instar larvae of An. subpictus, Ae. 
      albopictus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was investigated. The essential oil had a
      significant toxic effect against larvae of An. subpictus, Ae. albopictus and Cx. 
      tritaeniorhynchus, with 50% lethal concentration (LC50) values of 84.20, 87.25
      and 94.34 mug/ml and 90% lethal concentration (LC90) values of 165.25, 170.56 and
      179.58 mug/ml, respectively. Concerning major constituents, eugenol, alpha-pinene
      and beta-caryophyllene appeared to be most effective against An. subpictus (LC50 
      = 25.45, 32.09 and 41.66 mug/ml, respectively), followed by Ae. albopictus (LC50 
      = 28.14, 34.09 and 44.77 mug/ml, respectively) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 = 
      30.80, 36.75 and 48.17 mug/ml, respectively). Overall, the chance to use
      metabolites from P. barbatus essential oil against mosquito vectors seems
      promising, since they are effective at low doses and could be an advantageous
      alternative to build newer and safer mosquito control tools.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF PUPAL PRODUCTIVITY OF AEDES AND CO-OCCURRING MOSQUITOES IN KOLKATA,
      INDIA.
PG  - 1279-91
AB  - Monitoring of dengue vectors provide baseline information about the abundance and
      subsequent management strategy. An appraisal of mosquito abundance using dengue
      vectors as focal species was made in respect to Kolkata, India as geographical
      area. The data on immature abundance in the container larval habitats viz,
      earthen, porcelain and plastic materials were subjected to three-way factorial
      ANOVA, using months, habitats and species as variables. Similar tests were done
      on pupal weight and wing length. It was observed that Anopheles subpictus, Culex 
      quinquefasciatus coexist with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in different
      container habitats, that varied with months and habitats. Ae. aegypti and Ae.
      albopictus were found in higher proportions in porcelain and plastic containers. 
      In earthen containers a stable ratio of three mosquitoes was observed. Sex
      specific variations in pupal weight and wing length were noted in both species of
      Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The wing length of adult Aedes mosquitoes showed 
      correspondence with pupal weight suggesting the use of pupal weight can be used
      as indicator of prospective adult body size. Although less known as container
      breeding, presence of An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefascistus along with Aedes
      indicates that availability of waste containers in environment increases risks of
      dengue and other mosquito borne diseases. The present habitat-based study calls
      for a strict vector management strategy to reduce the sources of ovipostion in
      various container habitats to minimize the mosquito vectors and thus potential
      risk of dengue and other mosquito borne diseases.

TI  - A shift in resting habitat and feeding behavior of Anopheles fluviatilis sibling 
      species in the Keonjhar district of Odisha, India.
PG  - 730-7
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trv081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles fluviatilis exists as a complex of sibling species S, T, U 
      and V exhibiting distinct variations. Sibling species S is considered as the main
      vector and anthropogenic whereas T, U and V are zoophagic non-vectors. This study
      was performed in a forested village of Keonjhar district, Odisha to identify the 
      status of An. fluviatilis sibling species. METHODS: Mosquito collections were
      made from cattle sheds (CS), human dwellings (HD) and mixed dwellings (MD) from
      June 2012 to May 2013. The proportion of An. fluviatilis collected from different
      habitats was compared with An. culicifacies. PCR assays were conducted to reveal 
      their sibling species composition, host preference and sporozoite rate. RESULTS: 
      Anopheles fluviatilis was the dominant species followed by An. culicifacies. The 
      relative proportion of collection was high in MD and HD for An. fluviatilis and
      An. culicifacies respectively. PCR assay confirmed 9.4% S and 75.5% T. Mean
      collection of sibling species T and S were significantly high in MD and HD. Human
      blood index (HBI) of 0.88 and 0.61 was confirmed for sibling species S and T
      respectively with 13% sporozoite rate for S. CONCLUSIONS: High density of the
      sibling T was found in the study site with a shift in resting habitat and blood
      feeding preference. GenBank submissions: KJ451071.1, KJ451072.1, KJ451073.1,

AB  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Hybanthus enneaspermus
      extract at room temperature that act as a reducing agent as well as capping agent
      has been investigated. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible
      spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), zeta
      potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The silver surface plasmon resonance was
      observed at 420 nm in the UV-visible spectrum. XRD peaks were observed at 2theta 
      values in 38.20 degrees , 44.40 degrees , 64.60 degrees , and 77.50 degrees which
      are indexed as (111), (200), (220), and (311) bands of face-centered cubic (fcc) 
      structures of silver. FTIR revealed the AgNPs were capped with plant compounds of
      alcohol, phenols, carbonyl, amines, and amide functional groups. TEM image shows 
      that the particles were of spherical, hexagonal, and triangular in shape, and the
      size range was 16-26 nm. Further, DLS exhibits the average size of 25.2 nm and
      the zeta values were measured (-27.1 mV) which proves the stability of the AgNPs.
      The conversion of Ag(+) ions into Ag(0) was calculated using inductively coupled 
      plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and was found to be 96 %. The
      biosynthesized AgNPs showed the larvicidal activity with the LC50 values of 17.24
      and 13.12 mg/L against the fourth-instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus and Culex 
      quinquefasciatus, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of the plant extract showed
      that 39 bioactive phytochemical compounds have been found to possess a wide range
      of activities, which may help in the protection against incurable diseases.

AB  - The spatial and temporal dynamics of mosquitoes in stream pools were examined in 
      a biosphere reserve of the Southern Western Ghats, India. The immature mosquitoes
      in stream pools were collected from stream substrates of bedrock pool, boulder
      cavity and sand puddle. The collected larvae and pupae were reared and
      identified. In total, 16 species from four genera of mosquitoes were collected.
      The mosquito species from Culex and Anopheles were predominantly occurred. The
      bedrock pool had the highest diversity and abundance of mosquitoes. The
      statistical analyses showed that the substrate specificity and the seasons were
      positively related to the distribution of mosquitoes rather than spatial pattern.
      This study described the spatial and temporal pattern of mosquitoes in stream
      pools of the Southern Western Ghats. This information would be helpful to
      National Vector borne disease control program for surveillance and control.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence and blood meal analysis of filarial vector Culex
      quinquefasciatus in coastal areas of Digha, West Bengal, India.
PG  - 252-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Filariasis is one of the major vector-borne diseases
      causing serious health problem in the tropics and subtropics. The coastal areas
      of Digha are known to be a filariasis prone region of West Bengal, India. The
      filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti is transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus, 
      the established filarial vector in West Bengal, India. The present work was aimed
      to determine the abundance of different mosquito species; and the frequency,
      distribution and blood meal analysis of Cx. quinquefasciatus in coastal areas of 
      Digha. METHODS: During the present study, a total of 11,537 mosquitoes [Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Armigeres subalbatus, Anopheles barbirostris, An. annularis,
      An. subpictus, An. sundaicus, Aedes albopictus, and Cx. vishnui (group)] were
      collected by hand collection method from human habitations and cattlesheds of 10 
      villages of Digha, West Bengal, India. The seasonal prevalence of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus was studied. In each season, blood meals of 300 Cx.
      quinquefasciatus collected from human habitations were analysed during the study 
      period. RESULTS: Cx. quinquefasciatus was found to be the dominant species
      (88.44% of the total collection) in the study area. It was most frequently found 
      in and around human habitations than cattlesheds. Total man hour density
      calculation revealed that this species was most prevalent during the rainy
      season. Two-way ANOVA revealed that the abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus varied 
      with different seasons. Blood meal analysis showed that the filarial vector
      preferred human blood than that of other animals. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:
      This study suggested Cx. quinquefasciatus as the dominant mosquito species in the
      study area; and the anthropophilic nature of Cx. quinquefasciatus might be the
      reason of increase in the intensity of filarial transmission in coastal areas of 
      Digha.

TI  - Anopheline mosquitoes in District Ramgarh (Jharkhand), India.
PG  - 232-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Jharkhand is one of the highly malaria endemic states in
      India and experiencing vast ecological and human-induced changes over the years. 
      These changes have provided more favourable conditions for malaria transmission
      in the region. The present study was carried out to find out the distribution and
      prevalence of anopheline vector and non-vector species in District Ramgarh of
      Jharkhand state. METHODS: Daytime indoor resting adult female anopheline
      mosquitoes were collected from four subcentres comprising of eight study villages
      in District Ramgarh. The collections were made from fixed as well as random human
      dwellings and cattlesheds on fortnightly basis using manual aspiration method
      from January to December 2012. Mosquito identification was done by using standard
      identification keys. RESULTS: A total of 18,875 anophelines belonging to 19
      species were collected. Of these, 61.87% were vector species (An. culicifacies,
      An. fluviatilis and An. annularis). Of total vector collection, 57.44% was
      observed in Gola block and 42.55% in Ramgarh. An. culicifacies was predominant
      species followed by An. fluviatilis and An. annularis in the study area. Out of
      19, eight anopheline species exhibited successional changes in their composition 
      over the period of years. Statistical analysis revealed positive correlation
      between meteorological variables and man hour density in case of An.
      culicifacies, whereas these were negatively correlated in case of An. fluviatilis
      and An. annularis. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study revealed the prevalence
      of three recognised malaria vector species (An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and
      An. annularis) in high density throughout the year in this area, which indicates 
      possibility of widening of malaria transmission window in the presence of malaria
      parasites. The shifting of anopheline species in Ramgarh also indicate alteration
      in ecological, environmental and sociological conditions, which necessitate
      routine monitoring on ecology and successional changes of vector species as well 
      as malariological survey for management and adoption of appropriate vector
      control strategies in this area.

AB  - Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people
      and animals through the bites of infected mosquitoes. We biosynthesized silver
      nanoparticles (AgNP) using Aristolochia indica extract as reducing and
      stabilizing agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, EDX
      and XRD. In laboratory, LC50 of A. indica extract against Anopheles stephensi
      ranged from 262.66 (larvae I) to 565.02 ppm (pupae). LC50 of AgNP against A.
      stephensi ranged from 3.94 (larvae I) to 15.65 ppm (pupae). In the field, the
      application of A. indica extract and AgNP (10 x LC50) leads to 100% larval
      reduction after 72 h. In laboratory, 24-h predation efficiency of Diplonychus
      indicus against A. stephensi larvae was 33% (larvae II) and 57% (larvae III). In 
      AgNP-contaminated environment (1 ppm), it was 45.5% (larvae II) and 71.75%
      (larvae III). Overall, A. indica-synthesized AgNP may be considered as newer and 
      safer control tools against Anopheles vectors.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit various diseases which mainly affect the human beings and
      every year cause millions of deaths globally. Currently available chemical and
      synthetic mosquitocidal agents pose severe side effects, pollute the environment 
      vigorously, and become resistance. There is an urgent need to identify and
      develop the cost effective, compatible and eco-friendly product for mosquito
      control. The present study was aimed to find out the larvicidal potential of
      aqueous crude extract and green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from
      Annona muricata leaves were tested against fourth instar larvae of three
      important mosquitoes i.e. Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes 
      aegypti using different concentrations of AgNPs (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ppm) and
      the aqueous leaf extract (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ppm) for 24 and 48 h. The
      maximum mortality was noticed in AgNPs than aqueous leaf extract of A. muricata
      against tested mosquitoes with least LC50 values of 37.70, 31.29, and 20.65 ppm
      (24h) and 546.7, 516.2, and 618.4 ppm (48 h), respectively. All tested
      concentrations of AgNps exhibited 100% mortality in A. aegypti larvae at 48 hour 
      observation. In addition, the plant mediated AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis
      spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, particle size analyser, X-ray 
      diffraction, high resonance transmission electron microscopy, and
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis for confirmation of nanoparticle
      synthesis. Based on the findings of the study suggests that the use of A.
      muricata plant mediated AgNPs can act as an alternate insecticidal agents for
      controlling target mosquitoes.

AB  - Binary toxin (Bin) produced by Lysinibacillus sphaericus is toxic to Culex and
      Anopheles mosquito larvae. It has been used world-wide for control of mosquitoes 
      that vector disease. The Bin toxin interacts with the glucosidase receptor, Cpm1,
      in Culex and its orthologue, Agm3, in Anopheles mosquitoes. However, the exact
      mechanism of its mode of action is not clearly understood. It is essential to
      understand mode of action of Bin toxin to circumvent the resistance that develops
      over generations of exposure. A suitable model cell line will facilitate
      investigations of the molecular action of Bin toxin. Here we report Bin toxin
      activity on Ag55 cell line that has been derived from an actual target, Anopheles
      gambiae larvae. The Bin toxin, both in pro and active forms, kills the Ag55 cells
      within 24h. Bin toxin internalizes in Ag55 cells and also induces vacuolation as 
      tracked by Lysotracker dye. The dose response studies showed that 1.5nM of Bin
      toxin is sufficient to induce vacuolation and Ag55 cell death. Presence of
      alpha-glucosidase gene (Agm3) expression in the Ag55 cells was also confirmed.
      Thus, Ag55 cells constitute an appropriate model system to decipher the mode of
      Bin action in mosquito larvae.

AB  - Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes are able to transmit both falciparum and vivax 
      malaria in India. More than 65% of malaria cases reported annually spread through
      this vector. Despite the fact that it poses major vectorial burden in India, the 
      molecular basis of its immune role against Plasmodium development has not been
      explored intensively. Here, we characterized An. culicifacies SOCS (suppressor of
      cytokine signaling) gene, a regulator of STAT pathway and its expression analysis
      upon Plasmodium infection. Our analysis has demonstrated that An. culicifacies
      SOCS gene shares strikingly high level of sequence similarity in SH2 domain and
      SOCS box region with other mosquito species. However, its N-terminal identity is 
      limited to Anophelines mosquito only, suggesting its genus specific role. SOCS
      mRNA is expressed in all developmental stages of mosquito and its expression is
      higher in male than female adults. SOCS mRNA is significantly induced after
      Plasmodium infection in midgut tissue indicating its involvement in the immune
      defense responses. This is the first evidence of involvement of SOCS as an immune
      gene in Indian malaria vector An. culicifacies.

TI  - Absence of asymptomatic malaria in a cohort of 133 individuals in a malaria
      endemic area of Assam, India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in northeast India affects children and adults annually. The 
      number of malaria cases reported has declined over the past few years.
      Nevertheless, it is not clear whether there is an actual decline in parasitaemia 
      or whether asymptomatic malaria infections are on the rise, especially in
      forested and forest-fringed areas. Asymptomatic malaria forms a parasite
      reservoir that acts as an epicentre for malaria spread during high-transmission
      season. Therefore it is important to understand the quantum of asymptomatic
      malaria infections among the vulnerable population. METHOD: Four forest fringed
      historically malaria endemic villages were selected for the study. A total of 133
      individuals without a fever history in the past four weeks were tested for
      malaria parasite using rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) assay during January - February 2014. Indoor resting
      Anopheles vectors were collected, identified and tested for sporozoite using
      VectorTest panel assay during October 2013 to March 2014, which is a low
      transmission season for malaria. Social and demographic data were recorded during
      the study. RESULTS: Mean age (+/- SEM) of the participants was 16.1 +/- 1.2 years
      (95 % CI: 13.8-18.4). All participants (100 %) reported to use mosquito nets.
      Altogether, 43.6 % of participants had education below primary level and only 9 %
      reported a travel history during the past four weeks. All RDT, microscopy and PCR
      assays were found negative indicating no asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia. Seven
      known malaria vector species namely, Anopheles nivipes, An. minimus, An.
      annularis, An. vagus, An. aconitus, An. philippinensis and An. culicifacies, were
      recorded in the present study. VectorTest sporozoite panel assay conducted on 45 
      pools (N = 224) of vector mosquitoes were found negative for Plasmodium
      sporozoite. DISCUSSION: Northeastern states of India report asymptomatic malaria 
      parasitemia along with high malaria transmission. An. minimus and An. dirus are
      recognised as efficient vectors, but An. culicifacies, An. philippinensis and An.
      annularis also play role in malaria transmission. Currently all participants were
      found negative for asymptomatic malaria, however the small sample size may
      restrict the scope of present results to the population living in more remote
      areas. CONCLUSION: No cases of asymptomatic malaria infections parasitaemia was
      found in the present study conducted during a low transmission season indicating 
      that asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia may not be prevalent in the region.
      Mosquito specimens were tested negative for the malaria sporozoites. Study
      findings encourage the ongoing malaria intervention efforts and recommends
      similar investigations in different ecological areas involving large populations.

AB  - Malaria causes extensive morbidity and mortality in humans and results in
      significant economic losses in India. The distribution of immature
      malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes was studied in 17 villages in
      Coimbatore District as a prelude to the development and implementation of vector 
      control strategies that are intended to reduce the risk of human exposure to
      potentially infectious mosquitoes. Eight Anopheles species were recorded. The
      most numerous species were Anopheles vagus, Anopheles subpictus, and Anopheles
      hyrcanus. The location of mosquito development sites and the density of larvae in
      each village was evaluated for correlation with selected demographic, biologic,
      and land use parameters using remote sensing and geographic information systems
      (GIS) technology. We found the number of mosquito development sites in a village 
      and the density of larvae in such sites to be positively correlated with human
      population density but not the surface area (km(2)) of the village. The number of
      mosquito development sites and the density of larvae in each site were not
      correlated. Data from this study are being used to construct a GIS-based mapping 
      system that will enable the location of aquatic habitats with Anopheles larvae in
      the Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu, India as target sites for the application of
      vector control.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a key threat for millions of people
      worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating pathogens and parasites. The
      standard method of utilisation of morphological characters becomes challenging
      due to various factors such as phenotypical variations. We explored the
      complementary approach of CO1 gene-based identification, analysing ten species of
      mosquito vectors belonging to three genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles from
      India. Analysed nucleotide sequences were found without pseudo genes and indels; 
      they match with high similarity in nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
      (BLASTn) search. The partial CO1 sequence of Anopheles niligricus was the first
      time record submitted to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
      Mean intra- and interspecies divergence was found to be 1.30 and 3.83 %,
      respectively. The congeneric divergence was three times higher than the
      conspecifics. Deep intraspecific divergence was noted in three of the species,
      and the reason could be explained more accurately in the future by improving the 
      sample size across different locations. The transitional and transversional
      substitutions were tested individually. Ts and Tv substitutions in all the 1st,
      2nd and 3rd codons were estimated to be (0.44, 99.51), (40.35, 59.66) and (59.16,
      40.84), respectively. Saturation of the sequences was resolved, since both the Ts
      and Tv exhibited a linear relationship suggesting that the sequences were not
      saturated. NJ and ML tree analysis showed that the individuals of the same
      species clustered together based on the CO1 sequence similarity, regardless of
      their collection site and geographic location. Overall, this study adds basic
      knowledge to molecular evolution of mosquito vectors of medical and veterinary
      importance and may be useful to improve biotechnological tools employed in
      Culicidae control programmes.

TI  - Mosquitocidal properties of Bacillus species isolated from mangroves of Vellar
      estuary, Southeast coast of India.

AB  - Samples collected from the mangroves of Vellar estuary yielded a mosquitocidal
      bacterium, whose secondary metabolites exhibited mosquito larvicidal and
      pupicidal activity. The bacterium was isolated using standard microbiological
      methods and identified using classical biochemical tests. The mosquitocidal
      bacterium was identified as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus
      sphaericus and Bacillus cereus. Mosquitocidal metabolite(s) was separated from
      the culture supernatant of the bacterium and its efficacy was against the larval 
      and pupal stages of two different species of mosquitoes and determined in terms
      of LC50 and LC90. Mosquito larvicidal activity in terms of LC50 against
      Anopheleus stephensi and Aedes aegypti was 4.374 and 7.406 mul/ml and its
      pupicidal activity was 4.928 and 9.865 mul/ml, respectively. The present study
      proved that the mosquitocidal properties of the Bacillus species isolated from
      mangroves of Vellar estuary was evaluated as target species of mosquito vectors. 
      This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the vector control programs.

TI  - Datura metel-synthesized silver nanoparticles magnify predation of dragonfly
      nymphs against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 4645-54
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4710-x [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people
      and animals through the bites of infected mosquitoes. The employ of synthetic
      insecticides to control Anopheles populations leads to high operational costs,
      non-target effects, and induced resistance. Recently, plant-borne compounds have 
      been proposed for efficient and rapid extracellular synthesis of mosquitocidal
      nanoparticles. However, their impact against predators of mosquito larvae has
      been poorly studied. In this study, we synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
      using the Datura metel leaf extract as reducing and stabilizing agent. The
      biosynthesis of AgNPs was confirmed analyzing the excitation of surface plasmon
      resonance using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) showed the clustered and irregular shapes of AgNPs, with a mean 
      size of 40-60 nm. The presence of silver was determined by energy-dispersive
      X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis
      investigated the identity of secondary metabolites, which may be acting as AgNP
      capping agents. In laboratory, LC50 of D. metel extract against Anopheles
      stephensi ranged from 34.693 ppm (I instar larvae) to 81.500 ppm (pupae). LC50 of
      AgNP ranged from 2.969 ppm (I instar larvae) to 6.755 ppm (pupae). Under standard
      laboratory conditions, the predation efficiency of Anax immaculifrons nymphs
      after 24 h was 75.5 % (II instar larvae) and 53.5 % (III instar larvae). In
      AgNP-contaminated environment, predation rates were boosted to 95.5 and 78 %,
      respectively. Our results documented that D. metel-synthesized AgNP might be
      employed at rather low doses to reduce larval populations of malaria vectors,
      without detrimental effects on behavioral traits of young instars of the
      dragonfly Anax immaculifrons.

AB  - Leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution at residue L1014 in the voltage-gated
      sodium channel, target site of action for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
      and pyrethroids, is the most common knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation reported 
      in several insects conferring resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Here, we
      report presence of two coexisting alternative transversions, A>T and A>C, on the 
      third codon position of L1014 residue in malaria vector Anopheles subpictus
      Grassi (species A) from Jamshedpur (India), both leading to the same amino acid
      substitution of Leu-to-Phe with allelic frequencies of 19 and 67%, respectively. 
      A single primer-introduced restriction analysis-polymerase chain reaction
      (PIRA-PCR) was devised for the identification of L1014F-kdr mutation in An.
      subpictus resulting from either type of point mutation. Genotyping of samples
      with PIRA-PCR revealed high frequency (82%) of L1014F-kdr mutation in the study
      area.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Polymorphic Microsatellite Markers from the
      Malaria Vector Anopheles fluviatilis Species T (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 408-12
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjv007 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis James is an important malaria vector in India, Pakistan,
      Nepal, and Iran. It has now been recognized as a complex of at least four sibling
      species-S, T, U, and V, among which species T is the most widely distributed
      species throughout India. The taxonomic status of these species is confusing
      owing to controversies prevailing in the literature. In addition, chromosomal
      inversion genotypes, which were considered species-diagnostic for An. fluviatilis
      species T, are unreliable due to the existence of polymorphism in some
      populations. To study the genetic diversity at population level, we isolated and 
      characterized 20 microsatellite markers from microsatellite-enriched genomic DNA 
      library of An. fluviatilis T, of which 18 were polymorphic while two were
      monomorphic. The number of alleles per locus among polymorphic markers ranged
      from 4 to 19, and values for observed and expected heterozygosities varied from
      0.352 to 0.857 and from 0.575 to 0.933, respectively. Thirteen markers had
      cross-cryptic species transferability to species S and U of the Fluviatilis
      Complex. This study provides a promising genetic tool for the population genetic 
      analyses of An. fluviatilis.

TI  - Eco-friendly control of malaria and arbovirus vectors using the mosquitofish
      Gambusia affinis and ultra-low dosages of Mimusops elengi-synthesized silver
      nanoparticles: towards an integrative approach?
PG  - 20067-83
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-5253-5 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people
      worldwide. However, the use of synthetic insecticides to control Culicidae may
      lead to high operational costs and adverse non-target effects. Plant-borne
      compounds have been proposed for rapid extracellular synthesis of mosquitocidal
      nanoparticles. Their impact against biological control agents of mosquito larval 
      populations has been poorly studied. We synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNP)
      using the aqueous leaf extract of Mimusops elengi as a reducing and stabilizing
      agent. The formation of AgNP was studied using different biophysical methods,
      including UV-vis spectrophotometry, TEM, XRD, EDX and FTIR. Low doses of AgNP
      showed larvicidal and pupicidal toxicity against the malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi and the arbovirus vector Aedes albopictus. AgNP LC50 against A.
      stephensi ranged from 12.53 (I instar larvae) to 23.55 ppm (pupae); LC50 against 
      A. albopictus ranged from 11.72 ppm (I) to 21.46 ppm (pupae). In the field, the
      application of M. elengi extract and AgNP (10 x LC50) led to 100 % larval
      reduction after 72 h. In adulticidal experiments, AgNP showed LC50 of 13.7 ppm
      for A. stephensi and 14.7 ppm for A. albopictus. The predation efficiency of
      Gambusia affinis against A. stephensi and A. albopictus III instar larvae was
      86.2 and 81.7 %, respectively. In AgNP-contaminated environments, predation was
      93.7 and 88.6 %, respectively. This research demonstrates that M.
      elengi-synthesized AgNP may be employed at ultra-low doses to reduce larval
      populations of malaria and arbovirus vectors, without detrimental effects on
      predation rates of mosquito natural enemies, such as larvivorous fishes.

TI  - S argassum muticum-synthesized silver nanoparticles: an effective control tool
      against mosquito vectors and bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases represent a deadly threat for millions of people
      worldwide. Furthermore, pathogens and parasites polluting water also constitute a
      severe plague for populations of developing countries. In this research, silver
      nanoparticles (AgNP) were synthesized using the aqueous extract of the seaweed
      Sargassum muticum. The production of AgNP was confirmed by surface plasmon
      resonance band illustrated in UV-vis spectrophotometry. AgNP were characterized
      by FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses. AgNP were mostly spherical in shape,
      crystalline in nature, with face-centered cubic geometry, and mean size was 43-79
      nm. Toxicity of AgNP was assessed against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus. In laboratory, AgNP were highly toxic against larvae and 
      pupae of the three mosquito species. Maximum efficacy was observed against A.
      stephensi larvae, with LC50 ranging from 16.156 ppm (larva I) to 28.881 ppm
      (pupa). In the field, a single treatment with AgNP (10 x LC50) in water storage
      reservoirs was effective against the three mosquito vectors, allowing complete
      elimination of larval populations after 72 h. In ovicidal experiments, egg
      hatchability was reduced by 100% after treatment with 30 ppm of AgNP.
      Ovideterrence assays highlighted that 10 ppm of AgNP reduced oviposition rates of
      more than 70% in A. aegypti, A. stephensi, and C. quinquefasciatus (OAI = -0.61, 
      -0.63, and -0.58, respectively). Antibacterial properties of AgNP were evaluated 
      against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi using the 
      agar disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration protocol. AgNP tested at
      50 ppm evoked growth inhibition zones larger than 5 mm in all tested bacteria.
      Overall, the chance to use S. muticum-synthesized AgNP for control of mosquito
      vectors seems promising since they are effective at low doses and may constitute 
      an advantageous alternative to build newer and safer mosquito control tools. This
      is the first report about ovicidal activity of metal nanoparticles against
      mosquito vectors.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In the present study, silver nanoparticles
      (AgNPs) synthesized using Cassia roxburghii plant leaf extract against Anopheles 
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus were determined. Larvae were
      exposed to varying concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (12, 24, 36, 48, and 60
      mug/mL) and aqueous leaf extracts (60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 mug/mL) for 24 h.
      The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform
      infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDX), transmission electron
      microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Compare to aqueous extracted
      synthesized AgNPs showed extensive mortality rate against An. stephensi, Ae.
      aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with the LC50 and LC90 values that were 26.35,
      28.67, 31.27 and 48.81, 53.24, and 58.11 mug/mL, respectively. No mortality was
      observed in the control. This is the first report on mosquito larvicidal activity
      of plant-synthesized nanoparticles. Thus, the use of C. roxburghii to synthesize 
      silver nanoparticles is a rapid, eco-friendly, and a single-step approach, and
      the AgNPs formed can be potential mosquito larvicidal agents. Therefore, this
      study proves that C. roxburghii is a potential bioresource for stable,
      reproducible nanoparticle synthesis (AgNPs) and also can be used as an efficient 
      mosquito control agent. This is the first report on the larvicidal activity of
      the plant extract and AgNPs.

AB  - Mosquitoes spread lethal diseases like malaria and dengue fever to humans.
      Considering mosquito vector control as one of the best alternatives to reduce new
      infections, here we have analyzed the effect of purified pigment prodigiosin
      extracted from Serratia marcescens (NMCC 75) against larval and pupal stages of
      Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Mosquito larvicidal activities 
      of purified prodigiosin revealed LC50 values of 14 +/- 1.2, 15.6 +/- 1.48, 18 +/-
      1.3, 21 +/- 0.87 microg/ml against early IInd, IIIrd, IVth instar and pupal
      stages of Ae. aegypti, respectively. LC50 values for An. stephensi were found to 
      be 19.7 +/- 1.12, 24.7 +/- 1.47, 26.6 +/- 1.67, 32.2 +/- 1.79 microg/ml against
      early IInd, IIIrd, IVth instar and pupae of An. stephensi, respectively. Further 
      investigations toward understanding modes of action revealed variations in the
      activities of esterases, acetylcholine esterases, phosphatases, proteases and
      total proteins in the fourth instar larvae of Ae. aegypti indicating intrinsic
      difference in biochemical features due to prodigiosin treatment. Although there
      was no inhibition of enzymes like catalase and oxidase but may have profound
      inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or H(+)-V-ATPase which is indicated by
      change in the pH of midgut and caeca of mosquito larvae. This reduced pH may be
      possibly due to the proton pump inhibitory activity of prodigiosin. Pure
      prodigiosin can prove to be an important molecule for mosquito control at larval 
      and pupal stages of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi. This is the first report on
      the mosquito pupaecidal activity of prodigiosin and its possible mechanism of
      action.

TI  - Insecticide Resistance in Areas Under Investigation by the International Centers 
      of Excellence for Malaria Research: A Challenge for Malaria Control and
      Elimination.
PG  - 69-78
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0844 [doi]
AB  - Scale-up of the main vector control interventions, residual insecticides sprayed 
      on walls or structures and/or impregnated in bed nets, together with prompt
      diagnosis and effective treatment, have led to a global reduction in malaria
      transmission. However, resistance in vectors to almost all classes of
      insecticides, particularly to the synthetic pyrethroids, is posing a challenge to
      the recent trend of declining malaria. Ten International Centers of Excellence
      for Malaria Research (ICEMR) located in the most malaria-endemic regions of the
      world are currently addressing insecticide resistance in the main vector
      populations, which not only threaten hope for elimination in malaria-endemic
      countries but also may lead to reversal where notable reductions in malaria have 
      been documented. This communication illustrates the current status of insecticide
      resistance with a focus on the countries where activities are ongoing for 9 out
      of the 10 ICEMRs. Most of the primary malaria vectors in the ICEMR countries
      exhibit insecticide resistance, albeit of varying magnitude, and spanning all
      mechanisms of resistance. New alternatives to the insecticides currently
      available are still to be fully developed for deployment. Integrated vector
      management principles need to be better understood and encouraged, and viable
      insecticide resistance management strategies need to be developed and
      implemented.

TI  - Entomological Monitoring and Evaluation: Diverse Transmission Settings of ICEMR
      Projects Will Require Local and Regional Malaria Elimination Strategies.
PG  - 28-41
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0009 [doi]
AB  - The unprecedented global efforts for malaria elimination in the past decade have 
      resulted in altered vectorial systems, vector behaviors, and bionomics. These
      changes combined with increasingly evident heterogeneities in malaria
      transmission require innovative vector control strategies in addition to the
      established practices of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual
      spraying. Integrated vector management will require focal and tailored vector
      control to achieve malaria elimination. This switch of emphasis from universal
      coverage to universal coverage plus additional interventions will be reliant on
      improved entomological monitoring and evaluation. In 2010, the National
      Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) established a network of
      malaria research centers termed ICEMRs (International Centers for Excellence in
      Malaria Research) expressly to develop this evidence base in diverse malaria
      endemic settings. In this article, we contrast the differing ecology and
      transmission settings across the ICEMR study locations. In South America, Africa,
      and Asia, vector biologists are already dealing with many of the issues of
      pushing to elimination such as highly focal transmission, proportionate increase 
      in the importance of outdoor and crepuscular biting, vector species complexity,
      and "sub patent" vector transmission.

TI  - Urban Malaria: Understanding its Epidemiology, Ecology, and Transmission Across
      Seven Diverse ICEMR Network Sites.

AB  - A major public health question is whether urbanization will transform malaria
      from a rural to an urban disease. However, differences about definitions of urban
      settings, urban malaria, and whether malaria control should differ between rural 
      and urban areas complicate both the analysis of available data and the
      development of intervention strategies. This report examines the approach of the 
      International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) to urban malaria
      in Brazil, Colombia, India (Chennai and Goa), Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda. Its
      major theme is the need to determine whether cases diagnosed in urban areas were 
      imported from surrounding rural areas or resulted from transmission within the
      urban area. If infections are being acquired within urban areas, malaria control 
      measures must be targeted within those urban areas to be effective. Conversely,
      if malaria cases are being imported from rural areas, control measures must be
      directed at vectors, breeding sites, and infected humans in those rural areas.
      Similar interventions must be directed differently if infections were acquired
      within urban areas. The hypothesis underlying the ICEMR approach to urban malaria
      is that optimal control of urban malaria depends on accurate epidemiologic and
      entomologic information about transmission.

AB  - The study of the three protagonists in malaria-the Plasmodium parasite, the
      Anopheles mosquito, and the human host-is key to developing methods to control
      and eventually eliminate the disease. Genomic technologies, including the recent 
      development of next-generation sequencing, enable interrogation of this triangle 
      to an unprecedented level of scrutiny, and promise exciting progress toward
      real-time epidemiology studies and the study of evolutionary adaptation. We
      discuss the use of genomics by the International Centers of Excellence for
      Malaria Research, a network of field sites and laboratories in malaria-endemic
      countries that undertake cutting-edge research, training, and technology transfer
      in malarious countries of the world.

AB  - Mosquitoes are the vector of more diseases and cause major health problems like
      malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and lymphatic filariasis. This article deals with
      the mosquito larvicidal activity of Chloroxylon swietenia Dc bark extracts
      against late third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and
      Anopheles stephensi. Methanolic crude extract of Ch. swietenia bark was obtained 
      by soxhlet apparatus and aqueous crude extract by cold percolation method. The
      range of concentrations of the crude extracts used was 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250
      ppm. The mortality and lethal concentration (LC50 and LC90) was calculated after 
      a 24-h exposure period. Both the extracts showed trustworthy larvicidal activity.
      The larvicidal activity of the methanol extract of Ch. swietenia bark was higher 
      than the aqueous extract, and the LC50 and the LC90 values of the methanol
      extract were found to be 124.70 and 226.26 mug/ml (Ae. aegypti), 130.57 and
      234.67 ppm (Cu. quinquefasciatus), and 137.55 and 246.09 ppm (An. stephensi). The
      LC50 and the LC90 values of the aqueous extract were found to be 133.10 and
      238.93 ppm (Ae. aegypti), 136.45 and 242.47 ppm (Cu. quinquefasciatus), and
      139.43 and 248.64 ppm (An. stephensi). No mortality was observed in the control. 
      Methanolic crude extract Ch. swietenia bark shows higher activity against An.
      stephensi than the other two tested larvae and aqueous extract. The results of
      the present study propose a possible way for further investigations to find out
      the active molecule responsible for the larvicidal activity of Ch. swietenia bark
      extracts.

TI  - Seaweed-synthesized silver nanoparticles: an eco-friendly tool in the fight
      against Plasmodium falciparum and its vector Anopheles stephensi?
PG  - 4087-97
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4638-1 [doi]
AB  - Malaria, the most widespread mosquito-borne disease, affects 350-500 million
      people each year. Eco-friendly control tools against malaria vectors are urgently
      needed. This research proposed a novel method of plant-mediated synthesis of
      silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap seaweed extract of Ulva lactuca, acting
      as a reducing and capping agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-vis
      spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
      and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The U. lactuca extract and the green-synthesized
      AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi. In mosquitocidal assays, LC50 values of U. lactuca extract against A. 
      stephensi larvae and pupae were 18.365 ppm (I instar), 23.948 ppm (II), 29.701
      ppm (III), 37.517 ppm (IV), and 43.012 ppm (pupae). LC50 values of AgNP against
      A. stephensi were 2.111 ppm (I), 3.090 ppm (II), 4.629 ppm (III), 5.261 ppm (IV),
      and 6.860 ppm (pupae). Smoke toxicity experiments conducted against mosquito
      adults showed that U. lactuca coils evoked mortality rates comparable to the
      permethrin-based positive control (66, 51, and 41%, respectively). Furthermore,
      the antiplasmodial activity of U. lactuca extract and U. lactuca-synthesized AgNP
      was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of
      Plasmodium falciparum. Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of U.
      lactuca were 57.26 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 66.36 mug/ml (CQ-r); U. lactuca-synthesized 
      AgNP IC50 values were 76.33 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 79.13 mug/ml (CQ-r). Overall, our
      results highlighted out that U. lactuca-synthesized AgNP may be employed to
      develop newer and safer agents for malaria control.

AB  - AgDNV is a powerful gene transduction tool and potential biological control agent
      for Anopheles mosquitoes. Using a GFP reporter virus system, we investigated
      AgDNV host range specificity in four arthropod cell lines (derived from An.
      gambiae, Aedes albopictus and Drosophila melanogaster) and six mosquito species
      from 3 genera (An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. stephensi, Ae. albopictus, Ae.
      aegypti and Culex tarsalis). In vitro, efficient viral invasion, replication and 
      GFP expression was only observed in MOS55 An. gambiae cells. In vivo, high levels
      of GFP were observed in An. gambiae mosquitoes. Intermediate levels of GFP were
      observed in the closely related species An. arabiensis. Low levels of GFP were
      observed in An. stephensi, Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti and Cx. tarsalis. These
      results suggest that AgDNV is a specific gene transduction tool for members of
      the An. gambiae species complex, and could be potentially developed into a
      biocontrol agent with minimal off-target effects.

LID - 10.1242/bio.012294 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito salivary glands are well known to facilitate meal acquisition, however
      the fundamental question on how adult female salivary gland manages molecular
      responses during sugar versus blood meal uptake remains unanswered. To
      investigate these responses, we analyzed a total of 58.5 million raw reads
      generated from two independent RNAseq libraries of the salivary glands collected 
      from 3-4 day-old sugar and blood fed Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes.
      Comprehensive functional annotation analysis of 10,931 contigs unraveled that
      salivary glands may encode diverse nature of proteins in response to distinct
      physiological feeding status. Digital gene expression analysis and PCR validation
      indicated that first blood meal significantly alters the molecular architecture
      of the salivary glands. Comparative microscopic analysis also revealed that first
      blood meal uptake not only causes an alteration of at least 12-22% of
      morphological features of the salivary glands but also results in cellular
      changes e.g. apoptosis, confirming together that adult female salivary glands are
      specialized organs to manage meal specific responses. Unraveling the underlying
      mechanism of mosquito salivary gene expression, controlling dual feeding
      associated responses may provide a new opportunity to control vector borne
      diseases.

AB  - Silver and gold nanoparticles of Jasminum nervosum L. had unique optical
      properties such as broad absorbance band in the visible region of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. Characterization of the nanoparticles using UV
      spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
      and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the particles were silver
      (AgNPs) and gold (AuNPs) ranging between 4-22 and 2-20 nm with an average
      particles size of 9.4 and 10 nm, respectively. AgNPs and AuNPs of J. nervosum had
      high larvicidal activity on the filarial and arboviral vector, Culex
      quinquefasciatus, than the leaf aqueous extract. Observed lethal concentrations
      (LC50 and LC95) against the third instar larvae were 57.40 and 144.36 mug/ml for 
      AgNPs and 82.62 and 254.68 mug/ml for AuNPs after 24 h treatment, respectively.
      The lethal time to kill 50% of C. quinquefasciatus larvae were 2.24 and 4.51 h at
      150 mug/ml of AgNPs and AuNPs, respectively, while in the case of aqueous leaf
      extract of J. nervosum it was 9.44 h at 500 mug/ml (F 2,14 = 397.51, P < 0.0001).
      The principal component analysis plot presented differential clustering of the
      aqueous leaf extract, AgNP and AuNPs in relation to lethal dose and lethal time. 
      It is concluded from the present findings that the biosynthesised AgNPs and AuNPs
      using leaf aqueous extract of J. nervosum could be an environmentally safer
      nanobiopesticide, and provided potential larvicidal effect on C. quinquefasciatus
      larvae which could be used for prevention of several dreadful diseases.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were successfully synthesised from aqueous silver
      nitrate using the extracts of Arachis hypogaea peels. The synthesised SNPs were
      characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis, X-ray
      diffraction, transmission electron microscopy analysis and high-resonance
      scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. AgNPs
      were well defined and measured 20 to 50 nm in size. The nanoparticles were
      crystallized with a face-centered cubic structure. Larvicidal activity of
      synthesised AgNPs from A. hypogaea peels was tested for their larvicidal activity
      against the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti (Yellow fever), Anopheles
      stephensi (Human malaria). The results suggest that the synthesised AgNPs have
      the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly resource for the control of A. 
      aegypti and A. stephensi. This study provides the first report on the mosquito
      larvicidal activity of synthesised AgNPs from A. hypogaea peels against vectors
      of malaria and dengue.

TI  - Transmission dynamics & epidemiology of malaria in two tribal districts in Madhya
      Pradesh, India.
PG  - 556-66
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epidemiology and transmission of malaria vary within
      the tribal areas with the variation in topography, forest cover and type of
      forest. For the control of disease, understanding of the dynamics of transmission
      in the varied ecological situation is essential. This study was carried out in
      the two distinct tribal areas- Baiga Chak (thick forested area) of Dindori
      district and Bichhia block (forest fringe area) of Mandla district, Madhya
      Prasdesh, India, to understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of
      malaria. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected using hand catch and whole night
      collections to determine the proportion of vectors, their density and
      seasonality. Vector incrimination was done by sporozoite ELISA and feeding
      preferences of vector by gel diffusion method. Active fever surveys were carried 
      out fortnightly to determine the age specific malaria parasite rates among the
      inhabitants of two areas. RESULTS: Density of Anopheles culicifacies was
      significantly higher in Bichhia while the density of An. fluviatilis was higher
      in Baiga Chak. An. culicifacies was incriminated from both the areas while An.
      fluviatilis was incriminated from Baiga Chak only. Malaria slide positivity rate 
      (SPR) was significantly higher (OR=3.7 95%CI, 3.1-4.4) in Baiga Chak (28.2%) than
      Bichhia (9.6%). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The features of malaria
      transmission in tribal areas differed from those reported in rural or semirural
      population. Site-specific and region-specific studies are required to develop
      appropriate intervention measures to control malaria.

TI  - Malaria situation in India with special reference to tribal areas.
PG  - 537-45
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In India, malaria is a major public health problem in
      States having predominantly tribal population. The objective of this analysis was
      to find out the incidence of malaria in various States/districts having varied
      proportions of tribal population using National Vector Borne Disease Control
      Programme (NVBDCP) data. METHODS: States and districts were classified into three
      categories based on proportions of Scheduled Tribes (ST) population as <10,
      10-29.9 and 30 per cent + ST population. Five year average (2008-2012) of all
      important malaria indicators collected by NVBDCP was taken to normalize the
      effect of annual fluctuations in malaria incidence. RESULTS: State level analysis
      revealed that ten States/UTs with 30 per cent or more tribal population
      comprising only three per cent of total population, contributed 14 per cent of
      total malaria, 21 per cent Plasmodium falciparum and 29 per cent of deaths due to
      malaria. Similarly, district level analysis showed that districts with 30 per
      cent or more tribal population comprising about eight per cent country's
      population contributed to 46 per cent of total malaria cases, 70 per cent P.
      falciparum and 47 per cent malarial deaths in the country. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that the neglect of the ethnic communities in
      tribal areas would be detrimental to the overall reduction of morbidity and
      mortality due to malaria. The fight against the increasing burden of malaria in
      tribal belt requires adoption of multiple approaches and socio-economic
      development of the tribal communities.

PG  - 525-36
AB  - Malaria epidemiology is complex due to multiplicity of disease vectors, sibling
      species complex and variations in bionomical characteristics, vast varied
      terrain, various ecological determinants. There are six major mosquito vector
      taxa in India, viz. Anopheles culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, An. stephensi, An.
      minimus, An. dirus and An. sundaicus. Among these, An. culicifacies is widely
      distributed and considered the most important vector throughout the plains and
      forests of India for generating bulk of malaria cases (>60% annually). Major
      malaria epidemics are caused by An. culicifaices. It is also the vector of tribal
      malaria except parts of Odisha and Northeastern States of India. An. culicifacies
      has been the cause of perennial malaria transmission in forests, and over the
      years penetrated the deforested areas of Northeast. An. culicifacies participates
      in malaria transmission either alone or along with An. stephensi or An.
      fluviatilis. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) spends 
      about 80 per cent malaria control budget annually in the control of An.
      culicifacies, yet it remains one of the most formidable challenges in India. With
      recent advances in molecular biology there has been a significant added knowledge
      in understanding the biology, ecology, genetics and response to interventions,
      requiring stratification for cost-effective and sustainable malaria control.
      Research leading to newer interventions that are evidence-based, community
      oriented and sustainable would be useful in tackling the emerging challenges in
      malaria control. Current priority areas of research should include in-depth
      vector biology and control in problem pockets, preparation of malaria-risk maps
      for focused and selective interventions, monitoring insecticide resistance,
      cross-border initiative and data sharing, and coordinated control efforts for
      achieving transmission reduction, and control of drug-resistant malaria. The
      present review on An. culicifacies provides updated information on vector biology
      and control outlining thrust areas of research.

AB  - Microbial control agents offer alternatives to chemical pest control, as they can
      be more selective than chemical insecticides. The present study evaluates the
      mosquito larvicidal and pupicidal potential of fungus mycelia using ethyl acetate
      and methanol solvent extracts produced by Aspergillus terreus against Anopheles
      stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti. The A. terreus mycelia were
      extracted after 15 days from Sabouraud dextrose broth medium. The ethyl acetate
      extracts showed lethal concentration that kills 50% of the exposed larvae (LC50) 
      and lethal concentration that kills 90% of the exposed larvae (LC90) values of
      the first, second, third, and fourth instar larvae of An. stephensi (LC50 =
      97.410, 102.551, 29.802, and 8.907; LC90 = 767.957, 552.546, 535.474, and 195.677
      mug/ml), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 89.584, 74.689, 68.265, and 67.40; LC90 =
      449.091, 337.355, 518.793, and 237.347 mug/ml), and Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 83.541,
      84.418, 80.407, and 95.926; LC90 = 515.464, 443.167, 387.910, and 473.998
      mug/ml). Pupicidal activity of mycelium extracts was tested against An. stephensi
      (LC50 = 25.228, LC90 = 140.487), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 54.525, LC90 =
      145.366), and Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 10.536, LC90 = 63.762 mug/ml). At higher
      concentration (500 mug/ml), mortality starts within the first 6 h of exposure.
      One hundred percent mortality occurs at 24-h exposure. The overall result
      observed that effective activity against selected mosquito larvae and pupae after
      24 h was a dose and time-dependent activity. These ensure that the resultant
      mosquito population reduction is substantial even where the larvicidal and
      pupicidal potential is minimal. The FTIR spectra of ethyl acetate extract reflect
      prominent peaks (3448.32, 3000.36, 2914.59, 2118.73, 1668.21, 1436.87, 1409.02,
      954.33, 901.13, and 704.67 cm(-1)). The spectra showed a sharp absorption band at
      1314.66 cm(-1) assigned to wagging vibration of the C-H group. The band at
      1023.59 cm(-1) developed for C-O and C=N, respectively, and was commonly found in
      carboxylic acid and amine groups. GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extracts showed
      the presence of six compounds, of which the major compounds were identified as
      n-hexadecanoic acid (15.31%) and methyl 12,15-octadecadienoate (31.989%), based
      on their peak molecular weight. The HPLC analysis result highlights that the A.
      terreus ethyl acetate extract was compared with pure n-hexadecanoic acid which
      resulted in similar retention time of 19.52 and 19.38, respectively. Thus, the
      active compound produced by this species would be more useful against vectors
      responsible for diseases of public health importance. This is the first report on
      mosquito larvicidal and pupicidal activity of ethyl acetate extract produced by
      A. terreus species.

AB  - Mosquitoes have developed resistance to various synthetic insecticides, making
      their control increasingly difficult. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve 
      as suitable natural control. This study evaluates the toxic potential of Ocimum
      canum (Sims) leaf extract and powder against Anopheles stephensi (Liston), Aedes 
      aegypti (Lin) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) larval and adult mosquitoes.
      Larval mortality was observed after 24 h recovery period and adult smoke toxicity
      observed for 40 min duration at 10 min interval. Methanol extract of O. canum
      showed highest larval mortality against the larvae of C. quinquefasciatus LC50 = 
      28.3225, LC90 = 44.1150; Ae. aegypti LC50 = 43.327, LC90 = 61.249; and An.
      stephensi LC50 = 30.2001, LC90 = 48.2866 ppm. The smoke toxicities were 93%
      mortality in C. quinquefasciatus, 74% in Ae. aegypti and 79% in An. stephensi
      adults, respectively, whereas 100% mortality was recorded in the commercial
      mosquito control. Our results suggest that O. canum leaf extract and powder are
      natural insecticide, and ideal eco friendly approach for mosquito control.

AB  - Each year, mosquito-borne diseases infect nearly 700 million people, resulting to
      more than 1 million deaths. In this study, we evaluated the larvicidal,
      pupicidal, and smoke toxicity of Senna occidentalis and Ocimum basilicum leaf
      extracts against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. Furthermore, the
      antiplasmodial activity of plant extracts was evaluated against chloroquine
      (CQ)-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum.
      In larvicidal and pupicidal experiments, S. occidentalis LC50 ranged from 31.05
      (I instar larvae) to 75.15 ppm (pupae), and O. basilicum LC50 ranged from 29.69
      (I instar larvae) to 69 ppm (pupae). Smoke toxicity experiments conducted against
      adults showed that S. occidentalis and O. basilicum coils evoked mortality rates 
      comparable to the pyrethrin-based positive control (38, 52, and 42%,
      respectively). In antiplasmodial assays, Senna occidentalis 50% inhibitory
      concentration (IC50) were 48.80 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 54.28 mug/ml (CQ-r), while O.
      basilicum IC50 were 68.14 mug/ml (CQ-s) and 67.27 mug/ml (CQ-r). Overall, these
      botanicals could be considered as potential sources of metabolites to build newer
      and safer malaria control tools.

TI  - Resistance Mechanisms of Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) to Temephos.
PG  - 71-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles stephensi is a sub-tropical species and has been considered
      as one of the most important vector of human malaria throughout the Middle East
      and South Asian region including the malarious areas of southern Iran. Current
      reports confirmed An. stephensi resistance to temephos in Oman and India.
      However, there is no comprehensive research on mechanisms of temephos resistance 
      in An. stephensi in the literature. This study was designed in order to clarify
      the enzymatic and molecular mechanisms of temephos resistance in this species.
      METHODS: Profile activities of alpha- and ss-esterases, mixed function oxidase
      (MFO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), insensitive acetylcholinesterase, and
      para-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA)-esterase enzymes were tested for An. stephensi
      strain with resistance ratio of 15.82 to temephos in comparison with susceptible 
      strain. RESULTS: Results showed that the mean activity of alpha-EST, GST and AChE
      enzymes were classified as altered indicating metabolic mechanisms have
      considerable role in resistance of An. stephensi to temephos. Molecular study
      using PCR-RFLP method to trace the G119S mutation in ACE-1 gene showed lack of
      the mutation responsible for organophosphate insecticide resistance in the
      temephos-selected strain of An. stephensi. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the
      altered enzymes but not targets site insensitivity of ACE-1 are responsible for
      temephos resistance in An. stephensi in south of Iran.

TI  - Distribution of Anopheles culicifacies and Detection of its Sibling Species E
      from Madhya Pradesh: Central India.
PG  - 186-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies is an important vector of malaria in Southeast
      Asia, contributing to almost 70% of malaria cases in India. It exists as a
      complex of five morphologically indistinguishable species A, B, C, D and E with
      varied geographical distribution patterns. In India, 8% of the total population
      of Madhya Pradesh (Central India) contributes about 30% of total malaria cases,
      60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths. An. culicifacies is the 
      major malaria vector in this state. Vector control mainly relies on the proper
      identification and distribution of vector species exists in a particular area.
      The present study was carried out to identify the distribution of An.
      culicifacies sibling species in certain endemic district of Central India, Madhya
      Pradesh. METHODS: The An. culicifacies mosquitoes collected from the study
      districts were identified morphologically. The genomic DNA was isolated from the 
      mosquitoes and subjected to Allele specific PCR targeting D3 domain of 28S
      ribosomal DNA. RESULTS: The mean prevalence of An. culicifacies during the study 
      period was in the range of 8-120 per man per hour (PMH). From the study areas
      species B was identified from Jabalpur, Chindwara and Hoshangabad, Species C from
      Hoshangabad only, Species D from Narsinghpur and Khandwa and sibling species E
      from Mandla, Chindwara and Hoshangabad respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the
      first report to detect species E from Madhya Pradesh region which necessitate for
      reconsideration of species distribution of each An. culicifacies sibling species 
      that would enable to develop required vector control strategies.

AB  - The present study deals with investigation of larvicidal activity and their
      chemical constituents of the essential oil from the seeds of Nigella sativa L.
      (Ranunculaceae). Totally, 18 chemical compounds were identified by GC and GC-MS
      analysis. Thymol (19.13 %) and alpha-phellandrene (14.9 %) were identified as
      major chemical components followed by camphor (12.14 %), borneol (11.31 %), and
      carvacrol (8.65 %). The larval mortality was observed after 12 and 24 h of
      exposure period. The results revealed that the essential oil were evaluated
      against the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. After 12 h of exposure period, the larvicidal activities were
      LC50 = 196.9 and LC90 = 523.5 ppm (A. aegypti), LC50 = 88.1 and LC90 = 272.4 ppm 
      (A.stephensi), and LC50 = 241.6 and LC90 = 545.4 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus), and
      the larvicidal activities after 24 h of exposure period were LC50 = 99.9 and LC90
      = 300.8 ppm (A. aegypti), LC50 = 53.9 and LC90 = 172.6 ppm (A. stephensi), and
      LC50 = 141.7 and LC90 = 364.0 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus). The results of the
      present study showed that the essential oil from seeds of N. sativa is
      inexpensive food formulation and new source of natural larvicidal agent.

TI  - Knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in Indian Anopheles culicifacies
      populations.
PG  - 333

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the primary vectors of malaria 
      in India responsible for the highest number of malaria cases. This vector is
      resistant to DDT in most parts of the country with indication of emerging
      resistance to pyrethroids. Since knockdown resistance (kdr) is known to confer
      cross-resistance between DDT and pyrethroids owing to a common target site of
      action, knowledge of prevalence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles is
      important from insecticide resistance management point of view. METHODS: Nine
      populations of An. culicifacies belonging to five states of India, representing
      northern, western and central-east India, were screened for the presence of two
      alternative kdr mutations L1014F and L1014S using PCR-based assays. Dead and
      alive mosquitoes, following WHO standard insecticide susceptibility test against 
      deltamethrin and DDT, were tested for allelic association. RESULTS: L1014F
      mutation was recorded in all populations studied except from Haryana and
      Rajasthan states in northern India, with low frequencies ranging between 0.012
      and 0.076; whereas presence of L1014S mutation was recorded in five populations
      only belonging to central-east India, with allelic frequencies ranging between
      0.010 and 0.046. Both the kdr mutant alleles were found mostly in heterozygous
      condition without deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Both mutations
      showed protection against deltamethrin whereas only L1014S mutation showed
      protection against DDT when tested using additive model. CONCLUSIONS: The two
      L1014-kdr mutations, L1014F and L1014S, co-occurred in five populations belonging
      to Chhattisgarh and Odisha states of India whereas L1014F was present in all
      populations studied except populations from northern states. Both kdr mutations
      were found with very low allelic frequencies mostly in heterozygous condition and
      exhibited protection against deltamethrin.

TI  - Karyotypic assignment of Sri Lankan Anopheles culicifacies species B and E does
      not correlate with cytochrome oxidase subunit I and microsatellite genotypes.
PG  - 327
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-0944-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of species B and E in the Anopheles culicifacies
      complex in the Indian subcontinent has been based on Y-chromosome karyotype.
      Since no detectable variations were previously found in DNA markers commonly used
      for sibling species identification, further molecular characterization using
      cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and microsatellite markers was carried out on 
      Y-chromosome karyotyped Anopheles culicifacies specie B and E from Unnichchai,
      Kallady and Ranawarunawa in Sri Lanka. FINDINGS: COI sequence analysis (n = 22)
      revealed the presence of nine unique haplotypes with six in each species. Three
      haplotypes were shared by both species. The two sibling species had a pairwise
      FST value of 1.338 (p < 0.05) with the number of migrants (Nm) value <1. The
      genetic structure analysis resulted in two genetic clusters not 100% associated
      with karyotypes. While none of the species B were incorrectly assigned two were
      inconclusive. Five out of 26 specimens karyotyped as species E were incorrectly
      assigned, while further 9 were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The new molecular data 
      support the existence of two genetically different populations of the
      Culicifacies Complex in Sri Lanka that are not associated with the Y-chromosome
      karyotype. Detailed analysis with more microsatellite markers and assortative
      mating experiments are needed to establish the presence of the two genetically
      distinct populations and relate them to Y-chromosome morphology.

TI  - Small-scale evaluation of the efficacy and residual activity of
      alpha-cypermethrin WG (250 g AI/kg) for indoor spraying in comparison with
      alpha-cypermethrin WP (50 g AI/kg) in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with different formulations of
      insecticides is being used for the control of mosquito vectors in many countries.
      In the present study, residual efficacy and duration of effectiveness of IRS with
      alpha-cypermethrin WG-SB (250 g AI/m2) formulation was compared with WP
      formulation (50 g AI/kg) in a small scale (Phase II) field trial. METHODS: Two
      dosages, i.e. 20 and 30 mg AI/m2, were used and the efficacy and duration of
      effectiveness was assessed on alpha-cypermethrin susceptible population of
      Anopheles stephensi. Four types of surfaces were selected, namely cement wall
      with distemper coating, cement wall with lime coating, mud wall with lime
      coating, and brick wall unpainted. Spraying was carried out with Hudson sprayer
      fitted with control flow valve. Bioassays were carried out at weekly and then
      fortnightly intervals. Chemical analysis of filter paper samples collected from
      the sprayed surfaces was done at Walloon Agricultural Research Institute,
      Gembloux, Belgium. RESULTS: Alpha-cypermethrin WG-SB showed residual efficacy
      (>80% mortality) for 13-15 weeks for the 20 mg/m2 dosage and 13-16 weeks for the 
      30 mg/m2 dosage, whereas alpha-cypermethrin WP showed residual efficacy for 11-15
      weeks for the 20 mg/m2 dosage and 11-14 weeks for the 30 mg/m2 dosage on the
      surfaces tested. The average of the applied to target dose ratio ranged from 0.89
      to 1.17 for alpha-cypermethrin WG-SB at 20 mg AI/m2, 0.83-1.80 for the WG-SB at
      30 mg AI/m2, 0.87-1.66 for alpha-cypermethrin WP at 20 mg AI/m2, and 0.68-1.06
      for WP at 30 mg AI/m2. No adverse events were reported, either by the spray men
      or the household inhabitants, during and after the spray operations. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results suggest that the dose of WG 30 mg/m2 gave slightly longer effective
      residual action against malaria vector (16 weeks) on most common indoor surfaces 
      and could be used for effective control of Anopheles mosquitoes. The WG
      formulation was found to be easy to handle, no smell was reported during the
      spraying and was found to be operationally acceptable for indoor residual
      spraying.

AB  - There is an exigent necessity for development of environmental friendly
      bio-control agent(s) for elimination of mosquito due to increased resistance
      resurgence against synthetic control agents. Mosquito control strategy will lay a
      strong foundation to malaria exclusion or it can be curbed to certain level
      especially in the developing nations. In this study, silver nanoparticles were
      synthesized by green chemistry approach using Tridax procumbens leaf extract as a
      reducing agent. The reaction medium involved in the synthesis process was
      optimized by statistical experimental design using response surface methodology
      to obtain better yield, uniform size, shape and stability. Further, these
      synthesized nanoparticles were confirmed through UV-Visible, FT-IR spectroscopy, 
      PSA and SEM Subsequently, the bioefficacy of these particles were investigated on
      Anopheles stephensi for larvicidal and pupicidal activity. Interestingly, time
      period of 90 min, temperature of 76+/-2 degrees C, pH 7.2+/-2, 2 mM silver
      nitrate (AgNO3), 3mM PEG and 2mM PVP showed excellent parameters for bioprocess
      design for large scale production of stabilized nanoparticles. A concentration of
      5 ppm of PVP stabilized nanoparticles exhibited 100% mortality. Thus, the
      obtained results clearly suggest that silver nanoparticles stabilized by PEG and 
      PVP may have important function as stabilizers, dispersants as well as larvicides
      for mosquito control.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit several diseases which cause millions of deaths every year.
      The use of synthetic insecticides to control mosquitoes caused diverse effects to
      the environment, mammals, and high manufacturing cost. The present study was
      aimed to test the larvicidal activity of green synthesized silver nanoparticles
      using Annona muricata plant leaf extract against third instar larvae of three
      medically important mosquitoes, i.e., Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus. The different concentrations of green synthesized Ag
      Nanoparticles (AgNPs; 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 mug mL(-1)) and aqueous crude leaf
      extract (30, 60, 90, 120, 150 mug mL(-1)) were tested against the larvae for 24
      h. Significant larval mortality was observed after the treatment of A. muricata
      for all mosquitoes with lowest LC50 and LC90 values, viz., A. aegypti (LC50 and
      LC90 values of 12.58 and 26.46 mug mL(-1)), A. stephensi (LC50 and LC90 values of
      15.28 and 31.91 mug mL(-1)) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC50 and LC90 values of
      18.77 and 35.72 mug mL(-1)), respectively. The synthesized AgNPs from A. muricata
      were highly toxic than aqueous crude extract. The nanoparticle characterization
      was done using spectral and microscopic analysis, namely UV-visible spectroscopy 
      which showed a sharp peak at 420 nm of aqueous medium containing AgNPs, X-ray
      diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the average crystalline size of synthesized
      AgNPs (approximately 45 nm), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
      study exhibited prominent peaks 3381.28, 2921.03, 1640.17, 1384.58, 1075.83, and 
      610.77 cm(-1). Particle size analysis (PSA) showed the size and distribution of
      AgNPs (103 nm); field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and
      high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis showed a
      spherical shape, size range from 20 to 53 nm; and energy-dispersive X-ray
      spectroscopy (EDX) reflects the chemical composition of synthesized AgNPs. Heat
      stability of the AgNPs was confirmed between the temperatures 20 to 70 degrees C.
      The result suggests that green synthesized AgNPs from A. muricata has the
      potential to be used as a low-cost and eco-friendly approach for the control of
      selected mosquitoes.

AB  - MicroRNAs are a ~22 nucleotide small non-coding RNAs found in animals, plants and
      viruses. They regulate key cellular processes by enhancing, degrading or
      silencing protein coding targets. Currently most of the data on miRNA is
      available from Drosophila . Given their important post-transcriptional role in
      several organisms, there is a need to understand the miRNA mediated processes in 
      normal and abnormal conditions. Here we report four novel microRNAs ast - mir -
      2502, ast - mir - 2559, ast - mir - 3868 and ast - mir - 9891 in Anopheles
      stephensi identified from a set of 3,052 transcriptome sequences, showing average
      minimum free energy of -31.8 kcal/mol of duplex formation with mRNA indicating
      their functional relevance. Phylogenetic study shows conservation of sequence
      signatures within the Class Insecta. Furthermore, 26 potential targets of these
      four miRNAs have been predicted that play an important role in the mosquito
      life-cycle. This work leads to novel leads and experimental possibilities for
      improved understanding of gene regulatory processes in mosquito.

TI  - Relative Abundance and Plasmodium Infection Rates of Malaria Vectors in and
      around Jabalpur, a Malaria Endemic Region in Madhya Pradesh State, Central India.
PG  - e0126932
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126932 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken in two Primary Health Centers (PHCs) of
      malaria endemic district Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh (Central India). METHODS: In 
      this study we had investigated the relative frequencies of the different
      anopheline species collected within the study areas by using indoor resting
      catches, CDC light trap and human landing methods. Sibling species of malaria
      vectors were identified by cytogenetic and molecular techniques. The role of each
      vector and its sibling species in the transmission of the different Plasmodium
      species was ascertained by using sporozoite ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 52,857
      specimens comprising of 17 anopheline species were collected by three different
      methods (39,964 by indoor resting collections, 1059 by human landing and 11,834
      by CDC light trap). Anopheles culicifacies was most predominant species in all
      collections (55, 71 and 32% in indoor resting, human landing and light trap
      collections respectively) followed by An. subpictus and An. annularis. All five
      sibling species of An. culicifacies viz. species A, B, C, D and E were found
      while only species T and S of An. fluviatilis were collected. The overall
      sporozoite rate in An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were 0.42% (0.25% for P. 
      falciparum and 0.17% for P. vivax) and 0.90% (0.45% for P. falciparum and 0.45%
      for P. vivax) respectively. An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were found
      harbouring both P. vivax variants VK-210 and VK-247, and P. falciparum. An.
      culicifacies sibling species C and D were incriminated as vectors during most
      part of the year while sibling species T of An. fluviatilis was identified as
      potential vector in monsoon and post monsoon season. CONCLUSIONS: An.
      culicifacies species C (59%) was the most abundant species followed by An.
      culicifacies D (24%), B (8.7%), E (6.7%) and A (1.5%). Among An. fluviatilis
      sibling species, species T was common (99%) and only few specimens of S were
      found. Our study provides crucial information on the prevalence of An.
      culicifacies and An. fluviatilis sibling species and their potential in malaria
      transmission which will assist in developing strategic control measures against
      these vectors.

AB  - The liver stages of the malaria parasite are clinically silent and constitute
      ideal targets for causal prophylactic drugs and vaccines. Cellular and molecular 
      events responsible for liver stage development are poorly characterized. Here, we
      show that sporozoite, liver stage tryptophan-rich protein (SLTRiP) forms large
      multimers. Mice immunized with a purified recombinant SLTRiP protein gave high
      antibody titers in both inbred and outbred mice. Immunized mice showed highly
      significant levels of protection upon challenge with sporozoites and exhibited
      10,000-fold fewer parasite 18S-rRNA copy numbers in their livers. The protection 
      offered by immunization with SLTRiP came mainly from T-cells, and antibodies had 
      little role to play despite their high titers. Immunofluorescence assays showed
      that SLTRiP is expressed in the sporozoite and early to late liver stages of
      malaria parasites. SLTRiP protein is exported to the cytosol of infected host
      cells during the early hours of parasite infection. Parasites deficient in SLTRiP
      were moderately defective in liver stage parasite development. A transcriptome
      profile of SLTRiP-deficient parasite-infected hepatocytes highlighted that SLTRiP
      interferes with multiple pathways in the host cell. We have demonstrated a role
      for SLTRiP in sporozoites and the liver stage of malaria parasites.

AB  - Organophosphate pesticides are widely used in vector mosquito management and
      agricultural pest management. These chemicals enter into natural water bodies and
      soil and cause hazards to the environment. The objective of this study was to
      prepare a natural pesticide which will not harm the environment and yet control
      vector mosquitoes. PONNEEM, a novel biopesticide, patented and prepared from the 
      oils of Azadirachta indica and Pongamia glabra, was tested against Anopheles
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. One hundred percent larvicidal and ovicidal
      activities were observed at 0.1-ppm concentration of PONNEEM against the two
      mosquito species under laboratory and sunlight conditions up to 12 months from
      the date of manufacture. Very high oviposition reduction of 26.46 and 32.16 % is 
      also recorded. Reductions in alpha-esterase level (0.0818 +/- 0.340 and 0.2188
      +/- 0.003), beta-esterase level (0.0866 +/- 0.026 and 0.0398 +/- 0.010 mug
      naphthol produced/min/mg larval protein), glutathione S-transferase enzyme
      (14.2571 +/- 0.51 and 15.3326 +/- 0.51 mumol/min/mg larval protein) and total
      protein levels (0.0390 +/- 0.008 and 0.1975 +/- 0.029 mg/individual larva in
      treated groups of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus at 0.1-ppm concentration, 
      respectively. The non-target organisms such as Gambusia affinis and Diplonychus
      indicus were not affected. Biopesticides are good alternatives to synthetic
      pesticides. PONNEEM can be effectively used for the management of human vector
      mosquitoes. Since it has a biodegradable nature and does not alter the
      environmental condition of water and soil.

AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens Migula (VCRC B426) produces a secondary metabolite, which
      was found to be active against pupae of vector mosquitoes namely Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti. The mosquito pupicidal
      metabolite from P. fluoescens was mass produced and separated by ethyl acetate
      extraction and purified further by silica gel column chromatography, FPLC, HPLC
      and TLC. The purified metabolite was characterized by NMR, FT-IR, LC-MS and
      MALDI-TOF. The FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR results showed that it is a rhamnolipid 
      (di-rhamnolipid). The matrix assisted laser desorption and
      ionization-time-of-flight spectrum of the sample showed predominant pupicidal
      component produced by P. fluorescens was the molecule mass of 673.40 Da. Owing to
      its high toxicity to mosquito pupae, especially Anopheles sp., and Aedes sp., the
      di-rhamnolipd has potential in the control of the vectors of dengue, chikungunya,
      yellow fever and malaria. This is the first report of mosquito pupicidal
      di-rhamnolipid from P. fluorescens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the larvicidal, ovicidal and repellent properties of
      solvent extracts of marine sponge Cliona celata (C. celata) (Grant) against the
      malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) Liston. METHODS: Marine
      sponge C. celata was thoroughly washed with distilled water and shade dried for
      48 h. Then the sponges were homogenized and extracted sequentially with hexane,
      ethyl acetate and methanol. Larvicidal and ovicidal activities were tested at
      four different concentrations viz., 62.5, 125.0, 250.0 and 500.0 ppm. For
      repellent study extracts were taken in three different concentrations viz., 5.0, 
      2.5, 1.0 mg/cm at. RESULTS: Among the three solvent extracts of C. celata,
      methanol extract showed the highest larvicidal activity at 500 ppm against the
      fourth instar larvae of An. stephensi. The LC50 and LC90 values of C. celata
      methanol extract were recorded as 80.61 and 220.81 ppm against An. stephensi
      larvae respectively. High ovicidal activity of 91.2% was recorded at 500 ppm
      concentration of methanol extract. The haxane extract was found to be the most
      effective protectant against the adult female mosquitoes of An. stephensi. The
      mean protection time recorded in hexane extract was up to 245 min at 5 mg/cm(2)
      dosage against An. stephensi adults. CONCLUSIONS: The screening results suggest
      that the hexane and methanol extracts of C. celata are promising in mosquito
      control. Considering these bioactivities, C. celata could be probed further to
      obtain some novel pesticidal molecules.

TI  - Role of underappreciated vectors in malaria transmission in an endemic region of 
      Bangladesh-India border.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the efforts of the National Malaria Control Programme,
      malaria remains as an important public health problem in Bangladesh, particularly
      in the south-eastern region bordering India. Successful malaria control
      strategies rely on a detailed understanding of the underlying causes of malaria
      transmission. Here, an entomological survey was conducted in a malaria endemic
      area of Bangladesh bordering India to investigate the Anopheles mosquito
      community and assess their Plasmodium infection status. METHODS: Monthly
      entomological collections were undertaken from October 2010 to September 2011 in 
      five villages in the Matiranga sub-district, Khagrachari district in Bangladesh, 
      bordering the Indian State of Tripura. CDC miniature light traps were placed
      inside houses to collect adult Anopheles mosquitoes. Following morphological and 
      molecular identification of the female Anopheles mosquitoes collected, they were 
      screened for circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf),
      Plasmodium vivax-210 (Pv-210) and Plasmodium vivax-247 (Pv-247), by ELISA to
      determine natural infection rates. Variation in Anopheles species composition,
      relative abundance and Plasmodium infection rates were analysed between sampled
      villages. RESULTS: A total of 2,027 female Anopheles were collected, belonging to
      20 species. Anopheles nivipes was the most abundant species in our test villages 
      during the peak malaria transmission season, and was observed sympatrically with 
      An. philippinensis in the studied area. However, in the dry off-peak season, An. 
      jeyporiensis was the most abundant species. Shannon's diversity index was highest
      in October (2.12) and evenness was highest in May (0.91). The CSP ELISA positive 
      rate overall was 0.44%. Anopheles karwari (n=2), An. barbirostris s.l. (n=1) and 
      An. vagus (n=1) were recorded positive for Pf. Anopheles kochi (n=1) was positive
      for Pv-210 while An. umbrosus (n=1), An. nivipes (n=1) and An. kochi (n=1) were
      positive for Pv-247. A mixed infection of Pf and Pv-247 was detected in An.
      barbirostris s.l.. CONCLUSION: High diversity of Anopheles species was observed
      in areas close to the international border where species that were underestimated
      for malaria transmission significantly outnumbered principal vector species and
      these may play a significantly heightened role in malaria transmission.

      mosquito Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 179

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in various
      biological processes including insect development. Anopheles stephensi serves as 
      primary vector of malaria parasite in Asia and exhibits holometabolous life cycle
      that involves four different stages of development. Regulation and role of
      mosquito miRNAs during various stages of mosquito development remain largely
      unknown. METHODS: High throughput small RNA sequencing was employed for
      identification and profiling of miRNAs across immature and adult stages of
      malaria vector, which were further validated using Northern hybridization and
      real time PCR. Target prediction and pathway analysis was carried out to
      understand the role of regulated miRNAs in insect development. Degradome
      sequencing was employed to identify cleaved targets of some regulated miRNAs.
      Loss of function strategy was employed for miR-989 to understand its probable
      role in female reproductive process. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing and data
      analysis revealed 111 and 14 known and novel miRNAs respectively across all
      stages of Anopheles stephensi. Nine miRNAs showed gender specific regulation
      across different stages of mosquito development. Analysis of miRNAs revealed
      regulation of 24 and 26 miRNAs across different stages of male and female
      mosquito development respectively. mRNA targets and significant pathways targeted
      by regulated miRNAs were identified for each stage of mosquito development.
      Degradome sequencing revealed twenty nine cleaved targets of insect miRNAs.
      MicroRNA-989 showed significant up-regulation in the adult female as compared to 
      adult male mosquito. Knockdown of miR-989 expression in adult female using miRNA 
      specific antagomir affected targets playing roles in protein binding, proteolysis
      and nucleic acid binding in ovary tissue of female mosquito post blood feeding.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive effort to understand regulation of
      Anopheles stephensi miRNAs across developmental stages of male and female
      mosquito. Preliminary role of regulated miRNAs in mosquito development was
      revealed by target prediction and pathway analysis. MicroRNA-989 emerged to have 
      important roles in adult female mosquitoes showing significant up-regulation
      which was further studied using miR-989 specific antagomir. This study provides
      insights into mosquito development and reproductive process and has implications 
      for effective control of mosquito population required for reducing spread of
      mosquito-borne infectious diseases.

AB  - A rapid bio-reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was achieved by Chloroxylon
      swietenia DC leaf extract (CSLE), which resulted in the formation of well
      dispersed C. swietenia gold nanoparticles (CSGNPs). The formation of GNPs was
      confirmed by color changes from yellowish green to purple and their
      characteristic peak at 545 nm. The characterization of synthesized CSGNPs was
      made through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
      (FTIR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) equipped with
      energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) followed by size and zeta potential
      analyses. The GC-MS profile of C. swietenia methanolic leaf extract (CSMLE)
      resulted 20 phytocomponents, among those heptacosanoic acid, 25-methyl-, methyl
      ester (C29H58O2) attributes highest peak area. The efficiency of the synthesized 
      CSMLE, CSGNPs and CSLE were tested against fourth instar larvae of malarial and
      dengue vector, which resulted more substantial upshot than with leaf extract
      treated. The Lethal concentration (LC50) values of CSMLE, CSGNPs and CSLE were
      found to be 0.509, 0.340, 0.423 ppm and 0.602, 0.188, 0.646 ppm on Aedes aegypti 
      and Anopheles stephensi, respectively. The findings form an important baseline
      information proceeding biologically innocuous biopesticide for controlling the
      malarial and dengue vectors.

AB  - Plant-borne compounds can be employed to synthesize mosquitocidal nanoparticles
      that are effective at low doses. However, how they affect the activity of
      mosquito predators in the aquatic environment is unknown. In this study, we
      synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuN) using the leaf extract of Cymbopogon
      citratus, which acted as a reducing and capping agent. AuN were characterized by 
      a variety of biophysical methods and sorted for size in order to confirm
      structural integrity. C. citratus extract and biosynthesized AuN were tested
      against larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and the dengue
      vector Aedes aegypti. LC(5)(0) of C. citratus extract ranged from 219.32 ppm to
      471.36 ppm. LC(5)(0) of AuN ranged from 18.80 ppm to 41.52 ppm. In laboratory,
      the predatory efficiency of the cyclopoid crustacean Mesocyclops aspericornis
      against A. stephensi larvae was 26.8% (larva I) and 17% (larva II), while against
      A. aegypti was 56% (I) and 35.1% (II). Predation against late-instar larvae was
      minimal. In AuN-contaminated environment,predation efficiency against A.
      stephensi was 45.6% (I) and 26.7% (II), while against A. aegypti was 77.3% (I)
      and 51.6% (II). Overall, low doses of AuN may help to boost the control of
      Anopheles and Aedes larval populations in copepod-based control programs.

TI  - Chlorfenapyr: irritant effect compared to other insecticides and its intrinsic
      toxicity in multiple-insecticide-susceptible and -resistant Anopheles stephensi
      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 99-103
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: For effective management of vector resistance there is a
      need for new insecticide molecules with novel modes of action. For desired toxic 
      effect of an insecticide, apart from other behavioural aspects, toxicity and
      chemical nature of the molecule are important that may cause irritability in the 
      mosquito to the insecticide affecting the uptake. In this study, a pyrrole class 
      insecticide, chlorfenapyr (a late acting insecticide) was tested for its
      irritability against multiple-insecticide-susceptible and -resistant strains of
      Anopheles stephensi Liston 1901 (Diptera: Culicidae). METHODS: Studies were
      conducted to assess the irritability due to chlorfenapyr, DDT, malathion,
      deltamethrin and permethrin and intrinsic toxicity of chlorfenapyr in
      multiple-insecticide-susceptible and -resistant laboratory strains of An.
      stephensi following standard WHO methods. RESULTS: Chlorfenapyr molecule has
      shown least irritant effect against susceptible and resistant strains among all
      the insecticides tested allowing more landing time to the vector species on the
      impregnated surfaces to pick-up lethal dose. CONCLUSION: Chlorfenapyr could be an
      ideal insecticide for management of multiple-insecticide-resistance including
      pyrethroids.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA-based genetic diversity of Anopheles nivipes in North East
      India.
PG  - 4236-4239
AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in north-east India mainly transmitted
      by Anopheles baimai and An. minimus while Anopheles nivipes plays an important
      supportive role. The genetic diversity of An. nivipes in north-east India was
      investigated by employing two mitochondrial DNA markers namely NADH dehydrogenase
      5 (ND5) and cytochrome oxidase sub unit II (COII). High genetic diversity in An. 
      nivipes was observed by the detection of 16 haplotypes among 30 sequences of ND5 
      gene and 29 haplotypes among 29 COII sequences. Anopheles nivipes of north-east
      India was significantly differentiated genetically with that of neighboring
      South-east Asian An. nivipes as revealed by pairwise FST values of 0.127 (p <
      0.01) and 0.044 (p < 0.001) for ND5 and COII genes, respectively, suggesting
      geographical barriers to gene flow in this species between the two geographical
      areas resulting in significant population structuring.
