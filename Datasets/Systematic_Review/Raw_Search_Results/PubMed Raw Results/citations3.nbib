TI  - The effect of sublethal exposure to temephos and propoxur on reproductive fitness
      and its influence on circadian rhythms of pupation and adult emergence in
      Anopheles stephensi Liston-a malaria vector.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of organophosphate
      and carbamate insecticides namely, temephos and propoxur respectively, on the
      life history of Anopheles stephensi Liston (Culicidae) under laboratory
      conditions. The late third instar larvae of the mosquito were exposed to
      sublethal concentrations of temephos and propoxur at LC(10), LC(30) and LC(50),
      respectively, and adult survivors were evaluated for fitness parameters.
      Sublethal effects were also evaluated in subsequent generations. Fecundity, egg
      hatchability, sex ratio, adult longevity and morphology of gonads were the end
      points studied and compared to the untreated control. Adverse changes in
      developmental traits were mainly observed in fecundity, egg hatchability and sex 
      ratio. However, significant differences in adult longevity were observed in the
      insecticide-exposed population. Pleiotropic effects through prolonged larval
      duration and enhanced longevity of adults were observed. Morphology of gonads in 
      the insecticide-exposed population was severely affected and is represented by
      rudimentary and atrophied testes, and the size of the vas deferens was very much 
      reduced when compared to that of the control. In another set of experiments,
      circadian rhythm (for pupation and adult emergence) of LC(10), LC(30) and LC(50) 
      values to abovementioned insecticides exposed to late third instar larvae was
      studied. Pupation and adult emergence rhythms were found to be disturbed with an 
      increase in concentrations of insecticides when compared to that of untreated
      control.

TI  - Mosquitocidal properties of Calotropis gigantea (Family: Asclepiadaceae) leaf
      extract and bacterial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis, against the mosquito
      vectors.
PG  - 531-44
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-2865-2 [doi]
AB  - Calotropis gigantea leaf extract and Bacillus thuringiensis were tested first to 
      fourth-instar larvae and pupae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. The medicinal plants were collected from the area around
      Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India. Calotropis gigantea leaf was washed
      with tap water and shade-dried at room temperature. An electrical blender
      powdered the dried plant materials (leaves). The powder 500 g of the leaf was
      extracted with 1.5 L of organic solvents of methanol for 8 h using a Soxhlet
      apparatus and filtered. The crude leaf extracts were evaporated to dryness in a
      rotary vacuum evaporator. The plant extract showed larvicidal and pupicidal
      effects after 24 h of exposure; no mortality was observed in the control group.
      For Calotropis gigantea, the median lethal concentration values (LC(50)) observed
      for the larvicidal and pupicidal activities against mosquito vector species
      Anopheles stephensi I to IV larval instars and pupae were 73.77, 89.64, 121.69,
      155.49, and 213.79 ppm; Aedes aegypti values were 92.27, 106.60, 136.48, 164.01, 
      and 202.56 ppm; and Culex quinquefasciatus values were 104.66, 127.71, 173.75,
      251.65, and 314.70 ppm, respectively. For B. thuringiensis, the LC(50) values of 
      I to IV larval instars and pupae of Anopheles stephensi were 37.24, 45.41, 57.82,
      80.09, and 98.34 ppm; Aedes aegypti values were 42.38, 51.90, 71.02, 96.17, and
      121.59 ppm; and Culex quinquefasciatus values were 55.85, 68.07, 94.11, 113.35,
      and 133.87 ppm, respectively. The study proved that the methanol leaf extract of 
      Calotropis gigantea and bacterial insecticide B. thuringiensis has mosquitocidal 
      property and was evaluated as target species of mosquito vectors. This is an
      ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of vector control programs.

TI  - Mosquito biting activity on humans & detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection
      in Anopheles stephensi in Goa, India.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of the bionomics of mosquitoes, especially of 
      disease vectors, is essential to plan appropriate vector avoidance and control
      strategies. Information on biting activity of vectors during the night hours in
      different seasons is important for choosing personal protection measures. This
      study was carried out to find out the composition of mosquito fauna biting on
      humans and seasonal biting trends in Goa, India. METHODS: Biting activities of
      all mosquitoes including vectors were studied from 1800 to 0600 h during 85
      nights using human volunteers in 14 different localities of three distinct
      ecotypes in Goa. Seasonal biting trends of vector species were analysed and
      compared. Seasonal biting periodicity during different phases of night was also
      studied using William's mean. RESULTS: A total of 4,191 mosquitoes of five genera
      and 23 species were collected. Ten species belonged to Anopheles, eight to Culex,
      three to Aedes and one each to Mansonia and Armigeres. Eleven vector species had 
      human hosts, including malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi (1.3%), An.
      fluviatilis (1.8%), and An. culicifacies (0.76%); filariasis vectors Culex
      quinquefasciatus (40.8%) and Mansonia uniformis (1.8%); Japanese encephalitis
      vectors Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (17.4%), Cx. vishnui (7.7%), Cx. pseudovishnui
      (0.1%), and Cx. gelidus (2.4%); and dengue and chikungunya vectors Aedes
      albopictus (0.9%) and Ae. aegypti (0.6%). Two An. stephensi of the total 831
      female anophelines, were found positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. The
      entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of P. falciparum was 18.1 and 2.35 for
      Panaji city and Goa, respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Most of the
      mosquito vector species were collected in all seasons and throughout the
      scotophase. Biting rates of different vector species differed during different
      phases of night and seasons. Personal protection methods could be used to stop
      vector-host contact.

TI  - Spatial distribution and molecular characterization of Anopheles nivipes and
      Anopheles philippinensis (Diptera: Culicidae) in north-east India.
PG  - 247-54
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.02.065 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles philippinensis-nivipes species of mosquitoes are considered secondary
      malaria vectors in the north-east India. However, difficulty in separating An.
      philippinensis and An. nivipes accurately on the basis of morphological
      identification, due to the overlapping female wing characters, has led to the
      paucity of information on their spatial distribution and vectorial importance,
      essential for understanding malaria disease epidemiology in areas under their
      influence. In view of this a study was undertaken to generate authentic
      information on distribution of An. philippinensis and An. nivipes in the
      north-east India using molecular tools. Between the two, An. nivipes was recorded
      as the dominant species in Assam, and Nagaland states whereas An. philippinensis 
      was found predominant in the state of Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. Species
      differentiation based on female wing characters proved wrong in about 74%
      specimens of An. philippinensis but found accurate in case of An. nivipes. No
      intra-specific variation in second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of
      ribosomal DNA(r-DNA) in either An. nivipes or An. philippinensis from different
      geographical areas of north-east India was noted.

AB  - In present study, the bioactivity of latex-producing plant Pergularia daemia as
      well as synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against the larval instars of
      Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi mosquito larvae was determined. The range
      of concentrations of plant latex (1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.25, and 31.25 ppm) and
      AgNPs (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, and 0.3125 ppm) were prepared. The LC(50) and
      LC(90) values for first, second, third, and fourth instars of synthesized
      AgNPs-treated first, second, third, and fourth instars of A. aegypti (LC(50) =
      4.39, 5.12, 5.66, 6.18; LC(90) = 9.90, 11.13, 12.40, 12.95 ppm) and A. stephensi 
      (LC(50) = 4.41, 5.35, 5.91, 6.47; LC(90) = 10.10, 12.04, 13.05, 14.08 ppm) were
      found many fold lower than crude latex-treated A. aegypti (LC(50) = 55.13, 58.81,
      75.66, 94.31; LC(90) = 113.00, 118.25, 156.95, 175.71 ppm) and A. stephensi
      (LC(50) = 81.47, 92.09, 96.07, 101.31; LC(90) = 159.51, 175.97, 180.67, 190.42
      ppm). The AgNPs did not exhibit any noticeable effects on Poecillia reticulata
      after either 24 or 48 h of exposure at their LC(50) and LC(90) values against
      fourth-instar larvae of A. aegypti and A. stephensi. The UV-visible analysis
      shows absorbance for AgNPs at 520 nm. TEM reveals spherical shape of synthesized 
      AgNPs. Particle size analysis revealed that the size of particles ranges from 44 
      to 255 nm with average size of 123.50 nm. AgNPs were clearly negatively charged
      (zeta potential -27.4 mV). This is the first report on mosquito larvicidal
      activity P. daemia-synthesized AgNPs.

TI  - Preliminary study on susceptibility status of Anopheles minimus Theobald and An. 
      fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) to DDT and deltamethrin in Keonjhar
      district of Odisha, India.
PG  - 25-8
AB  - This study was carried out to determine the susceptibility levels of An.
      fluviatilis and An. minimus to DDT (4%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) and to select
      the insecticide to be used for routine national malaria vector control programme 
      based on the results of the susceptibility test. Susceptibility test was done as 
      per standard WHO susceptibility tests using DDT(4%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) in
      the villages of Keonjhar Districts during 2009. The results indicate that An.
      fluviatilis showed 100% mortality to DDT (4%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) and An.
      minimus showed 96.2 per cent mortality to DDT (4%) and 100 per cent to
      deltamethrin (0.05%). An. fluviatilis and An. minimus have been incriminated as
      the major malaria vectors of Keonjhar district. Successful application of DDT and
      deltamethrin could reduce the vector load from this area with consequent malaria 
      control as these two species are found to be highly susceptible to DDT and
      deltamethrin. Another study as per WHO methodology is further recommended to
      substantiate the result of this study.

TI  - Wash resistance and efficacy of Olyset net and Permanet 2.0 against Anopheles
      stephensi in India.
PG  - 423-8
AB  - Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) have been developed for wash resistance and
      long-lasting effects against mosquito vectors. In this study we evaluated 2 LLIN 
      products, Olyset net and Permanet 2.0, washed for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 times,
      against Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria vector in India. We assessed the
      wash resistance and efficacy of these nets in relation to bloodfeeding inhibition
      and percent mortality in cone and tunnel test bioassays. Both Olyset and Permanet
      showed >80% mortality of An. stephensi in cone bioassays after 20 washes. In
      tunnel tests there was no significant difference between Olyset and Permanet 2.0 
      in causing total mosquito mortality (immediate and delayed) up to 10 washes and
      bloodfeeding inhibition and entry rate up to 15 washes. After the 20th wash,
      Permanet 2.0 was significantly more effective than the Olyset net in causing
      total mosquito mortality, whereas Olyset net showed less bloodfeeding and entry
      of mosquitoes as compared to Permanet 2.0. There was a gradual decline in
      efficacy of both LLIN products as the number of washings increased. Cone
      bioassays indicated a strong wash resistance in both the LLIN products after 20
      washes. However, the tunnel tests demonstrated a gradual decline in efficacy of
      both products with the number of washings.

TI  - Coffee husk waste for fermentation production of mosquitocidal bacteria.
PG  - 1816-23
AB  - Coffee husk waste (CHW) discarded as bio-organic waste, from coffee industries,
      is rich in carbohydrates. The current study emphasizes the management of solid
      waste from agro-industrial residues for the production of biopesticides (Bacillus
      sphaericus, and B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis), to control disease
      transmitting mosquito vectors. An experimental culture medium was prepared by
      extracting the filtrates from coffee husk. A conventional culture medium (NYSM)
      also was prepared. The studies revealed that the quantity of mosquitocidal toxins
      produced from CHW is at par with NYSM. The bacteria produced in these media, were
      bioassayed against mosquito vectors (Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi,
      and Aedes aegypti) and it was found that the toxic effect was statistically
      comparable. Cost-effective analysis have revealed that, production of
      biopesticides from CHW is highly economical. Therefore, the utilization of CHW
      provides dual benefits of effective utilization of environmental waste and
      efficient production of mosquitocidal toxins.

TI  - Geographical distribution and evaluation of mosquito larvivorous potential of
      Aphanius dispar (Ruppell), a native fish of Gujarat, India.
PG  - 236-40
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Certain indigenous fish can play potential role in
      vector control. The study recorded distribution of Aphanius dispar (Ruppell) in
      its native habitats in Gujarat, India and evaluated its larval propensity for
      Indian mosquito vectors. METHODS: Fishes were surveyed in various districts of
      Gujarat and samples were collected from coastal habitats and were identified to
      species. Physicochemical properties of water samples were analysed in the
      laboratory. Five laboratory acclimatized adult fish (2.2-3 cm) released in
      chlorine - free water in glass jars were provided with 500 larvae daily. Five
      replicates were run. Daily consumption of I to IV instars of Anopheles stephensi,
      Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus was recorded separately for three days. 
      Anopheles stephensi larval control using the fish in industrial tanks (9-180 m2 )
      was evaluated. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The fish was found in large numbers in
      estuarine waters, rivulets, backwaters and small dams in the districts of Kutch, 
      Jamnagar, Patan and Anand in Gujarat. Mean daily consumption of larvae in
      laboratory was as follows: An. stephensi 128 +/- 0.2 to 204 +/- 6; Cx.
      quinquefasciatus 24 +/- 4 to 58 +/- 10; Ae. aegypti 43 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 2. In
      water tanks, A. dispar reduced 93% larval counts by Day 7 and 98% by Day 21 (p
      <0.01), showing high larval propensity. A consolidated information on bionomics, 
      tolerance and physicochemical properties of water taken from natural habitats of 
      A. dispar indicate its high larvivorous potential. Large - scale evaluation is
      warranted to evaluate its potential in vector - borne disease control.

      Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) biomass in combination with the
      agro industrial by-product (coconut cake, CC) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) has 
      been evaluated. The biomass yield of Bti spore/crystal toxin was highest (12.06
      g/L) from the test medium (CF+CC+MnCl2) compared to the reference medium (Luria
      Bertani, LB). Toxicity assay with Bti produced from the test medium against
      mosquito vectors (Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti) 
      was also satisfactory and results were comparable with bacteria produced from LB.
      The results suggest that Bti can be produced to the maximum extent possible as a 
      potential mosquitocidal activity as suggested by the test medium (CF+CC+MnCl2).

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of the Citrus limetta peel extracts against Indian strains of
      Anopheles stephensi Liston and Aedes aegypti L.
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2814-5 [doi]
AB  - The extracts from the peels of Citrus limetta were prepared using hexane and
      petroleum ether as the solvents. The larvicidal potential of each extract was
      assessed against dengue fever vector, Aedes aegypti, and malarial vector,
      Anopheles stephensi, by evaluating the toxicity effects on early fourth instars. 
      Both the extracts were found effective against both the species. The bioassay
      with hexane extracts resulted in LC(50) values of 132.45 and 96.15 ppm against A.
      stephensi and A. aegypti, respectively; while the petroleum ether extracts from
      the C. limetta peels showed LC(50) values of 244.59 and 145.50 ppm, respectively.
      It revealed that the hexane extracts possessed 1.9-fold more larvicidal potential
      against A. stephensi and 1.5-fold more efficacy against A. aegypti as compared to
      the extracts obtained using petroleum ether as solvent. The data further revealed
      that the extracts were 1.4-1.7 times more effective against A. aegypti as
      compared to A. stephensi. The qualitative phytochemical study of the extracts
      showed the presence of terpenoids and flavonoids as the common phytochemical
      constituents in the extracts suggesting their possible role in the toxicity.
      Other constituents tested were not detected except alkaloids which were found to 
      be present only in the petroleum ether extract. Further studies are needed to
      isolate and identify the active principles involved, their mode of action,
      formulated preparations for enhancing potency and stability, toxicity, and
      effects on non-target organisms and the environment. This could help in
      formulating efficient strategies for mosquito control.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases with an economic impact create loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates. 
      Mosquito control is facing a threat because of the emergence of resistance to
      synthetic insecticides. Extracts from plants may be alternative sources of
      mosquito control agents because they constitute a rich source of bioactive
      compounds that are biodegradable into nontoxic products and potentially suitable 
      for use to control mosquitoes. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
      suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. In view of the recently
      increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to
      chemical insecticide, this study was undertaken to assess the larvicidal and
      ovicidal potential of the crude hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and
      methanol solvent extracts from the medicinal plant Delonix elata against the
      medically important mosquito vectors, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti
      (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure.
      All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval
      mortality was found in methanol extract of leaf of D. elata against the larvae of
      A. stephensi and A. aegypti with the LC(50) and LC(90) values being 93.59 and
      111.83, and 163.69 and 202.77 ppm, respectively. Compared to leaf extracts, seeds
      have low potency against two mosquitoes with the LC(50) and LC(90) values being
      115.28 and 139.04, and 225.07 and 273.03 ppm, respectively. The mean percent
      hatchability of the eggs was observed after 48 h post-treatment. The percent
      hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and
      directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed moderate 
      ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract showed the highest ovicidal
      activity. One hundred percent mortality was observed at 300 ppm for leaf methanol
      extract and 500 ppm for seed methanol extract of D. elata against A. stephensi
      and A. aegypti, respectively. These results suggest that the leaf and seed
      extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the
      control of mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal and
      ovicidal activities of the reported D. elata plant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles annularis s.l. is a wide spread malaria vector in South and
      Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka. The taxon An. annularis is a complex of two 
      sibling species viz. A and B, that are differentiated by chromosome banding
      patterns and ribosomal gene sequences in India. Only species A is reported to be 
      a malaria vector in India while the occurrence of sibling species in Sri Lanka
      has not been documented previously. FINDINGS: Anopheline larvae were collected at
      a site in the Jaffna district, which lies within the dry zone of Sri Lanka, and
      reared in the laboratory. Emerged adults were identified using standard keys. DNA
      sequences of the D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the internal
      transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) of the morphologically identified An. annularis were
      determined. BLASTn searches against corresponding An. annularis sequences in
      GenBank and construction of phylogenetic trees from D3 and ITS-2 rDNA sequences
      showed that the Sri Lankan specimens, and An. annularis s.l. specimens from
      several Southeast Asian countries were closely related to species A of the Indian
      An. annularis complex. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the presence of the malaria 
      vector An. annularis species A in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Because An.
      annularis vectors have been long associated with malaria transmission in
      irrigated agricultural areas in the Sri Lankan dry zone, continued monitoring of 
      An. annularis populations, and their sibling species status, in these areas need 
      to be integral to malaria control and eradication efforts in the island.

AB  - The effect of alpha-amyrin acetate on mortality and blood feeding behavior in
      females of Anopheles stephensi was assessed by in vivo exposure on treated guinea
      pig skin. In vivo exposure to alpha-amyrin acetate caused mosquito knock down in 
      the form of rapidly and normally reversible paralysis and the subsequent record
      at the end of a 24 h, revealed mortality rates of females increased from 0.0%
      (Control) to 76.9% at 1.6% alpha-amyrin acetate, the highest concentration which 
      implies the contact toxicity of the alpha-amyrin acetate received through the
      sensitive parts of test species. The mean probing time responses significantly
      increased (P < 0.05) from 5.3 s (Control) to 22.9 s at 1.6% alpha-amyrin acetate.
      The blood feeding rates and the mean engorgement times were significantly shorter
      when compared to the control. The mean blood feeding rates of exposed females
      decreased from 91.7% (control) to 41.5% at 0.8% alpha-amyrin acetate
      concentrations, the mean engorgement time also decreased from 278.6 s (Control)
      to 158.7 s at 0.8% alpha-amyrin acetate concentrations. Mean blood feeding rates 
      and mean engorgement time were statistically significant (P < 0.05) from that of 
      control. The mean fecundity levels significantly reduced from 96.2 (Control) to
      65.95%. The shortened mean engorgement time and smaller blood meal size have
      played a more important role in decline of fecundity. In vivo exposure to
      alpha-amyrin acetate caused increased mean probing time, decreased blood
      engorgement time and feeding rate and declined fecundity which reduce the overall
      survival and reproductive capacity of the malaria vector A. stephensi.

TI  - Malaria in India: the center for the study of complex malaria in India.
PG  - 267-73
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.11.008 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in India and one which contributes
      significantly to the overall malaria burden in Southeast Asia. The National
      Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India reported approximately 1.6 million 
      cases and approximately 1100 malaria deaths in 2009. Some experts argue that this
      is a serious underestimation and that the actual number of malaria cases per year
      is likely between 9 and 50 times greater, with an approximate 13-fold
      underestimation of malaria-related mortality. The difficulty in making these
      estimations is further exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria
      eco-epidemiological profiles, (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple
      Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug
      resistance and insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on
      each of these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is
      complex. Here we describe plans for a Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in 
      India (CSCMi), one of ten International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research
      (ICEMRs) located in malarious regions of the world recently funded by the
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of
      Health. The CSCMi is a close partnership between Indian and United States
      scientists, and aims to address major gaps in our understanding of the complexity
      of malaria in India, including changing patterns of epidemiology, vector biology 
      and control, drug resistance, and parasite genomics. We hope that such a
      multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical and field studies with
      laboratory, molecular, and genomic methods will provide a powerful combination
      for malaria control and prevention in India.

TI  - Chemical composition and larvicidal activity of essential oil from Mentha spicata
      (Linn.) against three mosquito species.

AB  - Mosquitoes are blood-feeding insects and serve as the most important vectors for 
      spreading human diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and
      filariasis. The continued use of synthetic insecticides has resulted in
      resistance in mosquitoes. Synthetic insecticides are toxic and affect the
      environment by contaminating soil, water, and air, and then natural products may 
      be an alternative to synthetic insecticides because they are effective,
      biodegradable, eco-friendly, and safe to environment. Botanical origin may serve 
      as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. Mentha spicata, an
      edible and medicinal plant, is chiefly distributed in Southeast Asia and South
      Asia. In the present study, the toxicity of mosquito larvicidal activity of leaf 
      essential oil (EO) and their major chemical constituents from Mentha spicata
      against Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi. The
      chemical composition of the leaf EO was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectroscopy (GC-MS). GC-MS revealed that the EO of M. spicata contained 18
      compounds. The major chemical components identified were carvone (48.60%),
      cis-carveol (21.30%), and limonene (11.30%). The EO had a significant toxic
      effect against early third-stage larvae of C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, and
      A. stephensi with LC(50) values of 62.62, 56.08, and 49.71 ppm and LC(90) values 
      of 118.70, 110.28, and 100.99 ppm, respectively. The three major pure
      constituents extracted from the M. spicata leaf EO were also tested individually 
      against three mosquito larvae. The LC(50) values of carvone, cis-carveol, and
      limonene appeared to be most effective against A. stephensi (LC(50) 19.33, 28.50,
      and 8.83 ppm) followed by A. aegypti (LC(50) 23.69, 32.88, and 12.01 ppm), and C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) 25.47, 35.20, and 14.07 ppm). The results could be
      useful in search for newer, safer, and more effective natural larvicidal agents
      against C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, and A. stephensi.

TI  - Mosquito larvicidal properties of aqueous and acetone extracts of Trianthema
      portulacastrum Linn. (family: Aizoaceae) against vector species of mosquitoes.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - Crude aqueous and acetone extracts of leaf of Trianthema portulacastrum was
      evaluated for its mosquito larvicidal properties against the larvae of four
      vector species of mosquito under laboratory conditions. These extracts showed
      good larvicidal properties, 100% mortality in the third instar larvae was
      observed in the larval bioassay test with Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles
      stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti at a concentration of 1.0,
      0.75, 0.75 and 1.0% respectively. The LD50 values estimated for aqueous extract
      against the larvae of An. culicifacies, An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and
      Ae. aegypti were 0.17, 0.15, 0.18 and 0.17% and LD90 values were 0.57, 0.58,
      0.76, and 0.75% respectively. The LD50 values estimated for acetone extract
      against the larvae of An. culicifacies, An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and
      Ae. aegypti were 0.09, 0.10, 0.09 and 0.12 % and LD90 values were 0.28, 0.25,
      0.26 and 0.26% respectively. It is observed that the acetone extract is more
      effective as compared to aqueous extract. Trianthema portulacastrum can be
      considered as a probable source of photochemical used for the development of
      larvicide against disease vectors.

PG  - 948-51
LID - 10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60224-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the larvicidal and egg hatching inhibition property of the
      leaf essential oil of Coccinia indica (C. indica) against Anopheles stephensi
      (An. stephensi). METHODS: The larvicidal potential of C. indica leaf essential
      oil was evaluated against 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instars larvae of An. stephensi
      using WHO protocol. The 24h LC(50) and LC(90) values of the essential oil were
      determined following probit analysis. The egg hatching inhibition activity was
      also tested at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/L. The IC(50) value of essential oil was
      determined against eggs of An. stephensi. RESULTS: The essential oil extracted
      from C. indica possessed excellent larvicidal and egg hatching inhibition
      activity against An. stephensi. The bioassays showed LC(50)-LC(90) of 54.3-140.3,
      65.5-155.6, 86.8-180.7 and 95.3-192.6 for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th larval instars, 
      respectively. The 50% egg hatching inhibition concentration (IC(50)) was noted at
      16.5 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The present finding suggest that the C. indica leaf
      essential oil provided an excellent potential for controlling An. stephensi
      mosquito at earlier stage of their life cycle.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the adulticidal and repellent activities of different
      solvent leaf extracts of Eclipta alba (E. alba) and Andrographis paniculata (A.
      paniculata) against malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi).
      METHODS: Adulticidal efficacy of the crude leaf extracts of E. alba and A.
      paniculata with five different solvents like benzene, hexane, ethyl acetate,
      methanol and chloroform was tested against the five to six day old adult female
      mosquitoes of An. stephensi. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h under
      the laboratory conditions. The repellent efficacy was determined against An.
      stephensi mosquito species at three concentrations viz., 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0
      mg/cm(2) under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Among the tested solvents the
      maximum efficacy was observed in the methanol extract. The LC(50) and LC(90)
      values of E. alba and A. paniculata against adults of An. stephensi were 150.36, 
      130.19 ppm and 285.22, 244.16 ppm, respectively. No mortality was observed in
      controls. The chi-square values were significant at P<0.05 level. Methanol
      extract of E. alba and A. paniculata was produce maximum repellency against An.
      stephensi. CONCLUSIONS: From the results it can be concluded the crude extract of
      E. alba and A. paniculata was an excellent potential for controlling An.
      stephensi mosquitoes.

TI  - Enhanced production of mosquitocidal cyclic lipopeptide from Bacillus subtilis
      subsp. subtilis.
PG  - 476-82
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A cyclic lipopeptide, surfactin produced by a strain of 
      Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis (VCRC B471) was found to exhibit activity
      against both the larval and pupal stages of mosquitoes. The present study was
      aimed at increasing the production of the mosquitocidal metabolite by modifying
      the conventional medium. METHODS: Enhancement of mosquitocidal metabolite
      production was attempted by replacing the existing micronutrients of the
      conventional NYSM and supplementing the medium with additional amounts of
      glucose. The LC(5)(0) value of culture supernatant (CS) against the larval and
      pupal stages of Anopheles stephensi was determined. Crude mosquitocidal
      metabolite (CMM) was separated from the CS, identified by MALDI-TOF analysis and 
      its LC(5)(0) dosage requirement for the pupal stage of the above mosquito species
      determined. RESULTS: The medium containing a new composition of micronutrients
      and glucose up to 1 per cent resulted in increased metabolite production. The
      LC(5)(0) value of the CS obtained in the improved medium against larvae and pupae
      of An. stephensi was 5.57 and 0.71 mul/ml, respectively. The yield of CMM was
      doubled in the improved medium. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that the CMM was
      surfactin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The new improved medium enhanced the
      production of mosquitocidal metabolite as the dosage required for inciting 50 per
      cent mortality among the pupal stages of mosquitoes was only half of that
      required when the metabolite was produced in the conventional medium. The
      mosquitocidal metabolite was identified as surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide and
      biosurfactant.

AB  - In the present study activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using
      Plumeria rubra plant latex against second and fourth larval instar of Aedes
      aegypti and Anopheles stephensi was determined. Range of concentrations of
      synthesized AgNps (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125 ppm) and aqueous crude latex
      (1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.50, 31.25 ppm) were tested against larvae of A. aegypti
      and A. Stephensi. The synthesized AgNps from P. rubra latex were highly toxic
      than crude latex extract in both mosquito species. The LC(50) values for second
      and fourth larval instars after 24 h of crude latex exposure were 1.49, 1.82 ppm 
      against A. aegypti and 1.10, 1.74 ppm against A. stephensi respectively. These
      figures were 181.67, 287.49 ppm against A. aegypti and 143.69, 170.58 ppm against
      A. stephensi respectively for crude latex extract. The mortality rates were
      positively correlated with the concentration of AgNPs. The characterization
      studies of synthesized AgNPs by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, transmission electron
      microscopy (TEM), Particle size analysis (PSA) and zeta potential confirmed the
      spherical shape and size (32-200 nm) of silver nanoparticles along with
      stability. Toxicity studies carried out against non-target fish species Poecilia 
      reticulata, the most common organism in the habitats of A. aegypti and A.
      stephensi showed no toxicity at LC(50) and LC(90) doses of the AgNPs. This is the
      first report on mosquito larvicidal activity of latex synthesized nanoparticles.

AB  - The tremendous worldwide efforts to isolate novel mosquito larvicidal bacteria
      with improved efficacy present significant promise to control vector-borne
      diseases of public health importance. In the present study, two native bacterial 
      isolates, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt SV2) and Serratia species (SV6) were
      evaluated for mosquito larvicidal potential against the early fourth instar
      larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus with
      reference to B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) H 14. The native
      Gram-positive, spore-forming Bt SV2 isolate showed 100% mortality against early
      fourth instars of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus,
      in parallel to Bti H14 strain. After 24 h, Bt SV2 showed 98%, 89%, and 80.67%,
      and Bti H14 showed 92%, 98.33%, and 60% mortality against Aedes aegypti,
      Anopheles stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus, respectively. Serratia SV6
      showed highest activity against Culex quinquefasciatus (100%) followed by
      Anopheles stephensi (95%) and Aedes aegypti (91%) after 48 h of exposure. The
      Gram-negative Serratia SV6 showed delayed toxicity compared to Bti H14 and Bt SV2
      against early fourth instars of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. The relative mortality of all treatments after 12-h exposures
      showed the varied toxicity with respect to exposure time, bacterial treatment,
      and mosquito species. Genetic relatedness of the strains was confirmed on the
      basis of phylogenetic reconstructions based on alignment of 16S rRNA gene
      sequences which indicated a strong clustering of the strain SV2 with B.
      thuringiensis and the strain SV6 with Serratia nematodiphila. In conclusion, the 
      native isolate B. thuringiensis SV2 showed significant toxicity while Serratia
      SV6 showed less and delayed toxicity against several mosquito species compared
      with BtiH14. They may be used as novel bacterial insecticidal agents in mosquito 
      vector-borne disease control. To our knowledge, this is the first report on
      mosquito larvicidal potential of Serratia species.

TI  - Toxicological properties of several medicinal plants from the Himalayas (India)
      against vectors of malaria, filariasis and dengue.

AB  - The leaves of five plants namely Nyctanthes arbortistis (Oleaceae), Catharanthus 
      roseus (Apocynaceae), Boenininghusenia albiflora (Rutaceae), Valeriana hardwickii
      (Valerianaceae) and Eupatorium odoratum (Asteraceae) were selected for the first 
      time from the Garhwal region of north west Himalaya to investigation its
      toxicological properties against mosquito vectors of malaria, filariasis and
      dengue. In a laboratory study, using different polarity solvents (petroleum
      ether, chloroform and methanol) were tested against important larvae of malaria, 
      filariasis and dengue vectors in India. It was observed that petroleum ether
      fraction of all selected plant possess good larvicidal properties than other
      solvent fraction. The LC(50) values of isolates from Nyctanthes arbortistis
      (HAR-1), C. roseus (CAT-1), B. albiflora (BOA-1), V. hardwickii (SUG-1) and E.
      odoratum (EUP-1) against Anopheles stephensi were 185 ppm, 150 ppm, 105 ppm, 225 
      ppm and 135 ppm, respectively. The results therefore suggest that the fraction
      code BOA-1 has excellent larvicidal properties and could be incorporated as
      botanical insecticides against mosquito vectors with high safety to nontarget
      organisms. The same fraction was tested against adult vectors of malaria,
      filariasis and dengue, but no mortality was observed.

AB  - A biological method was used to synthesize stable silver nanoparticles that were 
      tested as mosquito larvicides against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus. Annona squamosa leaf broth (5%) reduced aqueous 1 mM
      AgNO(3) to stable silver nanoparticles with an average size of 450 nm. The
      structure and percentage of synthesized nanoparticles was characterized by using 
      ultraviolet spectrophotometry, X-Ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy methods. The median lethal
      concentrations (LC(5)(0)) of silver nanoparticles that killed fourth instars of
      Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and An. stephensi were 0.30, 0.41, and 2.12
      ppm, respectively. Adult longevity (days) in male and female mosquitoes exposed
      as larvae to 0.1 ppm silver nanoparticles was reduced by ~30% (p<0.05), whereas
      the number of eggs laid by females exposed as larvae to 0.1 ppm silver
      nanoparticles decreased by 36% (p<0.05).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the larvicidal and repellent activities of Coccinia (C)
      indica Wight and Arnold (Family:Cucurbitaceae) extract against Culex (Cx.)
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Anopheles (An.) stephensi. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The ovicidal activity was determined against three mosquito species 
      to various concentrations ranging from 50-300 ppm under the laboratory
      conditions. The hatch rates were assessed 48 h post treatment. The repellent
      efficacy was determined against three mosquito species at three concentrations
      viz., 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/cm2 under the laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Among
      five solvent extracts tested, the methanol extract have most promising ovicidal
      activity. The methanol extract exerted zero hatchability (100% mortality) at 150 
      ppm for Cx. quinquefasciatus, at 200 ppm for Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi. The
      methanol extract of C. indica found to be more repellency than the other
      extracts. A higher concentration of 5.0 mg/cm2 provided 100% protection up to 270
      min against Cx. quinquefasciatus and 210 min against Ae. aegypti and An.
      stephensi, respectively. The results clearly show that repellent activity was
      dose dependent. CONCLUSIONS: From the results it can be concluded the crude
      extract of C. indica was an excellent potential for controlling Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi mosquitoes.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the larvicidal property of marine
      actinobacterial compound 5-(2,4-dimethylbenzyl) pyrrolidin-2-one (DMBPO)
      extracted and isolated from Streptomyces VITSVK5 sp. tested against the larvae of
      Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus Canestrini (Acari: Ixodidae), Anopheles
      stephensi Liston, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae). The
      isolate bacteria was taxonomically characterized, identified, and designated as
      Streptomyces VITSVK5 sp. The crude extract was loaded on silica gel column and
      eluted with chloroform:methanol. The isolated pure compound was analyzed by thin 
      layer chromatography using chloroform and methanol as the solvent system and
      confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the
      purified compound was established from infrared, ultraviolet, (1)H-nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR), (13)C-NMR, and mass spectral data. The chemical shift
      assignments obtained for the aliphatic compound from (1)H-NMR corresponding to
      the molecular formula C(13)H(17)NO. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the
      isolation of compound which was identified as DMBPO. In the present study,
      Streptomyces VITSVK5 sp. crude extract and different fractions were tested
      against the larvae of parasites at the concentration of 1,000 ppm. Those
      fractions showing 100% mortality in 24 h alone was selected for further column
      chromatographic separation. The purified compound, C(13)H(17)NO, was tested in
      the concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 ppm and observed the percent
      larval mortality of 100, 70, 64, 40, and 28 against R. microplus; 100, 79, 63,
      36, and 22 against A. stephensi; and 100, 84, 67, 42, and 27 against C.
      tritaeniorhynchus, respectively. The crude extract showed parasitic effects after
      24 h of exposure at 1,000 ppm, and parasite mortality was observed against the
      larvae of R. microplus (LC(50) = 210.39 ppm, r (2) = 0.873); A. stephensi (LC(50)
      = 169.38 ppm, r (2) = 0.840); and C. tritaeniorhynchus (LC(50) = 198.75 ppm, r
      (2) = 0.887). The maximum efficacy was observed in purified marine
      actinobacterial compound DMBPO with LC(50) and r (2) values against the larvae of
      R. microplus (84.31 ppm, 0.889); A. stephensi (88.97 ppm, 0.817), and C.
      tritaeniorhynchus (74.95 ppm, 0.781), respectively. The control (distilled water)
      showed nil mortality in the concurrent assay.

TI  - Acaricidal, insecticidal, and larvicidal efficacy of fruit peel aqueous extract
      of Annona squamosa and its compounds against blood-feeding parasites.
PG  - 2189-99

AB  - Plant products may be alternative sources of parasitic control agents, since they
      constitute a rich source of bioactive compounds that are eco-friendly and
      nontoxic products. The plant extracts are good and safe alternatives due to their
      low toxicity to mammals and easy biodegradability. In the present study, fruit
      peel aqueous extract of Annona squamosa (Annonaceae) extracted by immersion
      method exhibited adulticidal activity against Haemaphysalis bispinosa (Acarina:
      Ixodidae) and the hematophagous fly, Hippobosca maculata (Diptera:
      Hippoboscidae), and larvicidal activity against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus
      (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), Anopheles subpictus, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The chemical composition of A. squamosa
      fruit peel aqueous extract was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
      The major chemical constituent of peel aqueous extract of A. squamosa was
      identified as 1H- cycloprop[e]azulen-7-ol
      decahydro-1,1,7-trimethyl-4-methylene-[1ar-(1aalpha,4aalpha, 7beta, 7 a, beta,
      7balpha)] (28.55%) by comparison of mass spectral data and retention times. The
      other major constituents present in the aqueous extract were retinal 9-cis-
      (12.61%), 3,17-dioxo-4-androsten-11alpha-yl hydrogen succinate (6.86%),
      1-naphthalenepentanol
      decahydro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-y,2-bis(methylene)-(1alpha,4abeta,5alph
      a,8aalpha) (14.83%), 1-naphthalenemethanol decahydro
      -5-(5-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-pentenyl)- 1,4a-di methyl - 6-methylene -(1S-[1alpha,
      4aalpha, 5alpha(E), 8abeta] (4.44%), (-)-spathulenol (20.75%),
      podocarp-7-en-3-one13beta-methyl-13-vinyl- (5.98%), and 1-phenanthrene
      carboxaldehyde
      7-ethenyl-1,2,3,4,4a,4,5,6,7,9,10,10a-dodecahydro-1,4a,7-trimethyl-[1R-(1alpha,4a
      beta.4balpha,7beta, 10aalpha)]-(5.98%). The adult and larval parasitic
      mortalities observed in fruit peel aqueous extract of A. squamosa were 31, 59,
      80, 91, and100%; 27, 42, 66, 87, and 100%; and 33, 45, 68, 92, and 100% at the
      concentrations of 250, 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 ppm, respectively, against
      Haemaphysalis bispinosa, Hippobosca maculata, and R. microplus. The observed
      larvicidal efficacies were 36, 55, 72, 92, 100% and 14, 34, 68, 89, and 100% at
      200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 ppm, respectively, against A. subpictus and C.
      quinquefasciatus. The highest parasite mortality was found after 24 h of exposure
      against Haemaphysalis bispinosa (LC(50) = 404.51 ppm, r (2) = 0.890), Hippobosca 
      maculata (LC(50) = 600.75 ppm, r (2) = 0.983), the larvae of R. microplus (LC(50)
      = 548.28 ppm, r (2) = 0.975), fourth-instar larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) =
      327.27 pm, r (2) = 0.970), and C. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 456.29 ppm, r (2) = 
      0.974), respectively. The control (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the
      concurrent assay. The chi (2) values were significant at p < 0.05 level.
      Therefore, the eco-friendly and biodegradable compounds from fruit peel aqueous
      extract of A. squamosa may be an alternative to conventional synthetic chemicals,
      particularly in integrated approach for the control of Haemaphysalis bispinosa,
      Hippobosca maculata, R. microplus, and the medically important vectors A.
      subpictus and C. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Efficacy of indigenous plant extracts on the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus
      Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 375-83
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mosquito control is facing a threat due to the emergence
      of resistance to synthetic insecticides. Insecticides of plant origin may serve
      as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The purpose of the
      present study was to assess the ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extracts of
      Andrographis paniculata, Eclipta prostrata and Tagetes erecta leaves tested for
      oviposition-deterrent, ovicidal and repellent activities against malaria vector, 
      Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae). METHODS: The dried leaves of the
      three plants were powdered mechanically and extracted with ethyl acetate, acetone
      and methanol. One gram of crude extract was first dissolved in 100 ml of acetone 
      (stock solution). From the stock solution, test solution concentrations of 31.21-
      499.42 mg/l for oviposition- deterrence assay and repellency and 15.60 - 998.85
      mg/l were used in ovicidal assay. The percentage oviposition- deterrence,
      hatching rate of eggs and protection time were calculated. One-way analysis of
      variance was used for the multiple concentration tests and for per cent mortality
      to determine significant treatment differences. RESULTS: The percentage of
      effective oviposition repellency was highest at 499.42 mg/l and the lowest at
      31.21 mg/l in ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extracts of A. paniculata, E.
      prostrata and T. erecta. The oviposition activity index (OAI) value of ethyl
      acetate, acetone and methanol extracts of A. paniculata, E. prostrata and T.
      erecta at 499.42 mg/l were -0.91, -0.93, -0.84, -0.84, -0.87, -0.82, -0.87, -0.89
      and -0.87, respectively. Mortality (no egg hatchability) was 100 per cent with
      ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of A. paniculata, E. prostrata and T. erecta 
      at 998.85 mg/l. The maximum adult repellent activity was observed at 499.42 mg/l 
      in ethyl acetate extracts of A. paniculata, E. prostrata and methanol extracts of
      T. erecta, and the mean complete protection time ranged from 120 to 150 min with 
      the different extracts tested. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The acetone extract 
      of A. paniculata, methanol extract of E. prostrata and T. erecta showed good
      oviposition-deterrent, ovicidal and repellent activities respectively. These
      results suggest that the leaf extracts of A. paniculata, E. prostrata and T.
      erecta may have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for
      the control of the An. subpictus.

PG  - 698-705
LID - 10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60177-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the larvicidal and repellent activities of ethyl acetate
      and methanol extracts of Acacia concinna (A. concinna), Cassia siamea (C.
      siamea), Coriandrum sativum (C. sativum),Cuminum cyminum (C. cyminum), Lantana
      camara (L. camara), Nelumbo nucifera (N. nucifera) Phyllanthus amarus (P.
      amarus), Piper nigrum (P. nigrum) and Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) against
      Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx.
      quinquefasciatus). METHODS: The larvicidal activity of medicinal plant extracts
      were tested against early fourth-instar larvae of malaria and filariasis vectors.
      The mortality was observed 24 h and 48 h after treatment, data were subjected to 
      probit analysis to determine the lethal concentrations (LC(50) and LC(90)) to
      kill 50 and 90 per cent of the treated larvae of the tested species. The
      repellent efficacy was determined against two mosquito species at five
      concentrations (31.25, 62.50, 125.00, 250.00, and 500.00 ppm) under the
      laboratory conditions. RESULTS: All plant extracts showed moderate effects after 
      24 h and 48 h of exposure; however, the highest activity was observed after 24 h 
      in the leaf methanol extract of N. nucifera, seed ethyl acetate and methanol
      extract of P. nigrum against the larvae of An. stephensi (LC(50) = 34.76, 24.54
      and 30.20 ppm) and against Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 37.49, 43.94 and 57.39 
      ppm), respectively. The toxic effect of leaf methanol extract of C. siamea, seed 
      methanol extract of C. cyminum, leaf ethyl acetate extract of N. nucifera, leaf
      ethyl acetate and methanol extract of P. amarus and seed methanol extract of T.
      ammi were showed 100% mortality against An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus
      after 48 h exposer. The maximum repellent activity was observed at 500 ppm in
      methanol extracts of N. nucifera, ethyl acetate and methanol extract of P. nigrum
      and methanol extract of T. ammi and the mean complete protection time ranged from
      30 to 150 min with the different extracts tested. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that the leaf and seed extracts of C. siamea, N. nucifera, P. amarus, P. 
      nigrum and T. ammi have the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach
      for the control of the An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus.

AB  - Mosquito larviciding may prove to be an effective tool for incorporating into
      integrated vector management strategies for reducing malaria transmission. Here, 
      we report the potential of potash alum, a traditionally known salt in Indian
      Ayurveda and Chinese medicine system, in malaria vector control by evaluating its
      aqueous suspension as larvicide and growth disruptor of Anopheles stephensi,
      under laboratory conditions. Immature stages of the mosquito were tested using
      WHO guidelines. 50 and 90% lethal concentrations among various larvae ranged
      between 2.1 to 48.74 ppm and 15.78 to 93.11 ppm, respectively. The results
      indicated that larvicidal effects of potash alum were comparable to various
      biological and chemical insecticides. The study provides considerable scope in
      exploiting local indigenous resources for the control of nuisance mosquito
      vectors.

AB  - Ethanolic extracts of Cynodon dactylon, Aloe vera, Hemidesmus indicus and Coleus 
      amboinicus were tested for their toxicity effect on the third-instar larvae of
      Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. The leaves of C.
      dactylon, A. vera, H. indicus and C. amboinicus were collected from natural
      habitats (forests) in Western Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 250 g of
      fresh, mature leaves were rinsed with distilled water and dried in shade. The
      dried leaves were put in Soxhlet apparatus and extract prepared using 100%
      ethanol for 72 h at 30-40 degrees C. Dried residues were obtained from 100 g of
      extract evaporated to dryness in rotary vacuum evaporator. Larvicidal properties 
      of ethanolic leaf extracts showed that the extracts are effective as mosquito
      control agents. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. No
      mortality was observed in the control. The median lethal concentration (LC(50))
      values observed for the larvicidal activities are 0.44%, 0.51%, 0.59% and 0.68%
      for extracts of C. dactylon, A. vera, H. indicus and C. amboinicus, respectively.
      The observed mortality were statistically significant at P < 0.05 level. C.
      dactylon showed the highest mortality rate against the three species of mosquito 
      larvae in laboratory and field. The selected plants were shown to exhibit water
      purification properties. Water quality parameters such as turbidity, pH and water
      clarity were analyzed in the water samples (pre-treatment and post-treatment of
      plant extracts) taken from the different breeding sites of mosquitoes. Water
      colour, turbidity and pH were reduced significantly after treatment with C.
      dactylon (13 HU, 31.5 mg/l and 6.9), H. indicus (13.8 HU, 33 mg/l and 7.1), A.
      vera (16 HU, 33.8 mg/l and 7.4) and C. amboinicus (21 HU, 35 mg/l and 7.5)
      extracts. The study proved that the extracts of C. dactylon, A. vera, H. indicus 
      and C. amboinicus have both mosquitocidal and water sedimentation properties.

TI  - Evaluation of the impact of ZeroFly(R), an insecticide incorporated plastic
      sheeting on malaria incidence in two temporary labour shelters in India.
PG  - 138-43
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Prevention of malaria is a major technical and
      operational problem in displaced and mobile populations such as refugee camps and
      temporary labour settlements. Insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting is a new 
      technology to control mosquitoes in emergency shelters and also temporary
      habitations at different locations. In view of this, efficacy of ZeroFly(R) , an 
      insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting (factory treated with deltamethrin 2.0 
      g/kg or 265 mg/m2 ) was evaluated for its efficacy against malaria vectors and
      its impact on malaria incidence in temporary labour settlements in two urban
      areas in India. METHODS: This trial was conducted in two labour settlements in
      two urban areas, Delhi and Noida (U.P.), India with ~ 250 populations. In an
      area, two localities were selected for intervention with ZeroFly and untreated
      plastic sheets (control). Entomological and epidemiological data were collected
      using standard methods for one year. RESULTS: Baseline studies on the
      susceptibility of mosquitoes in Delhi and Noida areas revealed 100%
      susceptibility of the malaria vector species Anopheles culicifacies and An.
      stephensi to deltamethrin. Cone bioassay tests performed against An. culicifacies
      and An. stephensi to determine the efficacy of ZeroFly sheets showed 100%
      mortality against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi with 3 min exposure and
      after 24 h recovery period. Against Culex quinquefasciatus and housefly 100%
      mortality was obtained after 30 min of exposure period. Intervention with the
      ZeroFly plastic sheets resulted in almost complete reduction in the resting
      density of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi, the two major malaria vectors and 
      also in the reduction of malaria cases in ZeroFly camps as compared to control
      camps. The ZeroFly plastic sheeting was found to be safe for human. Barring some 
      complaints of skin irritation and itching, which were temporary in nature, no
      adverse health effects were reported by the users. The community acceptance was
      high. CONCLUSION: Results of the present study revealed that ZeroFly(R) plastic
      sheeting is highly effective in reducing the indoor resting density of
      mosquitoes, man -vector contact and malaria incidences in labour populations
      living in temporary shelters.

TI  - Spinosad and neem seed kernel extract as bio-controlling agents for malarial
      vector, Anopheles stephensi and non-biting midge, Chironomus circumdatus.
PG  - 614-8
LID - 10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60158-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Midge egg masses are reported to support non-pathogenic strains of the
      cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholera (V. cholera). Mosquito born diseases have been
      reported to cause millions of death worldwide. The present research reveals the
      toxicity effect of spinosad and neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) against different
      larval stages of Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) and Chironomus circumdatus
      (Ch. circumdatus). METHODS: The neem seeds were collected from Marudamalai hills,
      Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India. Neem seed kernels were powdered,
      extracted and diluted for different concentrations (2 ppm to 10 ppm). Spinosad
      was purchased from Kalpatharu pesticide Limited, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India
      and thoroughly mixed with distilled water to prepare various concentrations (0.01
      to 0.08 ppm) and used for bioassay. RESULTS: The results depict that spinosad is 
      more toxic in lower concentrations when compared to NSKE and mosquitoes are more 
      susceptible than chironomids. Lethal concentrations were evaluated using the
      observed mortality. The lowest LC(50) value obtained from spinosad against An.
      stephensi and Ch. circumdatus were 0.002 05 ppm and 0.008 91 ppm. This study
      investigated on effect of Spinosad and NSKE on the biology of mosquito. The
      immature stages of both species were susceptible to Spinosad and NSKE. Spinosad
      and NSKE in individual as well as combined treatment provided additional days in 
      development for mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS: The results conclude that Spinosad and
      NSKE are potential larvicides against An. stephensi and Ch. circumdatus.

TI  - Comparative larvicidal potential of different plant parts of Withania somnifera
      against vector mosquitoes in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Larvicidal potential of the extracts from different parts viz. green and red
      fruits, seeds, fruit without seeds, leaves and roots of Withania somnifera in
      different solvents was evaluated against larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes
      aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, the important disease vectors prevalent in
      the semi-arid region. Experiments were carried out on late 3rd or early 4th
      instar larvae of these mosquitoes using standard WHO technique. 24 and 48 hr LC50
      values along with their 95% confidence limits, regression equation, chi-square
      (chi2)/heterogeneity of the response have been determined by log probit
      regression analysis. The 24 hr LC50 values as observed for whole green fruits in 
      water, methanol and petroleum ether were 350.9, 372.4, 576.9; 115.0, 197.1,
      554.6; 154.9, 312.0, 1085.0 while corresponding values for red fruits were 473.5,
      406.4,445.2; 94.7, 94.5, 1013.0; 241.8, 535.0, 893.3 mg l(-1) for An. stephensi, 
      Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus respectively showing that methanol extracts 
      were more effective against anophelines as compared to culicines when whole
      fruits were taken. The 24 hr LC50 values as observed for seeds in acetone,
      methanol and petroleum ether were 188.1, 777.5, 822.5; 245.5, 769.0, 1169.0;
      140.3, 822.9, 778.4 and for fruit without seeds were 80.2, 97.6, 146.6; 88.4,
      404.4, 1030.0; 30.0, 44.5, 54.2 mg l(-1) for the above mosquito species
      respectively showing that extract of fruit without seeds were most effective in
      petroleum ether followed by acetone and methanol extracts. However, experiments
      conducted with methanol extracts of leaves and roots of this plant species did
      not show any appreciable larvicidal activity and a 20-40% mortality was observed 
      up to 500 mg l(-1) of the extracts. Overall larvae of anophelines were found more
      susceptible as compared to culicines to all the extracts tested. Petroleum ether 
      extract of fruit without seeds was found most effective against all the mosquito 
      species showing that active ingredient might be present in this part of the plant
      species. The study would be of great importance while planning vector control
      strategy based on alternative plant derived insecticides.

PG  - 1833-40
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the adulticidal and larvicidal
      activity of dried leaf hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol extracts of
      Nelumbo nucifera, Manilkara zapota, Ipomoea staphylina, and Acalypha indica

      fly Hippobosca maculata (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), and fourth instar larvae of
      malaria vector Anopheles subpictus (Diptera: Culicidae). Parasites were exposed
      to varying concentrations of plant extracts for 24 h. All extracts showed
      moderate parasitic effects; however, the percent parasitic mortality observed in 
      the crude leaf hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol extracts of N.
      nucifera and M. zapota against H. bispinosa were 80, 74, 72, and 100 and 100, 83,
      74, and 91, respectively, and the activity for I. staphylina and A. indica
      against Hip. maculata were 100, 93, 87, and 66 and 78, 90, 87, and 100 at 2,000
      ppm, respectively; the larvicidal activity for the same extracts of I. staphylina
      against A. subpictus were 76, 82, 84, and 100 at 100 ppm, respectively. The
      maximum efficacy was observed in the leaf methanol extract of N. nucifera, hexane
      extract of M. zapota and leaf hexane extract of I. staphylina, and methanol
      extract of A. indica against the adults of H. bispinosa and Hip. maculata with
      LC(50) and LC(90) values of 437.14 and 200.81, and 415.14 and 280.72 ppm,
      1,927.57 and 703.52 ppm, and 1,647.70 and 829.39 ppm, respectively. The effective
      larvicidal activity was observed in leaf methanol extract of I. staphylina
      against A. subpictus with LC(50) and LC(90) values of 10.39 and 37.71 ppm,
      respectively. Therefore, this study provides the first report on the adulticidal 
      and larvicidal activity of crude solvent extracts. This is an ideal eco-friendly 
      approach for the control of H. bispinosa, Hip. maculata, and the medically
      important vector A. subpictus.

TI  - An integrated chromosome map of microsatellite markers and inversion breakpoints 
      for an Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 719-26
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esr072 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles stephensi is one of the major vectors of malaria in the Middle East and
      Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. Understanding the population genetic structure of
      malaria mosquitoes is important for developing adequate and successful vector
      control strategies. Commonly used markers for inferring anopheline taxonomic and 
      population status include microsatellites and chromosomal inversions. Knowledge
      about chromosomal locations of microsatellite markers with respect to polymorphic
      inversions could be useful for better understanding a genetic structure of
      natural populations. However, fragments with microsatellites used in population
      genetic studies are usually too short for successful labeling and hybridization
      with chromosomes. We designed new primers for amplification of microsatellite
      loci identified in the A. stephensi genome sequenced with next-generation
      technologies. Twelve microsatellites were mapped to polytene chromosomes from
      ovarian nurse cells of A. stephensi using fluorescent in situ hybridization. All 
      microsatellites hybridized to unique locations on autosomes, and 7 of them
      localized to the largest arm 2R. Ten microsatellites were mapped inside the
      previously described polymorphic chromosomal inversions, including 4 loci located
      inside the widespread inversion 2Rb. We analyzed microsatellite-based population 
      genetic data available for A. stephensi in light of our mapping results. This
      study demonstrates that the chromosomal position of microsatellites may affect
      estimates of population genetic parameters and highlights the importance of
      developing physical maps for nonmodel organisms.

AB  - Samples collected from the mangrove forests of Andaman & Nicobar islands yielded 
      a mosquitocidal bacterium, whose extracellular metabolite(s) exhibited mosquito
      larvicidal and pupicidal activity. The bacterium was isolated using standard
      microbiological methods and identified using classical biochemical tests and rpoB
      gene sequences. The mosquitocidal bacterium was identified as Bacillus
      amyloliquefaciens. Mosquitocidal metabolite(s) was separated from the culture
      supernatant of the bacterium and its efficacy against the larval and pupal stages
      of different species of mosquitoes was determined in terms of LC(50) and LC(90). 
      Mosquito larvicidal activity in terms of LC(50) against Anopheles stephensi,
      Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti was respectively, 26.4mug, 22.2mug and
      20.5mug/ml and its pupicidal activity was 4.4mug, 8.2mug and 14.5mug/ml
      respectively. The mosquitocidal metabolite(s) was found to be a biosurfactant.
      This is the first report of the mosquitocidal activity of B. amyloliquefaciens
      and it is a new weapon which can be added to the array of microbial agents for
      use against mosquitoes.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of medicinal plant extracts against Anopheles subpictus &
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing
      millions of deaths every year and the development of resistance to chemical
      insecticides resulting in rebounding vectorial capacity. Plants may be
      alternative sources of mosquito control agents. The present study assessed the
      role of larvicidal activities of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, and 
      methanol dried leaf and bark extracts of Annona squamosa L., Chrysanthemum
      indicum L., and Tridax procumbens L. against the fourth instar larvae of malaria 
      vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi and Japanese encephalitis vector, Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae). METHODS: Larvicidal activities of
      three medicinal plant extracts were studied in the range of 4.69 to 1000 mg/l in 
      the laboratory bioassays against early 4 th instar larvae of An. subpictus and
      Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The mortality data were subjected to probit analysis to
      determine the lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) to kill 50 and 90 per cent of
      the treated larvae of the respective species. RESULTS: All plant extracts showed 
      moderate effects after 24 h of exposure; however, the highest toxic effect of
      bark methanol extract of A. squamosa, leaf ethyl acetate extract of C. indicum
      and leaf acetone extract of T. procumbens against the larvae of An. subpictus (LC
      50 = 93.80, 39.98 and 51.57 mg/l) and bark methanol extract of A. squamosa, leaf 
      methanol extract of C. indicum and leaf ethyl acetate extract of T. procumbens
      against the larvae of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50 =104.94, 42.29 and 69.16 mg/l) 
      respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the bark ethyl 
      acetate and methanol extract of A. squamosa, leaf ethyl acetate and methanol
      extract of C. indicum, acetone and ethyl acetate extract of T. procumbens have
      the potential to be used as an ecofriendly approach for the control of the An.
      subpictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the larvicidal efficacy of different solvent leaf extract
      of Ficus benghalensis (F. benghalensis) against Culex tritaeniorhynchus (Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus) and Anopheles subpictus (An. subpictus). METHODS: Twenty five 
      early third instar larvae of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus were exposed
      to various concentrations and were assayed in the laboratory by using the
      protocol of WHO 2005. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of treatment. 
      RESULTS: Among three solvent extracts tested the maximum efficacy was observed in
      the methanol extract. The LC(50) and LC(90) values of F. benghalensis against
      early third instar of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus were 100.88, 159.76
      ppm and 56.66, 85.84 ppm, respectively. No mortality was observed in controls.
      The chi-square values were significant at P<0.05 level. CONCLUSIONS: From the
      results it can be concluded the crude extract of F. benghalensis was an excellent
      potential for controlling Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus mosquito
      larvae.

LID - 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.007 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we analyzed a small scale transcriptome of salivary glands in
      sugar fed female mosquitoes. Thirty five percent of the transcripts could not be 
      assigned a function. Some of them may code for salivary gland specific products
      involved in sugar feeding. We identified and characterized two new putative cDNAs
      encoding a sugar transporter and a cAMP generating DAPIT (Diabetes-Associated
      proteins in insulin sensitive tissues). Down regulation of these two cDNAs in
      response to blood feeding suggest that both AsST and AsDAPIT salivary genes may
      specifically be involved in the facilitation of sugar metabolism and energy
      production. The inability to absorb or digest sugar may cause organ failure,
      improper functioning of nervous system, behavioral disorder and death. Further
      functional characterization of theses putative transcripts is under investigation
      to examine their role in the mosquito salivary glands.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the most potent petroleum ether extract
      of Artemisia annua (A. annua) and Azadirachta indica (Az. indica) on total
      carbohydrate, lipid and protein level of Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus larvae. METHODS: Mosquito larvae were exposed to the extracts
      selected as per standard WHO procedure. Carbohydrate (glucose), total lipid and
      protein were estimated by the methods as Nelson, Bragdon and Lowry described,
      respectively. RESULTS: The glucose levels were increased to 27.87% and 46.8%,
      respectively in anopheline larval tissues after treatment with petroleum ether
      extract of A. annua and methanolic extract of Az. indica. In culicine larvae,
      glucose levels were reduced to 58.96% and 24.65%, respectively. After treatment
      with A. annua extract, lipid contents in anopheline and culicine larvae decreased
      by 28.57% and 25.0%, respectively and increased by 14.29% and 50.00% in the
      Anopheles and Culex larvae, respectively after treatment with methanolic extract 
      of Az. indica. Total protein levels were reduced to 63.13% and 92.62% in
      anopheline and to 32.39% and 48.12% in culicine larvae after treatment with A.
      annua and Az. Indica extracts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Two extracts produce
      significant alterations in the biochemical profiles of anopheline and culicine
      larvae. Further, the impacting factors of extracts on carbohydrate, lipid and
      protein contents of larvae are species and specific extraction. It indicates the 
      disturbed metabolic activity of the larvae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the larvicidal activities of crude and chloroform:
      methanol (1:1 v/v) extracts of some common spices (Cuminum cyminum, Allium
      sativum, Zingiber offinale, Curcuma longa) and vegetable waste (Solanum tuberosum
      germinated tuber) against Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito
      larvae. METHODS: Larval mortality of above mosquito species were observed after
      24, 48 and 72 h of exposure to five concentrations of aqueous extract (0.1%,
      0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5%) and four concentrations (25, 50, 75 ppm) of
      chloroform: methanol (1:1 v/v) extract. The lethal concentration of individual
      spices or vegetable waste was determined by log-probit analysis (at 95%
      confidence level) and effect of crude and chloroform: methanol (1:1 v/v) extracts
      were recorded on non target organisms. RESULTS: Relative mortality rate of both
      larval mosquito species were recorded in the following sequences: Cuminum cyminum
      >Allium sativum >Zingiber offinale, Curcuma longa >Solanum tuberosum germinated
      tuber for crude extract, and efficacy of chloroform: methanol (1:1 v/v) extract
      were as follows: Curcuma longa >Zingiber offinale >Solanum tuberosum germinated
      tuber >Cuminum cyminum >Allium sativum. CONCLUSIONS: Crude and chloroform:
      methanol (1:1 v/v) extract of Cuminum cyminum, Allium sativum, Zingiber offinale,
      Curcuma longa and Solanum tuberosum germinated tuber can be recommended
      effectively in mosquito control programmes at very low concentrations. No
      mortality and other abnormalities were noticed on non target organisms and
      further studies are needed to investigate the chemical structure of active
      principal which are responsible for larvicidal activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the larvicidal and repellent properties of essential
      oils from various parts of four plant species Cymbopogan citrates, Cinnamomum
      zeylanicum, Rosmarinus officinalis and Zingiber officinale against Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus (Cx. tritaeniorhynchus) and Anopheles subpictus (An.
      subpictus). METHODS: Essential oils were obtained by hydro-distillation method.
      The mosquitoes were reared in the vector control laboratory and twenty five late 
      third instar larvae of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus were exposed to
      based on the wide range and narrow range test, essential oil tested at various
      concentrations ranging from 25 to 250 ppm. The larval mortality was observed
      after 24 h under the laboratory conditions. The repellent efficacy was determined
      against two mosquito species at three concentrations viz., 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0
      mg/cm(2) under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Results showed all the four plant 
      essential oil produced significant larval mortality against two mosquito species.
      However, the highest larvicidal activity was observed in the essential oil from
      Zingiber officinale against Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus with the
      LC(50) and LC(90) values as 98.83, 57.98 ppm and 186.55, 104.23 ppm,
      respectively. All the four essential oil shows significant repellency against Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus than An. subpictus. Among four essential oil tested the highest
      repellency was observed in Zingiber officinale, a higher concentration of 5.0
      mg/cm(2) provided 100% protection up to 150 and 180 min against Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus and An. subpictus, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, it 
      can be concluded that four essential oils which were distilled from Cymbopogan
      citrates, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Rosmarinus officinalis and Zingiber officinale
      showed promising larvicidal and repellent agent against Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and
      An. subpictus.

AB  - The leaf extract of Acalypha alnifolia with different solvents - hexane,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol - were tested for larvicidal
      activity against three important mosquitoes such as malarial vector, Anopheles
      stephensi, dengue vector, Aedes aegypti and Bancroftian filariasis vector, Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. The medicinal plants were collected from the area around Kallar
      Hills near the Western Ghats, Coimbatore, India. A. alnifolia plant was washed
      with tap water and shade dried at room temperature. The dried leaves were
      powdered mechanically using commercial electrical stainless steel blender. The
      powder 800 g of the leaf material was extract with 2.5 litre of various each
      organic solvents such as hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol for
      8 h using Soxhlet apparatus, and filtered. The crude plant extracts were
      evaporated to dryness in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The yield of extracts was
      hexane (8.64 g), chloroform (10.74 g), ethyl acetate (9.14 g), acetone (10.02 g),
      and methanol (11.43 g). One gram of the each plant residue was dissolved
      separately in 100 ml of acetone (stock solution) from which different
      concentrations, i.e., 50, 150, 250, 350 and 450 ppm, was prepared. The hexane,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone was moderate considerable mortality; however, 
      the highest larval mortality was methanolic extract observed in three mosquito
      vectors. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. No mortality was 
      observed in the control. The early fourth-instar larvae of A. stephensi had
      values of LC(50) = 197.37, 178.75, 164.34, 149.90 and 125.73 ppm and LC(90) =
      477.60, 459.21, 435.07, 416.20 and 395.50 ppm, respectively. The A. aegypti had
      values of LC(50) = 202.15, 182.58, 160.35, 146.07 and 128.55 ppm and LC(90) =
      476.57, 460.83, 440.78, 415.38 and 381.67 ppm, respectively. The C.
      quinquefasciatus had values of LC(50) = 198.79, 172.48, 151.06, 140.69 and 127.98
      ppm and LC(90) = 458.73, 430.66, 418.78, 408.83 and 386.26 ppm, respectively. The
      results of the leaf extract of A. alnifloia are promising as good larvicidal
      activity against the mosquito vector, A. stephensi, A. aegypti, C.
      quinquefasciatus. Therefore, this study provides first report on the larvicidal
      activities against three species of mosquito vectors of this plant extracts from 
      Southern India.

AB  - Integrated vector control is an effective and essential part of any successful
      vector control program. Increasing insecticide resistance requires strategies to 
      prolong the use of highly effective vector control compounds. Synergistic
      activity between current effective pesticides is a powerful tool and is one such 
      strategy. In the current study, Cyt1A from Bacillus thurigiensis subsp.
      israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus B101H5aH5b Bs were evaluated for the
      synergistic activity against B. sphaericus-resistant strains of Anopheles
      stephensi. The combinations of Cyt1A and B. sphaericus were found to act
      synergistically and were greatly enhanced at different ratios. A ratio of 1:4 of 
      Cyt1A and Bs was 13,200-fold more toxic at LC(90) against the Bs-resistant
      strains of A. stephensi than was Bs alone and this high level of activity
      resulted from synergism between Cyt1A toxin and Bs. Our results therefore suggest
      that Cyt1A may enhance toxicity by facilitating the binding or insertion of the
      binary toxins to the microvillar membrane.

TI  - Malaria incidence among paramilitary personnel in an endemic area of Tripura.
PG  - 665-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Paramilitary operations along the Indo-Bangladesh border
      are adversely affected by malaria induced morbidity and mortality. Villages
      surrounding the paramilitary installations often serve as disease reservoirs.
      Malaria incidence in Tripura State Rifles (TSR) units in Dhalai District of
      Tripura was studied and the role of the village population in disease
      transmission was also assessed. METHODS: Mass blood surveys were carried out
      among TSR personnel and villagers during 2007 to 2009. Malaria diagnosis through 
      blood smear examination and rapid detection kits was done, and percentage
      parasitaemia was determined. Activity of malaria vectors was monitored using CDC 
      light traps. RESULTS: Slide positivity rates (SPR) in the neighbouring villages
      (51.4%) was significantly higher than that in TSR (27.7%) (P<0.0001). Malaria
      incidence in villages did not show seasonal variability while it was lowest
      during post-monsoon season in TSR (P<0.325; OR = 0.74). Per cent Pf parasitaemia 
      was high in TSR (0.29) as compared to villagers (0.20) (P<0.0001). Anopheles
      minimus and An. dirus were the major malaria vectors observed. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSIONS: Paramilitary and public health authorities should adopt targeted
      measures to reduce the malaria incidence in the villages surrounding the
      paramilitary installations as the village populations play a major role in
      disease transmission.

TI  - Seasonal prevalence & resting behaviour of Anopheles minimus Theobald & An.
      fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) in east-central India.
PG  - 655-61
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles minimus has recently been reported to have
      re-appeared in Keonjhar district of Orissa after a period of about 45 years of
      launching the malaria eradication programme. An. minimus and An. fluviatilis were
      the incriminated major malaria vectors in the district, endemic for falciparum
      malaria. The information on seasonal prevalence and resting behaviour of the
      vectors is crucial for implementing appropriate malaria control measures.
      Therefore, a study was undertaken on seasonal prevalence and resting behaviour of
      An. minimus and An. fluviatilis in this district. METHODS: Seven randomly
      selected villages of Keonjhar district, Orissa, were studied during August 2005
      to November 2007. Daytime resting collections indoors and outdoors were made
      covering three seasons of the year. The Anopheles mosquitoes obtained from
      different habitats were identified. Collections were maintained separately
      according to different sites as well as heights of the walls in human dwellings. 
      RESULTS: Among the indoor collections, the densities of An. minimus and An.
      fluviatilis were higher in human dwellings than cattle sheds. An. fluviatilis was
      the predominant (41.5%) species followed by An. minimus (26.3%) in human
      dwellings. The density of both the vector species in human dwellings peaked
      during rainy and winter seasons followed by summer. Walls were the most preferred
      site by these vectors for resting and the maximum number was collected at a
      height of 3 to 4 ft. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The resting behaviour of the
      vector species increases their contact with the sprayed walls and therefore, a
      quality residual spraying of human dwellings focusing indoor walls could
      interrupt the malaria transmission in this area.

TI  - Assessing perceptions about malaria among the elected representatives in rural
      India.
PG  - 83-7
LID - 10.4103/2229-5070.86938 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short-term objective of our endeavour was to understand the
      perception of Grama panchayat presidents and secretaries on the issues related to
      malaria and its control, being the key leaders of the Panchayat Raj Institutions 
      (PRIs) at a Grama panchayat level. This was necessary to achieve the long-term
      objective of the role of PRIs in malaria control and their enhanced
      participation/partnership with the public health sector. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Grama panchayat presidents and secretaries representing all the 28 Grama
      panchayats of Chikkanayakanahalli taluk Tumkur district in Karnataka were invited
      for a 1-day workshop. Deliberations with the participants (n = 32) shed light on 
      their perceptions with respect to knowledge, attitude and practice vis-a-vis
      malaria and its control strategies. RESULTS: Their knowledge of malaria as a
      disease was fairly good as they were well aware of it being a communicable
      disease and its transmission by mosquitoes. However, knowledge about the breeding
      sources of malaria mosquitoes (Anophelines) was very poor. Many practices in
      vogue to control mosquitoes at the community level were unscientific. There was a
      general negative attitude toward the government's handling of the malaria problem
      and the credibility of the health care system. CONCLUSION: Existence of health
      committees in every Grama panchayat coupled with their jurisdiction and
      responsibilities toward sanitation, water supply and health care resources makes 
      PRIs a natural partner to the health sector. While health education and public
      health intervention strategies should be based on generic principles of science, 
      the implementation and operational specifics should definitely be based on a
      sociological perspective of the stakeholders.

TI  - Variations in salinity tolerance of malaria vectors of the Anopheles subpictus
      complex in Sri Lanka and the implications for malaria transmission.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-4-117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato, a widespread vector of malaria in
      Asia, is reportedly composed of four sibling species A-D based on distinct
      cytogenetic and morphological characteristics. However An. subpictus species B
      specimens in Sri Lanka are termed An. subpictus B/ An. sundaicus because of
      recent genetic data. Differences in salinity tolerance and coastal/inland
      prevalence of An. subpictus sibling species that were not previously established 
      in Sri Lanka are presented here. RESULTS: Specimens with morphological
      characteristics of all four Indian An. subpictus sibling species were found in
      Sri Lanka. Sibling species A, C and D tended to be predominant in inland, and An.
      subpictus species B/An. sundaicus, in coastal localities. Sibling species C was
      predominant in both adult and larval inland collections. Larvae of An. subpictus 
      B/An. sundaicus were found in inland and coastal sites, including a lagoon, with 
      salinity varying from 0 to 30 ppt. An. subpictus sibling species A, C and D
      larvae were present in water of salinity between 0 to 4 ppt. An. subpictus C, D
      and An. subpictus B/An. sundaicus larvae showed compatible differential salinity 
      tolerance in laboratory tests. The first instar larvae of An. subpictus B/An.
      sundaicus showed 100% survival up to 15 ppt in comparison to species C and D
      where the corresponding values were 3 ppt and 6 ppt respectively. However all
      third instar larvae of An. subpictus B/An. sundaicus survived up to 30 ppt
      salinity whereas An. subpictus C and D tolerated up to 4 ppt and 8 ppt salinity
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that An. subpictus species B/An.
      sundaicus breed in fresh, brackish and nearly saline water while An. subpictus
      species C and D do so in fresh and less brackish waters in Sri Lanka, as in
      India. Because of the established role of An. sundaicus s.l. and An. subpictus
      s.l. as malaria vectors, the findings indicate a need for greater monitoring of
      brackish water breeding habitats in Asia. Tolerance to 15 ppt salinity may also
      constitute a simple method for differentiating An. subpictus B/An. sundaicus
      larvae from those of An. subpictus species C and D in field studies.

      blood-sucking parasites.
PG  - 1151-63
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2493-2 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the acaricidal and larvicidal property
      of marine actinobacterial compound
      (2S,5R,6R)-2-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethyloctan-4-one extracted and isolated from
      Streptomyces sp. VITDDK3 tested against the larvae of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)
      microplus Canestrini (Acari: Ixodidae), Anopheles subpictus Grassi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). The isolate was taxonomically
      characterised, identified and designated as Streptomyces sp. VITDDK3. The crude
      compound was loaded on silica gel column and eluted with
      chloroform-methanol-water. The purity of the compound isolated was analysed by
      thin layer chromatography using chloroform and methanol as the solvent system and
      confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the
      purified compound was established from infrared, ultraviolet, (1)H-nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR), (13)C-NMR and mass spectral data. The chemical shift
      assignments obtained for the aliphatic compound from (1)H-NMR corresponding to
      the molecular formula C(11)H(22)O(2). Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the
      isolation of compound, which was identified as
      (2S,5R,6R)-2-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethyloctan-4-one. In the present study,
      Streptomyces sp. VITDDK3 crude extract and different fractions were tested
      against the larvae of parasites at a concentration of 1,000 ppm. Those fractions 
      showing 100% mortality in 24 h alone was selected for further column
      chromatographic separation. The purified compound
      (2S,5R,6R)-2-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethyloctan-4-one was tested in the concentrations 
      of 250, 200, 150, 100 and 50 ppm and observed the per cent mortality of 100, 88, 
      62, 50 and 36 against R. microplus; 100, 100, 87, 62 and 39 against A. subpitcus;
      and 100, 94, 79, 51 and 33 against C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The crude
      extract showed parasitic effects after 24 h of exposure at 1,000 ppm, and
      parasite mortality was observed against the larvae of R. microplus (LC(50) =
      88.74 ppm; r (2) = 0.865) against the larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) = 162.59
      ppm; r (2) = 0.817) and against C. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 120.15 ppm; r (2) =
      0.782), respectively. The maximum efficacy was observed in purified marine
      actinobacterial compound (2S,5R,6R)-2-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethyloctan-4-one with
      LC(50) and r (2) values against the larvae of R. microplus (94.49 ppm; 0.982) and
      A. subpictus (69.65 ppm; 0.906) and against C. quinquefasciatus (82.82 ppm;
      0.957), respectively. The control (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the
      concurrent assay.

TI  - Nitrogen fixation in Asaia sp. (family Acetobacteraceae).
PG  - 226-31
LID - 10.1007/s00284-011-9968-3 [doi]
AB  - The genus Asaia (family Acetobacteraceae) was first introduced with a single
      species-Asaia bogorensis and later six more species were described namely A.
      siamensis, A. krungthepensis, A. lannaensis, A. platycodi, A. prunellae, and A.
      astilbes. Acetobacteraceae family has been divided into ten genera but, only
      three of them include nitrogen fixing species: Gluconacetobacter, Acetobacter,
      and Swaminathania. This article originated from our study primarily aimed to
      isolate new endosymbiotic nitrogen fixer among Acetobacteraceae during which we
      have isolated, for the first time in India, four different strains of Asaia sp.
      from three different sources: Michalia champaca flower, Anopheles mosquito, and
      ant Tetraponera rufonigra. All the endosymbiotic strains isolated possess the
      ability to fix nitrogen. Evidence for both nitrogenase activity and the presence 
      of nifH gene in isolated Asaia sp. is presented. Asaia bogorensis (MTCC 4041(T)) 
      and A. siamensis (MTCC 4042(T)), two of the validated type strains available from
      the repository, were tested positive for the presence of functional nitrogenase. 
      The nifH gene sequences from these type strains were also confirmed and compared 
      with other nitrogen fixing members of the family Acetobacteraceae. Our result
      corroborate with the previous reports that Asaia sp. are indeed widely
      distributed in nature but this is the first time demonstration of their
      functional nitrogenase activity. This study shows Asaia sp. as fourth genera of
      nitrogen fixing bacteria in the family Acetobacteraceae.

LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.05.013 [doi]
AB  - North-east India is co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria,
      and disease transmission is perennial and persistent. This study reports the
      results of a field-based village scale trial of deltamethrin incorporated
      long-lasting polyethylene netting (Netprotect((R))) conducted in P. falciparum
      predominant pocket of Assam, north-east India to assess operational feasibility, 
      acceptability and sustainability against disease vectors and malaria
      transmission. The study monitored the residual efficacy of the long-lasting net
      in relation to serial washings in the laboratory and malaria prevalence in
      experimental villages for the first year of investigations from September 2008 to
      June 2009. The mosquito vector populations of Anopheles minimus were observed to 
      be highly susceptible to deltamethrin (0.05%), and follow up investigations
      revealed that the vector mosquito had virtually disappeared in Netprotect((R))
      intervention villages. Concurrently, there was consistent decline in malaria
      cases in Netprotect((R)) villages and transmission reduction was statistically
      significant compared to untreated net (net without insecticide) and no-net
      control villages for the corresponding study period. The contact cone-bioassay
      investigations against malaria transmitting mosquito species revealed that the
      bioavailability of the insecticide on the net fiber was persistent up to 20th
      serial wash resulting in >/=80% mortality. Community compliance and acceptance
      were high, and users reported decreased nuisance due to biting mosquitoes. It was
      concluded that deltamethrin incorporated polyethylene long-lasting netting was
      safe, wash-resistant, and assessed to be an operationally feasible,
      community-based intervention for sustainable management of disease vectors to
      prevent malaria transmission.

TI  - Glutathione S transferase activity in Indian vectors of malaria: A defense
      mechanism against DDT.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Glutathione S transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes involved in
      detoxification of xenobiotic compounds in majority of the insect groups.
      Significance of insect GSTs is their elevated level of activity in association
      with insecticide resistance. This investigation was to explore the metabolic
      status of GSTs in two Indian DDT-resistant malaria vectors, Anopheles
      culicifacies and Anopheles annularis, and one DDT-susceptible vector, Anopheles
      fluviatilis. Malkangiri and Koraput districts of Orissa State, endemic for
      falciparum malaria and having a long insecticide spraying history, were the study
      areas. F1 progeny was raised from wild-caught females of the three vectors and
      used for biochemical assays to detect the GST-mediated DDT resistance mechanism. 
      Results of the enzyme assay showed a significant 3-fold increase in GST activity 
      in DDT-resistant An. annularis compared with its susceptible population. In
      DDT-resistant An. culicifacies, the median GST activity (71.8 micromol/min/mg)
      was almost the same as estimated in the DDT-resistant An. annularis (74.6
      micromol/ min/mg), suggesting that the GST activity estimated in An. culicifacies
      could be an elevated level for detoxification of DDT. Furthermore, the GST
      activity in DDT-resistant An. culicifacies and An. annularis was significantly
      higher than that in the DDT-susceptible An. fluviatilis, which had a GST activity
      of 20.0 micromol/min/mg. Also, the GST-mediated DDT detoxification was confirmed 
      by comparing GST activity in wild-caught females with that in their F1 progeny.

TI  - Evaluation of culture filtrates of Culicinomyces clavisporus: Mycoadulticide for 
      Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 267-72

AB  - The Culicinomyces clavisporus is a fungal pathogen of a wide range of mosquito
      larvae. The C. clavisporus was isolated from the larvae of Culiseta inornata. We 
      have investigated into potential pathogenicity against the adults of Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. The culture filtrates
      released from the strain of C. clavisporus 46258 were grown in the EmYPss broth, 
      were filtered and used for the bioassays after a growth of 15 days. The results
      demonstrated these metabolites with LC(50), LC(90) and LC(99) values of C.
      quinquefasciatus, 5.62, 8.71 and 12.59, A. aegypti, 3.0, 7.0 and 9.3, and A.
      stephensi 2.69, 6.0 and 7.24 mul/cm(2), respectively after exposure for 24 h.
      These results compared favorably with the commercial adulticide Gokilaht((R))-S
      5EC (d,d-trans-cyphenothrin) that showed 100% mortality at the same
      concentration. This study successfully identified that the metabolites of C.
      clavisporus can be used as mosquitoes adulticide as safer alternative to modern
      synthetic chemical insecticide against mosquito vector of diseases. Further
      purification can lead to biotechnological exploitation.

      parasites.
PG  - 921-33
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2473-6 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the acaricidal and larvicidal
      activity against the larvae of Haemaphysalis bispinosa Neumann (Acarina:
      Ixodidae) and larvae of hematophagous fly Hippobosca maculata Leach (Diptera:
      Hippoboscidae) and against the fourth-instar larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles 
      stephensi Liston, Japanese encephalitis vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles
      (Diptera: Culicidae) of synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing
      aqueous leaf extract from Musa paradisiaca L. (Musaceae). The color of the
      extract changed to light brown within an hour, and later it changed to dark brown
      during the 30-min incubation period. AgNPs results were recorded from UV-vis
      spectrum at 426 nm; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed that the
      bioreduction of Ag(+) ions to silver nanoparticles are due to the reduction by
      capping material of plant extract, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns clearly
      illustrates that the nanoparticles formed in the present synthesis are
      crystalline in nature and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) support the
      biosynthesis and characterization of AgNPs with rod in shape and size of 60-150
      nm. After reaction, the XRD pattern of AgNPs showed diffraction peaks at 2theta =
      34.37 degrees , 38.01 degrees , 44.17 degrees , 66.34 degrees and 77.29 degrees
      assigned to the (100), (111), (102), (110) and (120) planes, respectively, of a
      faced centre cubic (fcc) lattice of silver were obtained. For electron
      microscopic studies, a 25 mul sample was sputter-coated on copper stub, and the
      images of nanoparticles were studied using scanning electron microscopy. The spot
      EDX analysis showed the complete chemical composition of the synthesized AgNPs.
      The parasite larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extract of 
      M. paradisiaca and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. In the present study, the percent 
      mortality of aqueous extract of M. paradisiaca were 82, 71, 46, 29, 11 and 78,
      66, 38, 31and 16 observed in the concentrations of 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 mg/l for 24
      h against the larvae of H. bispinosa and Hip. maculata, respectively. The maximum
      efficacy was observed in the aqueous extract of M. paradisiaca against the H.
      bispinosa, Hip. maculata, and the larvae of A. stephensi, C. tritaeniorhynchus
      with LC(50) values of 28.96, 31.02, 26.32, and 20.10 mg/lm, respectively (r (2) =
      0.990, 0.968, 0.974, and 0.979, respectively). The synthesized AgNPs of M.
      paradisiaca showed the LC(50) and r (2) values against H. bispinosa, (1.87 mg/l; 
      0.963), Hip. maculata (2.02 mg/l; 0.976), and larvae of A. stephensi (1.39; 0.900
      mg/l), against C. tritaeniorhynchus (1.63 mg/l; 0.951), respectively. The chi (2)
      values were significant at p < 0.05 level.

AB  - The efficacy of whole plant extracts of Leucas aspera and Bacillus sphaericus has
      been proven against larvicidal and pupicidal activities of the malarial vector,
      Anopheles stephensi. The present study investigated the larvicidal and pupicidal 
      activity against the first to fourth instar lavae and pupae of the
      laboratory-reared mosquitoes, A. stephensi. The medicinal plants were collected
      from the area around Maruthamalai hills, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. L. aspera
      whole plant was washed with tap water and shade dried at room temperature. The
      dried plant materials were powdered by an electric blender. From the powder, 100 
      g of the plant materials was extracted with 300 ml of organic solvents of ethanol
      for 8 h using a Soxhlet apparatus. The extracts were filtered through a Buchner
      funnel with Whatman number 1 filter paper. The crude plant extracts were
      evaporated to dryness in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The plant extract showed
      larvicidal and pupicidal effects after 24 h of exposure. All larval instars and
      pupae have considerably moderate mortality; however, the highest larval mortality
      was the ethanolic extract of whole plant L. aspera against the first to fourth
      instar larvae and pupae values of LC(50) = I instar was 9.695%, II instar was
      10.272%, III instar was 10.823%, and IV instar was 11.303%, and pupae was
      12.732%. B. spaericus against the first to fouth instar larvae and pupae had the 
      following values: I instar was 0.051%, II instar was 0.057%, III instar was
      0.062%, IV instar was 0.066%, and for the pupae was 0.073%. No mortality was
      observed in the control. The present results suggest that the ethanolic extracts 
      of L. aspera and B. sphaericus provided an excellent potential for controlling of
      malarial vector, A. stephensi.

PG  - 135-42
AB  - The epidemiological and entomological investigations were carried out in 18
      tribal villages of Godda district of Jharkhand state revealed average slide
      positivity rate (SPR) 9.9% and slide positivity rate for Plasmodium falciparum
      (SfR) 5.0%, respectively. P. falciparum was the dominant parasite accounting 51.2
      per cent of the total infections. All the villages are situated in the deep
      forest and forest fringes. A total of 416 blood slides were collected and
      examined. Out of which 41 slides were found positive for malaria parasite (21
      positive for P. falciparum and 20 positive for P. vivax). All the positive cases 
      were treated with Blister Packs of anti-malarial of chloroquine and primaquine as
      per NBVDCP schedule to prevent further transmission of malaria, which were
      available. Rapid diagnostic Kits were used selectively only on the recommendation
      of the Physician/Medical Officer. Results of house to house fever survey
      indicated the presence of high percentage of symptomatic carriers of malaria
      parasites in the local population and in our study Pf % is more than reported
      data by District Malaria Office, Godda district, Jharkhand. In entomological
      studies, for mosquito fauna with reference to both Anopheline, 11 species
      belonging to one genus Anopheles were collected and identified during the survey;
      among them some species were most prevalent. A total of 599 mosquitoes were
      recorded and average density of mosquitoes recorded was 13.19 in human dwellings 
      and 86.11 in cattle sheds.

      species of Anopheles culicifacies, reported to exhibit differential vectorial
      capacity. The mosquitoes that ingested anti-midgut antibodies along with
      infectious parasites had significantly fewer oocysts compared to the control
      group of mosquitoes. The immunized rabbits generated high titer of antibodies.
      Their cross reactivity amongst various tissues of the same species and with other
      sibling species was also determined. Immunogenic polypeptides expressed in the
      midgut of glucose or blood fed An. culicifacies sibling species were identified
      by Western blotting. One immunogenic polypeptide of 62 kDa was exclusively
      present in the midgut of species A. Similarly, three polypeptides of 97, 94 and
      58 kDa and one polypeptide of 23 kDa were present exclusively in species B and C 
      respectively. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the localization of these
      antigens on baso-lateral membrane and microvilli. The effects of anti-mosquito
      midgut antibodies on fecundity, longevity, mortality and engorgement of
      mosquitoes were studied. Fecundity was also reduced significantly. These
      observations open an avenue for research toward the development of a vector-based
      malaria parasite transmission-blocking vaccine.

TI  - Effect of construction of an irrigation canal on malaria situation in two primary
      health centres of Dhenkanal district of Orissa, India.
PG  - 76-84
AB  - To assess the impact of irrigation canals on malaria transmission, a study was
      conducted in Dhenkanal district of Orissa, India. The district is situated in the
      central part of Orissa and hyperendemic area for malaria. A canal system is being
      constructed for irrigation in the district, which passes through Parjang and
      Analabereni Primary Health Centres (PHC), endemic for malaria. The water has been
      released only up to Parjang (Canal with water -CWW) area during the end of 2004
      and construction work is still going on in Analabereni PHC (Canal under
      construction-CUC). Retrospective clinical data (2001-2008) collected from health 
      services from two study sites showed average Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) before
      release of water (2001-2004) was 9.25% and 18.04% in CWW and CUC areas,
      respectively. After release of water (2005-2008) the SPR was 5.77% and 10.19%, in
      CWW and CUC areas, respectively. The average Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was 
      7.66 and 22.67 in CWW and CUC areas before the release of water and 5.32 and
      12.28 after release of water, respectively. A point fever survey was conducted in
      2009 which revealed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv) 
      in both study areas. The survey found SPR of 18.82% and 24.54%, and Pf
      percentages of 75% and 85%, in CWW and CUC areas, respectively. The present study
      revealed the presence of two malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and
      Anopheles annularis in the area. Vector Per Man Hour Density was 2.38 in CWW and 
      2.69 in CUC for An. culicifacies and 1.46 and 1.54 for An. annularis
      respectively. The sporozoites rates were found to be 3.6 and 3.8 for CWW and CUC,
      respectively. The present study reveals that, the construction of canal system
      did not increase the malaria prevalence during post water release period -
      implying that the malaria control programme was effective although still more
      intensive situation specific vectors control programme need to be continued
      simultaneously so that malaria transmission can be curtailed.

TI  - Mosquito diversity in the Chilika lake area, Orissa, India.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Twenty-two species of mosquitoes belonging to six genera (Anopheles, Aedeomyia,
      Aedes, Armigeres, Culex and Mansonia) were collected from eight villages in and
      around the Chilika lake area, Khurda and Puri Districts from 2006-2007. Greater
      numbers of the culicines (65.59%) were collected from the area, as compared with 
      the anophelines (34.4%). Mansonia indiana and Mansonia dives were reported for
      the first time from the area. The values of the species richness (S), Shannon
      Index (H), and Shanon evenness (Es) between anophelines and culicines were 10,
      12; 0.89, 1.85; 0.38, 0.74, respectively. Based on biostatistical analysis, the
      culicines were more diverse than anophelines in the study area.

AB  - In recent years, uses of environment friendly and biodegradable natural
      insecticides of plant origin have received renewed attention as agents for vector
      control. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of aril and
      kernel extracts of Knema attenuata (Hook. f. & Thomson) Warb. (Myristicaceae) on 
      larvae of Aedes albopictus Skuse and Anopheles stephensi Liston under laboratory 
      conditions. The aril was extracted with chloroform and ethanol; the kernel was
      extracted with ethanol and hexane. The extracts were tested against the 3rd-4th
      instar larvae collected from Bunder area, Mangalore, India, which is a well-known
      fishing harbour, where several mosquito-borne diseases were reported. All the
      graded concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ppm) showed significant larval 
      mortality after 24 h of observation. Chloroform extracts of aril showed 100%
      mortality against both larval forms of A. albopictus and A. stephensi at the
      concentration of 500 ppm. Among the extracts tested, chloroform extracts of aril 
      and ethanol extracts of kernel exhibited higher toxicity against both A.
      albopictus (LC(50), 141 ppm and 159 ppm; LC(90), 290 ppm and 342 ppm) and A.
      stephensi (LC(50), 160 ppm and 162 ppm; LC90, 445 ppm and 458 ppm). Hexane
      extracts of kernel exhibited least toxicity against A. albopictus (LC50, 239 ppm;
      LC(90), 484 ppm), whereas ethanol extracts of aril showed the least toxicity
      against A. stephensi (LC(50), 290; LC(90), 498). A preliminary phytochemical
      assay revealed the presence of phenolics, tannins, steroids, terpenes, resins,
      and glycolipids in all the extracts. Alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins were
      absent. The lower LC(50) value of the chloroform extracts of K. attenuata aril
      indicates its potentiality as a larvicide against A. albopictus and A. stephensi 
      mosquito larvae.

TI  - Malaria control in a forest fringe area of Assam, India: a pilot study.
PG  - 327-32
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2011.02.008 [doi]
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the preventive efficacy of insecticide-treated 
      mosquito nets (ITMNs) and mosquito repellent (MR) in a malaria-endemic foothill
      area of Assam, India, with forest ecosystem. During the first year, a survey was 
      conducted in four demarcated sectors (A-D) to observe the malaria endemicity and 
      vector prevalence patterns before implementing intervention measures. All four
      sectors were endemic for malaria. The prevalence of established malaria vectors
      such as Anopheles dirus, A. minimus and A. philippinensis was observed. During
      the second year, intervention measures were implemented in the four sectors as
      follows: A, ITMN + MR; B, ITMN; C, MR; D, no intervention. The most effective
      intervention was in sector A, followed by sectors B and C. Sectors A and B
      exhibited significantly higher (P < 0.001) malaria protective efficacy during
      both the first and second years of intervention compared with sector D. The total
      vector population in the three intervention sectors decreased significantly
      compared with that of the non-intervention one.
      Information-education-communication activities motivated the residents to
      participate actively in the intervention programme. The finding could be an
      effective model for containment of high malaria morbidity in inaccessible forest 
      fringe areas of the northeastern region of India.

TI  - Biolarvicidal compound gymnemagenol isolated from leaf extract of miracle fruit
      plant, Gymnema sylvestre (Retz) Schult against malaria and filariasis vectors.
PG  - 1373-86
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2384-6 [doi]
AB  - Owing to the fact that the application of synthetic larvicide has envenomed the
      surroundings as well as non-target organisms, natural products of plant origin
      with insecticidal properties have been tried as an indigenous method for the
      control of a variety of insect pests and vectors in the recent past. Insecticides
      of plant origin have been extensively used on agricultural pests and, to a very
      limited extent, against insect vectors of public health importance, which deserve
      careful and thorough screening. The use of plant extracts for insect control has 
      several appealing features as these are generally more biodegradable, less
      hazardous and a rich storehouse of chemicals of diverse biological activities.
      Moreover, herbal sources give a lead for discovering new insecticides. Therefore,
      biologically active plant materials have attracted considerable interest in
      mosquito control study in recent times. The crude leaf extracts of Gymnema
      sylvestre (Retz) Schult (Asclepiadaceae) and purified gymnemagenol compound were 
      studied against the early fourth-instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus Grassi and 
      Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). In the present study,
      bioassay-guided fractionation of petroleum ether leaf extract of G. sylvestre led
      to the separation and identification of gymnemagenol as a potential new
      antiparasitic compound. Phytochemical analysis of G. sylvestre leaves revealed
      the presence of active constituents such as carbohydrates, saponins,
      phytosterols, phenols, flavonoids and tannins. However, cardiac glycosides and
      phlobatannins are absent in the plant extracts. Quantitative analysis results
      suggested that saponin (5%) was present in a high concentration followed by
      tannins (1.0%). The 50 g powder was loaded on silica gel column and eluted with
      chloroform-methanol-water as eluents. From that, 16 mg pure saponin compound was 
      isolated and analysed by thin layer chromatography using chloroform and methanol 
      as the solvent systems. The structure of the purified triterpenoid fraction was
      established from infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance
      (NMR), (13)C NMR and mass spectral data. The carbon skeleton of the compound was 
      obtained by (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The chemical shift assignments obtained for
      gymnemagenol from (1)H NMR correspond to the molecular formula C(30)H(50)O(4).
      The compound was identified as 3beta, 16beta, 28, 29-tetrahydroxyolean-12-ene
      (gymnemagenol sapogenin). Parasite larvae were exposed to varying concentrations 
      of purified compound gymnemagenol for 24 h. The results suggested that the larval
      mortality effects of the compound were 28%, 69%, 100% and 31%, 63%, 100% at 6, 12
      and 24 h against A. subpictus and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. In the
      present study, the per cent mortality were 100, 86, 67, 36, 21 and 100, 78, 59,
      38 and 19 observed in the concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, 125 and 62.75 ppm
      against the fourth-instar larvae of A. subpitcus and C. quinquefasciatus,
      respectively. The purified compound gymnemagenol was tested in concentrations of 
      80, 40, 20, 10 and 5 ppm, and the per cent mortality were 100, 72, 53, 30 and 15 
      against A. subpitcus and 100, 89, 61, 42 and 30 against C. quinquefasciatus,
      respectively. The larvicidal crude leaf extract of G. sylvestre showed the
      highest mortality in the concentration of 1,000 ppm against the larvae of A.
      subpictus (LC(50) = 166.28 ppm, r (2) = 0.807) and against the larvae of C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 186.55 ppm, r (2) = 0.884), respectively. The maximum 
      efficacy was observed in gymnemagenol compound with LC(50) and r (2) values
      against the larvae of A. subpictus (22.99 ppm, 0.922) and against C.
      quinquefasciatus (15.92 ppm, 0.854), respectively. The control (distilled water) 
      showed nil mortality in the concurrent assay.

TI  - Efficacy of Advanced Odomos repellent cream (N, N-diethyl-benzamide) against
      mosquito vectors.
PG  - 426-30
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Repellents are commonly used personal protection
      measures to avoid mosquito bites. In the present study, Advanced Odomos cream
      (12% N, N-diethyl-benzamide) was tested for its efficacy against mosquitoes in
      comparison to DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methyl benzamide). METHODS: Bioassays were
      conducted to assess the repellency of Advanced Odomos and DEET creams against
      Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti. Their efficacy was tested on human
      volunteers applied with different concentrations of test creams ranging from 1 to
      12 mg/cm 2 and by exposing them to mosquitoes at hourly intervals. Field
      evaluation was also carried out to test the duration of protection of the test
      creams against Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes during whole night and day time
      collections, respectively on human volunteers. Mosquito collections were done
      using torch light and aspirator. RESULTS: Complete (100%) protection was achieved
      at 10 mg/cm 2 cream formulation of Advanced Odomos (1.2 mg a.i/cm 2 ) dose
      against An. stephensi and 12 mg/cm 2 (1.44 mg a.i./cm 2 ) against Ae. aegypti on 
      human baits. There was no statistically significant differences in per cent
      protection against mosquito bites between Advanced Odomos and DEET cream (P>0.05)
      in respective doses. Complete protection up to 11 h was observed against
      Anopheles mosquitoes during whole night collections and up to 6 h against Ae.
      aegypti in day time collections. No adverse reactions such as itching,
      irritation, vomiting, nausea, etc. were reported by the volunteers.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Advanced Odomos cream applied at 10 mg/cm 2
      concentration provided 100% protection from Anopheles mosquitoes up to 11 h
      whereas about 6 h protection was recorded against Ae. aegypti. The laboratory and
      field trials indicate that for longer protection against Anopheles mosquitoes 10 
      mg/cm 2 will be appropriate and in case of Ae. aegypti more than 10 mg/cm 2
      application is required for complete protection. In conclusion, the Advanced
      Odomos cream was comparable to the known repellent cream DEET for prolonged
      protection against malaria and dengue vectors.

TI  - Copper nanoparticles synthesized by polyol process used to control hematophagous 
      parasites.
PG  - 1403-15
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2387-3 [doi]
AB  - The present study was based on assessments of the anti-parasitic activities of
      the hematophagous (blood feeding) larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus
      Grassi, filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus, Say (Diptera: Culicidae), and 
      the larvae of cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Canestrini (Acari:
      Ixodidae). The metallic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) synthesized by polyol
      process from copper acetate as precursor and Tween 80 were used as both the
      medium and the stabilizing reagent. The efficacy of synthesized Cu NPs was tested
      against the larvae of blood-sucking parasites. UV-vis spectra characterization
      was performed, and peak was observed at 575 nm, which is the characteristic to
      the surface plasmon bond of Cu NPs. The strong surface plasmon absorption band
      observed at 575 nm may be due to the formation of non-oxidized Cu NPs. X-ray
      diffraction (XRD) spectral data showed concentric rings corresponding to the
      26.79 (111), 34.52 (200), and 70.40 (220) reflections. XRD spectrum of the copper
      nanoparticles exhibited 2theta values corresponding to the copper nanocrystal. No
      peaks of impurities are observed in XRD data. The scanning electron micrograph
      (SEM) showed structures of irregular polygonal, cylindrical shape, and the size
      range was found to be 35-80 nm. The size of the Cu NPs was measured by atomic
      force microscope (AFM) in non-contact mode. For imaging by AFM, the sample was
      suspended in acetone and spins coated on a silicon wafer. The line profile image 
      was drawn by the XEI software and the horizontal line at 6 mum on a 2D AFM image.
      Research has demonstrated that metallic nanoparticles produce toxicity in aquatic
      organisms that is due largely to effects of particulates as opposed to release of
      dissolved ions. Copper acetate solution tested against the parasite larvae
      exposed to varying concentrations and the larval mortality was observed for 24 h.
      The larval percent mortality observed in synthesized Cu NPs were 36, 49, 75,
      93,100; 32, 53, 63, 73, and 100 and 36, 47, 69, 88, 100 at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0,
      and 8.0 mg/L against A. subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus and R. microplus,
      respectively. The larval percent mortality shown in copper acetate solution were 
      16, 45, 57, 66 and 100, 37, 58, 83, 87, and 100 and 41, 59, 79, 100, and 100 at
      10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/L against A. subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus, and R.
      microplus, respectively. The maximum efficacy was observed in Cu NPs and copper
      acetate solution against the larvae of A. subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus, and R. 
      microplus with LC(50) and r (2) values of 0.95 and 23.47, 1.01 and 15.24, and
      1.06 and 14.14 mg/L with r (2) = 0.766; 0.957 and 0.908; 0.946; and 0.816 and
      0.945, respectively. The control (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the
      concurrent assay. The chi-square value was significant at p </= 0.05 level. This 
      is the first report on anti-parasitic activity of the synthesized Cu NPs and
      copper acetate solution.

AB  - The populations of Anopheles fluviatilis James (1902), a foothill vector,
      collected from village Tilpuri of district Udham Singh Nagar and from villages
      Auspur, Ismailpur, and Durgapur of district Hardwar were maintained at National
      Institute of Malaria Research Insectory at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and 80-85% RH.
      Anopheles fluviatilis sensu lato was identified for two sibling species T and U. 
      A total of 94% of the females of both species T and U oviposited by day 4 after
      the blood meal. Maximum hatching, that is, 80 and 62% of the eggs of species T
      and U, was observed on the second and third day, respectively. For species T,
      mortality in second and third instars was recorded to be 144 +/- 9 (N = 1,600)
      and 48 +/- 6 (N = 1,200), whereas in species U, it was 196 +/- 13 (N = 1,400) and
      70 +/- 8 (N = 1,000), respectively. Mortalities in second instars of species T
      and U were significantly higher than third instars (P = 0.05). The female and
      male ratio in pupal stage of species T and U was found to be 53:47 and 58:42,
      respectively.

TI  - The mosquitocidal activity of methanolic extracts of Lantana cramera root and
      Anacardium occidentale leaf: role of glutathione S-transferase in insecticide
      resistance.
PG  - 291-5
AB  - Larvicidal activity of methanolic plant extracts of Lantana cramera (P1) root and
      Anacardium occidentale (P2) leaf was investigated against the larvae of the three
      mosquito species (Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti 
      reared in the laboratory), and the respective glutathione S-transferase (GST)
      activity was analyzed as an index of protection against the extracts. The LC50
      (extract concentration that shows 50% mortality) values of P1 extract for An.
      stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus were 132.55, 27.82, and 11.68
      ppm, respectively, whereas those of P2 extract were 56.81, 912, and 10.79 ppm,
      respectively. In general, in the untreated groups, the level of GST activity was 
      significantly higher in Ae. aegypti in comparison with An. stephesi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. However, the enzyme activity failed to show any response when
      treated with either of the plant extracts in Ae. aegypti. However, an increase in
      the GST activity was recorded in extract-treated larvae of both An. stephensi and
      Cx. quinquefasciatus. The results of the current study suggest that both the
      plant extracts show species-specific mosquitocidal potential. Induction of GST
      activities in survived An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae suggests the
      role of this enzyme in conferring resistance to the plant extracts.

TI  - Parasite killing in malaria non-vector mosquito Anopheles culicifacies species B:
      implication of nitric oxide synthase upregulation.
PG  - e18400
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies, the main vector of human malaria in rural
      India, is a complex of five sibling species. Despite being phylogenetically
      related, a naturally selected subgroup species B of this sibling species complex 
      is found to be a poor vector of malaria. We have attempted to understand the
      differences between vector and non-vector Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes in
      terms of transcriptionally activated nitric oxide synthase (AcNOS) physiologies
      to elucidate the mechanism of refractoriness. Identification of the differences
      between genes and gene products that may impart refractory phenotype can
      facilitate development of novel malaria transmission blocking strategies.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a study on phylogenetically related 
      susceptible (species A) and refractory (species B) sibling species of An.
      culicifacies mosquitoes to characterize biochemical and molecular differences in 
      AcNOS gene and gene elements and their ability to inhibit oocyst growth. We
      demonstrate that in species B, AcNOS specific activity and nitrite/nitrates in
      mid-guts and haemolymph were higher as compared to species A after invasion of
      the mid-gut by P. vivax at the beginning and during the course of blood feeding. 
      Semiquantitative RT-PCR and real time PCR data of AcNOS concluded that this gene 
      is more abundantly expressed in midgut of species B than in species A and is
      transcriptionally upregulated post blood meals. Dietary feeding of L-NAME along
      with blood meals significantly inhibited midgut AcNOS activity leading to an
      increase in oocyst production in An. culicifacies species B.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesize that upregulation of mosquito innate
      cytotoxicity due to NOS in refractory strain to Plasmodium vivax infection may
      contribute to natural refractoriness in An. culicifacies mosquito population.
      This innate capacity of refractory mosquitoes could represent the ancestral
      function of the mosquito immune system against the parasite and could be utilized
      to understand the molecular basis of refractoriness in planning effective vector 
      control strategies.

TI  - Mosquitocidal properties of nereistoxin against Anopheles stephensi, Aedes
      aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 1107-12
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2353-0 [doi]
AB  - Emergence of resistance among mosquitoes is a recent problem. Safe and
      eco-friendly agents from biological origins are the need of the hour.
      Nereistoxin, a naturally occurring substance, was first isolated from the marine 
      annelid Lumbriconereis heteropoda and stored in the freezer. In the present
      study, the toxicity of nereistoxin was evaluated against vector mosquitoes. The
      larvicidal, ovicidal and adulticidal activities of nereistoxin were assayed for
      their toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The
      nereistoxin was inversely proportional to the concentration and directly
      proportional to the mosquitoes. The larvicidal activity after 24 h LC(50) value
      was observed at 0.467, 0.535 and 0.601 ppm for A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C.
      quinquefasciatus, respectively. The ovicidal activity after 120 h zero percentage
      of egg hatchability was observed at a concentration of 0.8 ppm for A. stephensi
      and 1.0 ppm for A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. The results of the
      adulticidal activity after 24 h LD(50) value were observed at 0.022, 0.028 and
      0.034 ppm for A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The
      extracted nereistoxin was characterized and identified by ultraviolet, infrared, 
      nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectroscopic methods and high pressure liquid
      chromatography. These results clearly reveal that the nereistoxin served as a
      potential larvicidal, ovicidal and adulticidal activity against vector
      mosquitoes.

TI  - The logic of location: malaria research in colonial India, Darjeeling and
      Duars,1900-30.
PG  - 183-202
AB  - This article explores the scientific and entrepreneurial incentives for malaria
      research in the tea plantations of north Bengal in colonial India. In the process
      it highlights how the logic of 'location' emerged as the central trope through
      which medical experts, as well as colonial administrators and planters, defined
      malaria research in the region. The paper argues that the 'local' emerged as both
      a prerequisite of colonial governance as well as a significant component of
      malaria research in the field. Despite the ambiguities that such a project
      entailed, tropical medicine was enriched from a diverse understanding of local
      ecology, habitation, and structural modes of production. Nevertheless, the
      locality itself did not benefit from anti-malarial policy undertaken either by
      medical experts or the colonial state. This article suggests that there was a
      disjuncture between 'tropical medicine' and its 'field' that could not be
      accommodated within the colonial plantation system.

AB  - Larvicides play a vital role in controlling mosquitoes in their breeding sites.
      The present study was carried out to establish the larvicidal activities of
      mycosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against vectors: Aedes aegypti and
      Anopheles stephensi responsible for diseases of public health importance. The
      AgNPs synthesized by filamentous fungus Cochliobolus lunatus, characterized by
      UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray
      diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. 
      The characterization studies confirmed the spherical shape and size (3-21 nm) of 
      silver nanoparticles. The efficacy of mycosynthesized AgNPs at all the tested
      concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, and 0.3125 ppm) against second, third,
      and fourth instar larvae of A. aegypti (LC(50) 1.29, 1.48, and 1.58; LC(90) 3.08,
      3.33, and 3.41 ppm) and against A. stephensi (LC(50) 1.17, 1.30, and 1.41; LC(90)
      2.99, 3.13, and 3.29 ppm) were observed, respectively. The mortality rates were
      positively correlated with the concentration of AgNPs. Significant (P < 0.05)
      changes in the larval mortality was also recorded between the period of exposure 
      against fourth instar larvae of A. aegypti and A. stephensi. The possible
      larvicidal activity may be due to penetration of nanoparticles through membrane. 
      Toxicity studies carried out against non-target fish species Poecilia reticulata,
      the most common organism in the habitats of A. aegypti and A. stephensi showed no
      toxicity at LC50 and LC90 doses of the AgNPs. This is the first report on
      mosquito larvicidal activity of mycosynthesized nanoparticles. Thus, the use of
      fungus C. lunatus to synthesize silver nanoparticles is a rapid, eco-friendly,
      and a single-step approach and the AgNps formed can be potential mosquito
      larvicidal agents.

AB  - Microbial control agents offer alternatives to chemical pest control as they can 
      be more selective than chemical insecticides. The present study evaluates the
      mosquito larvicidal potential of microbial pigment prodigiosin produced by
      Serratia marcescens NMCC46 against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. The
      pigment of S. marcescens NMCC46 was extracted after 24 h from mannitol containing
      nutrient broth media. The effects of crude extracted pigment on the growth,
      survival, development, and other life cycle aspects were studied. The LC(50) and 
      LC(90) values of second, third, and fourth instars of A. aegypti (LC(50) = 41.65,
      139.51, 103.95; LC(90) = 117.81, 213.68, 367.82) and A. stephensi (LC(50) =
      51.12, 105.52, 133.07; LC(90) = 134.81, 204.45, 285.35) were determined. At
      higher concentration (500 ppm), mortality starts within first 6 h of exposure.
      More than 50% mortality occurs within the first 24 h. The overall observed
      effects against A. aegypti and A. stephensi larvae after 48 h were increasing
      percent survival larvae, survival pupation, adult emergence with decreasing crude
      pigment extract concentration. These ensure that the resultant mosquito
      population reduction is substantial even where the larvicidal potential is
      minimal. The UV (lambda (max) = 536 nm), TLC (Rf = 0.9), HPLC, and FTIR analysis 
      of crude pigment shows the presence of prodigiosin as active compound. Thus, the 
      active compound produced by this species would be more useful against vectors
      responsible for diseases of public health importance. This is the first report on
      mosquito larvicidal activity of prodigiosin produced by Serratia species.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the larvicidal and pupicidal potential of the methanolic
      extracts from Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) plant seeds against malarial vector 
      Anopheles stephensi (A. stephensi) mosquitoes at different concentrations (20,
      40, 60, 80 and 100 ppm). METHODS: M. oleifera was collected from the area of
      around Bharathiar University, Coimbatore. The dried plant materials were powdered
      by an electrical blender. From each sample, 100 g of the plant material were
      extracted with 300 mL of methanol for 8 h in a Soxhlet apparatus. The extracts
      were evaporated to dryness in rotary vacuum evaporator to yield 122 mg and 110 mg
      of dark greenish material (residue) from Arcang amara and Ocimum basilicum,
      respectively. One gram of the each plant residue was dissolved separately in 100 
      mL of acetone (stock solution) from which different concentrations, i.e., 20, 40,
      60, 80 and 100 ppm were prepared. RESULTS: Larvicidal activity of M. oleifera
      exhibited in the first to fourth instar larvae of the A. stephensi, and the LC50 
      and LC90 values were 57.79 ppm and 125.93 ppm for the first instar, 63.90 ppm and
      133.07 ppm for the second instar, 72.45 ppm and 139.82 ppm for the third instar, 
      78.93 ppm and 143.20 ppm for the fourth instar, respectively. During the pupal
      stage the methanolic extract of M. oleifera showed that the LC50 and LC90 values 
      were 67.77 ppm and 141.00 ppm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      indicates that the phytochemicals derived from M. oleifera seeds extracts are
      effective mosquito vector control agents and the plant extracts may be used for
      further integrated pest management programs.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In this study, larvicidal activity of
      synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing aqueous extract from Eclipta
      prostrata, a member of the Asteraceae was investigated against fourth instar
      larvae of filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus say and malaria vector,
      Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae). The synthesized AgNPs
      characterized by UV-vis spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and
      X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM analyses of the synthesized AgNPs were clearly
      distinguishable measured 35-60 nm in size. Larvae were exposed to varying
      concentrations of aqueous extract of synthesized AgNPs for 24h. The maximum
      efficacy was observed in crude aqueous, and synthesized AgNPs against C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50)=27.49 and 4.56 mg/L; LC(90)=70.38 and 13.14 mg/L), and
      against A. subpictus (LC(50)=27.85 and 5.14 mg/L; LC(90)=71.45 and 25.68 mg/L)
      respectively. The chi-square value were significant at p<0.05 level. These
      results suggest that the synthesized AgNPs have the potential to be used as an
      ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the Culex tritaeniorhynchus and A.
      subpictus. This method is considered as a new approach to control vectors.
      Therefore, this study provides first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity
      of synthesized AgNPs against vectors.

TI  - Field evaluation of lambda-cyhalothrin (ICON 10 CS) indoor residual spraying
      against Anopheles culicifacies in India.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Field trials of lambda-cyhalothrin 10 CS (ICON 10 CS) in
      indoor residual spraying (IRS) with 25 mg a.i./m2 against Anopheles culicifacies 
      was undertaken vs malathion IRS (25% WP-2 g a.i./m2) in Tumkur district,
      Karnataka; vs deltamethrin IRS (2.5% WP-20 mg a.i./m2) in Dharmapuri district;
      and vs lambda-cyhalothrin (10 WP-25 mg a.i./m2) in Ramanathapuram district, Tamil
      Nadu, India. METHODS: Spray operations in the experimental villages were done by 
      the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) and in the control villages by 
      the respective State Health Department staff. Persistence of efficacy of
      insecticide sprayed in villages was assessed by contact bioassays against vector 
      mosquitoes. Entomological indicators such as per structure density, parity rates 
      of vector mosquitoes and sporozoite rates were measured in all the three study
      areas using standard procedures. Mass blood surveys and active fever case
      detections were carried out in experimental and control villages to study the
      impact of IRS on malaria transmission. RESULTS: Persistence of effectiveness of
      ICON 10 CS was observed up to 2-3 months in all the three study areas. ICON 10 CS
      was found effective at par with or better than the insecticides used in the
      national programme in reducing the mosquito densities and in interrupting malaria
      transmission in the study villages. Vector density, parity rates and malaria
      cases considerably reduced in the ICON 10 CS-sprayed villages. CONCLUSION: Field 
      trials at three sites have established that ICON 10 CS formulation was relatively
      more effective than malathion 25% WP, deltamethrin 2.5% WP and lambda-cyhalothrin

      a malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and PCR assays for their detection.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-59 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects, resulting from mutation(s) in 
      the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene is one of the mechanisms of
      resistance against DDT and pyrethroid-group of insecticides. The most common
      mutation(s) associated with knockdown resistance in insects, including
      anophelines, has been reported to be present at residue Leu1014 in the IIS6
      transmembrane segment of the vgsc gene. This study reports the presence of two
      alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014S and L1014F, at this residue in a major
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and describes new PCR assays for their
      detection. METHODS: Part of the vgsc (IIS4-S5 linker-to-IIS6 transmembrane
      segment) of An. stephensi collected from Alwar (Rajasthan, India) was
      PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, sequenced and analysed for the presence of
      deduced amino acid substitution(s). RESULTS: Analysis of DNA sequences revealed
      the presence of two alternative non-synonymous point mutations at L1014 residue
      in the IIS6 transmembrane segment of vgsc, i.e., T>C mutation on the second
      position and A>T mutation on the third position of the codon, leading to Leu
      (TTA)-to-Ser (TCA) and -Phe (TTT) amino acid substitutions, respectively.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed for identification of each 
      of these two point mutations. Genotyping of An. stephensi mosquitoes from Alwar
      by PCR assays revealed the presence of both mutations, with a high frequency of
      L1014S. The PCR assays developed for detection of the kdr mutations were specific
      as confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR-genotyped samples. CONCLUSIONS: Two
      alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014S and L1014F, were detected in An. stephensi
      with a high allelic frequency of L1014S. The occurrence of L1014S is being
      reported for the first time in An. stephensi. Two specific PCR assays were
      developed for detection of two kdr-like mutations in An. stephensi.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium vivax in a hyperendemic area predominated by
      Plasmodium falciparum; a preliminary study.
PG  - 578-84
AB  - Understanding the genetic diversity, extent and distribution of variant forms of 
      Plasmodium vivax parasites is crucial in the development of effective control
      measures and in Orissa, a hyperendemic state in the eastern part of India, the
      polymorphic nature of P. vivax isolates is largely lacking. The result of the
      study analyzing two highly polymorphic single copy genes for P. vivax
      circumsporozoite protein (pvcs) and P. vivax merozoite surface protein 3alpha
      (pvmsp3alpha) shows that the parasite population is highly heterogenous (33
      distinct genotype from 35 isolates) in Orissa. However, the observation of the
      multiplicity of infection value of 1.34 and high frequency distribution of
      certain genotype with respect to individual marker (the VK247b allele with a
      frequency of 0.37; VK210e with 0.25 and VK210c with 0.14) suggests that the
      parasite population are likely to be under selective pressure and may either be
      due to preferential production of sporozoites carrying these variants in the
      available anopheline mosquito species of the state or selection of particular
      genotypes by host immune pressure. Moreover, although P. vivax in South-East Asia
      indicates an overall predominance of VK210 which is thought to be the best
      adapted variant of pvcs repeat type, the almost equal prevalence of both repeat
      type of pvcs; VK210 and VK247 in the present study is unexpected and needs
      further study for clarification.

TI  - Effects of Andrographis paniculata Nees on growth, development and reproduction
      of malarial vector Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 509-16
AB  - The use of environment friendly and easily biodegradable natural insecticides of 
      plant origin has received progressively more attention as insecticide
      alternatives for the control of medically important mosquito vectors. The ethanol
      and methanol extracts of Andrographis paniculata Nees were evaluated for its
      effects on growth, development and reproduction of malarial vector Anopheles
      stephensi Liston. After 8 days of treatment, 88.60 and 85.25% of the larvae
      treated at 35p.p.m. failed to emerge in ethanol and methanol extracts
      respectively. In addition, the duration of larval instars and the total
      development time were prolonged, while female longevity and fecundity were
      markedly decreased. The suppression of pupation and adult emergence was probably 
      due to juvenile hormone analog similarities in combination with growth regulators
      and toxicity, which reduced the overall performance of the malaria vector An.
      stephensi.

TI  - Mosquito biodiversity of Dibru-Saikhowa biosphere reserve in Assam, India.
PG  - 695-9
AB  - Entomological surveys were conducted for three consecutive years in core and
      buffer zone of the Dibru-Saikhowa biosphere reserve in pre monsoon, monsoon and
      post-monsoon seasons. A total of 52 species of mosquitoes under eleven genera
      have been detected. The genus Anopheles (18 species) was the predominant followed
      by Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Armigeres, Mimomyia, Ochlerostatus, Malaya,
      Toxorhynchites, Ficalbia and Aedeomyia. The buffer zone of the forest reserve
      where human habitations are there exhibited the presence of maximum number of
      species (49 species under 10 genera) in comparison to core zone (42 species under
      10 genera). In buffer zone, maximum numbers of species (38) were recorded in
      monsoon season followed by post- monsoon (35 species) and Pre-monsoon season (34 
      species). Whereas in core zone, maximum number of species were collected in post 
      monsoon season followed by pre monsoon season and monsoon season. In Core and
      buffer zone, the maximum species were recorded from the ground pool habitat and
      slow flowing stream respectively. Among the disease vectors, the potential
      Japanese encephalitis vectors incriminated in India were very much prevalent.
      This study provides the list of available mosquito species recorded for the first
      time in the Dibru-Saikhowa biosphere reserve.

      malaria vector Anopheles subpictus Grassi.
PG  - 715-26
LID - 10.1007/s00436-011-2306-7 [doi]
AB  - This no-choice, laboratory study focuses on the feeding of homogeneous powdered, 
      dried, yeast with different plant extracts on mosquito fourth-instar larvae to
      determine the effects on their mortality. Screening for antifeedant activity of
      plant extracts with some known medicinal attributes could lead to the discovery
      of new agents for vector control. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      antifeedant activity of crude leaf hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol
      extracts of Andrographis lineata Wallich ex Nees. (Acanthaceae), Anisomeles
      malabarica (L.) Sims. (Lamiaceae), Argemone mexicana L. (Papaveraceae),
      Aristolochia bracteolata Lam. (Aristolochiaceae), Chrysanthemum indium L.
      (Asteraceae), Datura metal L. (Solanaceae), Eclipta prostrata L. (Asteraceae),
      and Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Pers. (Fibaceae) against the fourth-instar larvae
      of Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera:Culicidae). All the crude extracts showed 
      antifeedant activity in a dose-dependent manner. The plant extracts exhibited a
      significant antifeedant activity after 24 and 48 h of exposure; however, the
      highest larval mortality was found in leaf ethyl acetate extract of A.
      malabarica, acetone extract E. prostrata, methanol extract of A. lineata, C.
      indium, and S. grandiflora after 24 h (LC(50) = 2.53, 2.82, 2.31, 2.56, and 2.08 
      mg/mL; LC(90) = 6.40, 8.06, 7.45, 6.98, and 6.20 mg/mL), respectively. The hexane
      extract of A. lineata, D. metal, methanol extract of A. bracteolata and E.
      prostrata showed larval mortality after 48 h (LC(50) = 3.05, 2.11, 3.00, and 2.18
      mg/mL; LC(90) = 9.06, 6.22, 8.23, and 5.77 mg/mL), respectively. One hundred
      percent larval mortality was observed in methanol extract of A. lineata, and C.
      indium after 24 h and the hexane extract of A. lineata and D. metal after 48 h at
      10 mg/100 mL. The methanol extracts of A. lineata and C. indium significantly
      increased larval mortality in comparison to larvae fed with untreated diet.
      Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis is widely accepted as a biological
      pesticide because of its highly specific activity against dipteran insects
      without adverse effects on other organisms. The feeding deterrent activity of
      different herbal extracts against the larvae of malaria vector A. subpictus
      exhibited significantly lower toxicity compare with the bio larvicides, B.
      thuringiensis. These results suggest that the methanol extract of A. lineata, C. 
      indium, the hexane extract of A. lineata and D. metal have the potential to be
      used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the medically important
      vector A. subpictus. These findings corroborate traditional insecticidal
      application of selected plants and the results can be extended for the control of
      mosquitoes.

      ZnO NPs were 43% at 1 h, 64% at 3 h, 78% at 6 h, and 100% after 12 h against R.
      microplus activity. In pediculocidal activity, the results showed that the
      optimal times for measuring mortality effects of synthesized ZnO NPs were 38% at 
      10 min, 71% at 30 min, 83% at 1 h, and 100% after 6 h against P. humanus capitis.
      One hundred percent lice mortality was observed at 10 mg/L treated for 6 h. The
      mortality was confirmed after 24 h of observation period. The larval mortality
      effects of synthesized ZnO NPs were 37%, 72%, 100% and 43%, 78% and 100% at 6,
      12, and 24 h against A. subpictus and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. It is
      apparent that the small size and corresponding large specific surface area of
      small nanometer-scale ZnO particles impose several effects that govern its
      parasitic action, which are size dependent. ZnO NPs were synthesized by wet
      chemical process, and it was characterized with the UV showing peak at 361 nm.
      X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra clearly shows that the diffraction peaks in the
      pattern indexed as the zinc oxide with lattice constants a = 3.249 and c = 5.206 
      A. The FTIR spectrum showed the range of 400-4,000 cm(-1). The band at 899.56
      cm(-1); 1,151.87 cm(-1); 1,396 cm(-1); and these bands showed the complete
      composition of ZnO NPs. SEM micrograph showed 60-120-nm size and aggregates of
      spherical shape nanoparticles. EDX showed the complete chemical composition of
      the synthesized nanoparticles of zinc oxide. The maximum efficacy was observed in
      zinc oxide against the R. microplus, P. humanus capitis, and the larvae of A.
      subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus with LC(50) values of 29.14, 11.80, 11.14, and
      12.39 mg/L; r (2) = 0.805, 0.876, 0.894, and 0.904, respectively. The synthesized
      ZnO NPs showed the LC(50) and r (2) values against the R. microplus (13.41 mg/L; 
      0.982), P. humanus capitis (11.80 mg/L; 0.966), and the larvae of A. subpictus
      (3.19; 0.945 mg/L), against C. quinquefasciatus (4.87 mg/L; 0.970), respectively.
      The control (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the concurrent assay. This 
      is the first report on anti-parasitic activity of the synthesized ZnO NPs.

TI  - Malaria epidemiology along Indo-Bangladesh border in Tripura State, India.
PG  - 1279-89
AB  - Malaria epidemiological surveys were conducted in 16 villages along the
      Indo-Bangladesh border in Tripura, northeastern India. Insecticide resistance
      among malaria vectors and chloroquine resistance in the parasite were also
      studied along with monitoring of vector density using light traps. The
      epidemiological data indicated that malaria incidence was highest during
      June-July and lowest during November. Examination of blood smears collected
      through door to door surveys indicated slide positivity rate (SPR) of 25.2% and
      that Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite (slide falciparum rate of
      22.3%). The incidence rates of falciparum malaria varied significantly among the 
      age groups (p<0.001) and 2-4 year olds were the most affected. Major malaria
      vectors recorded in light trap collections were An. dirus, An. minimus and An.
      philippinensis/nivipes. Chloroquine resistance studies indicated that treatment
      failure occurred in 35% of the cases and hence the use of artesunate combination 
      therapy (ACT) was recommended for treatment of malaria in the area.

TI  - Patent literature on mosquito repellent inventions which contain plant essential 
      oils--a review.
PG  - 598-617
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1270723 [doi]
AB  - Bites Bites of mosquitoes belonging to the genera Anopheles Meigen, Aedes Meigen,
      Culex L. and Haemagogus L. are a general nuisance and are responsible for the
      transmission of important tropical diseases such as malaria, hemorrhagic dengue
      and yellow fevers and filariasis (elephantiasis). Plants are traditional sources 
      of mosquito repelling essential oils (EOs), glyceridic oils and repellent and
      synergistic chemicals. A Chemical Abstracts search on mosquito repellent
      inventions containing plant-derived EOs revealed 144 active patents mostly from
      Asia. Chinese, Japanese and Korean language patents and those of India (in
      English) accounted for roughly 3/4 of all patents. Since 1998 patents on
      EO-containing mosquito repellent inventions have almost doubled about every 4
      years. In general, these patents describe repellent compositions for use in
      topical agents, cosmetic products, incense, fumigants, indoor and outdoor sprays,
      fibers, textiles among other applications. 67 EOs and 9 glyceridic oils were
      individually cited in at least 2 patents. Over 1/2 of all patents named just one 
      EO. Citronella [Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle, C.winterianus Jowitt ex Bor] and
      eucalyptus (Eucalyptus L'Her. spp.) EOs were each cited in approximately 1/3 of
      all patents. Camphor [Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl], cinnamon (Cinnamomum
      zeylanicum Blume), clove [Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M. Perry], geranium 
      (Pelargonium graveolens L'Her.), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), lemon
      [Citrus x limon (L.) Osbeck], lemongrass [Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf] and
      peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) EOs were each cited in > 10% of patents.
      Repellent chemicals present in EO compositions or added as pure "natural"
      ingredients such as geraniol, limonene, p-menthane-3,8-diol, nepetalactone and
      vanillin were described in approximately 40% of all patents. About 25% of
      EO-containing inventions included or were made to be used with synthetic insect
      control agents having mosquito repellent properties such as pyrethroids,
      N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), (+/-)-p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and dialkyl
      phthalates. Synergistic effects involving one or more EOs and synthetic and/or
      natural components were claimed in about 10% of all patents. Scientific
      literature sources provide evidence for the mosquito repellency of many of the
      EOs and individual chemical components found in EOs used in patented repellent
      inventions.

      Culicidae).
PG  - 353-67

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases have an economic impact, including loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates; 
      however, no part of the world is free from vector-borne diseases. In mosquito
      control programs, botanical origin may have the potential to be used successfully
      as eggs, larvae, and adult. The larvicidal, ovicidal, and repellent activities of
      crude benzene and ethyl acetate extracts of leaf of Ervatamia coronaria and
      Caesalpinia pulcherrima were assayed for their toxicity against three important
      vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was observed after 24
      h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the
      highest larval mortality was found in benzene extract of E. coronaria against the
      larvae of Anopheles Stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus with the
      LC(50) and LC(90) values were 79.08, 89.59, and 96.15 ppm and 150.47, 166.04, and
      174.10 ppm, respectively. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was 
      observed 48 h posttreatment. The percent hatchability was inversely proportional 
      to the concentration of extract and directly proportional to the eggs. The leaf
      extract of E. coronaria was found to be most effective than Caesalpinia
      pulcherrima against eggs/egg rafts of three vector mosquitoes. For E. coronaria, 
      the benzene extract exerted 300, 250, and 200 ppm against Anopheles stephensi,
      Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus, respectively. The results of the
      repellent activity of benzene and ethyl acetate extract of E. coronaria and
      Caesalpinia pulcherrima plants at three different concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, and
      5.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of fore arm in man and exposed against adult
      female mosquitoes. In this observation, these two plant crude extracts gave
      protection against mosquito bites without any allergic reaction to the test
      person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent on the strength of the
      plant extracts. These results suggest that the leaf solvent plant extracts have
      the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of
      mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal, ovicidal, and
      repellent activities of the reported E. coronaria and Caesalpinia pulcherrima
      plants.

TI  - Epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Central India, an area where
      chloroquine has been replaced by artemisinin-based combination therapy.
PG  - 133-9
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2010.11.002 [doi]
AB  - India contributes greatly to the global incidence of malaria. The factors
      influencing malaria in India are highly diverse and vary greatly from the
      epidemiological setting of any other country. Central India is the most
      vulnerable area to malaria in India. This study was carried out in three
      community health centres in Dindori District, Madhya Pradesh (Central India).
      Dindori District is mesoendemic for malaria, with both Plasmodium falciparum and 
      P. vivax being present in all age groups. Anopheles culicifacies and A.
      fluviatilis are highly efficient vectors of malaria. In this study, an epidemic
      of malaria among indigenous ethnic group Baigas was investigated to determine the
      causes of the epidemic and the population involved in order to aid in disease
      containment. The existence of sporozoite-positive A. culicifacies and A.
      fluviatilis indicates either that spraying had not been done properly or the
      presence of insecticide resistance. A combination of factors propagated the
      epidemic. Evidence suggests that the non-availability of artemisinin-based
      combination therapy and rapid diagnostic tests along with an immunogenically
      vulnerable population each played an important role. As the global prevalence of 
      malaria decreases owing to initiatives to control or eliminate the disease, more 
      areas will become mesoendemic or hypoendemic for malaria. Detection and control
      of epidemics requires greater attention, and mechanisms to ensure the quality of 
      interventions are essential.

TI  - Chlorfenapyr: a new insecticide with novel mode of action can control pyrethroid 
      resistant malaria vectors.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-10-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria vectors have acquired widespread resistance to many of the
      currently used insecticides, including synthetic pyrethroids. Hence, there is an 
      urgent need to develop alternative insecticides for effective management of
      insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. In the present study, chlorfenapyr was
      evaluated against Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi for its possible
      use in vector control. METHODS: Efficacy of chlorfenapyr against An. culicifacies
      and An. stephensi was assessed using adult bioassay tests. In the laboratory,
      determination of diagnostic dose, assessment of residual activity on different
      substrates, cross-resistance pattern with different insecticides and potentiation
      studies using piperonyl butoxide were undertaken by following standard
      procedures. Potential cross-resistance patterns were assessed on field
      populations of An. culicifacies. RESULTS: A dose of 5.0% chlorfenapyr was
      determined as the diagnostic concentration for assessing susceptibility applying 
      the WHO tube test method in anopheline mosquitoes with 2 h exposure and 48 h
      holding period. The DDT-resistant/malathion-deltamethrin-susceptible strain of
      An. culicifacies species C showed higher LD50 and LD99 (0.67 and 2.39%
      respectively) values than the DDT-malathion-deltamethrin susceptible An.
      culicifacies species A (0.41 and 2.0% respectively) and An. stephensi strains
      (0.43 and 2.13% respectively) and there was no statistically significant
      difference in mortalities among the three mosquito species tested (p > 0.05).
      Residual activity of chlorfenapyr a.i. of 400 mg/m2 on five fabricated
      substrates, namely wood, mud, mud+lime, cement and cement + distemper was found
      to be effective up to 24 weeks against An. culicifacies and up to 34 weeks
      against An. stephensi. No cross-resistance to DDT, malathion, bendiocarb and
      deltamethrin was observed with chlorfenapyr in laboratory-reared strains of An.
      stephensi and field-caught An. culicifacies. Potentiation studies demonstrated
      the antagonistic effect of PBO. CONCLUSION: Laboratory studies with susceptible
      and resistant strains of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi, coupled with limited
      field studies with multiple insecticide-resistant An. culicifacies have shown
      that chlorfenapyr can be a suitable insecticide for malaria vector control, in
      multiple-insecticide-resistant mosquitoes especially in areas with pyrethroid
      resistant mosquitoes.

TI  - Multilocus nuclear DNA markers and genetic parameters in an Indian Anopheles
      minimus population.
PG  - 572-9
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2011.01.001 [doi]
AB  - Estimation of population genetic parameters is highly dependent on the choice of 
      genetic markers. Furthermore, inferences based on single genes could lead to
      erroneous conclusions and population genetic outcomes, thus usage of multiple
      loci is suggested. Considering malaria is a highly fatal vector-borne infectious 
      disease, inference on population genetic structure and demography could be of
      help in the long run for malaria vector management and control. Using the
      published genome sequence information of Anopheles gambiae we designed EPIC
      primers to amplify DNA fragments in An. minimus nuclear genome. Eight such DNA
      fragments could be successfully amplified and sequenced and homology to
      corresponding genes of An. gambiae was established. All the eight DNA fragments
      were found to be polymorphic for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a
      population sample of An. minimus from India. Several tests of neutrality
      confirmed that all the eight fragments evolve under a standard neutral model of
      molecular evolution. Furthermore, multilocus linkage disequilibrium studies
      revealed that the DNA fragments were not genetically linked to each other and
      thus are independently evolving. Tests of past population demographic events
      clearly revealed that this Indian population of An. minimus follows demographic
      equilibrium model, without any significant recent population bottleneck or
      expansion. The eight multilocus nuclear DNA fragments thus could be considered as
      'putatively neutral' and be used to infer population structure and demographic
      history of An. minimus, a major malaria vector in the Southeast Asia and India.
      Moreover, the estimations of population demography using these putatively neutral
      markers can provide a baseline against which, test for the role of natural
      selection in functionally relevant genes of An. minimus would be possible.

TI  - Effects of extract of soapnut Sapindus emarginatus on esterases and phosphatases 
      of the vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Our earlier investigations with kernels from the soapnut Sapindus emarginatus
      revealed it as a new source of botanical biocide with potent antimosquito
      activity, as evident from the proven unique ability of the aqueous kernel extract
      to kill all the developmental stages of three important vector mosquito species, 
      Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. This extract was
      also found to be safe for two non-target aquatic insects. As a sequel to these
      findings, we have further examined quantitative and qualitative changes in total 
      proteins, esterases, and phosphatases in whole body homogenates of fourth instar 
      larvae and pupae of A. aegypti exposed to this extract at an appropriate
      threshold time for its lethal effect to gain insights into the impact of the
      botanical biocide on biochemical characteristics of the target vector mosquito at
      two distinct developmental stages. The profiles of proteins, esterases
      (acetylcholinesterse, alpha- and beta-carboxylesterases), and phosphatases (acid 
      and alkaline) exhibited distinct patterns of variation during normal development 
      of fourth instar larvae and pupae, indicating intrinsic difference in biochemical
      features between these two developmental stages of A. aegypti. Upon exposure of
      the larvae to the extract, significant reduction in the activities of
      acetylcholinesterse, beta-carboxylesterase, and acid phosphatases were recorded, 
      whereas the total proteins, alpha-carboxylesterase and alkaline phosphatase
      activities were unaffected. By contrast, only alkaline phosphatase activity was
      significantly affected in pupae exposed to the extract. Analysis of these enzymes
      in native PAGE revealed that they exist in isoforms in both the larvae and pupae.
      The alterations in the levels of enzymatic activities observed from the
      quantitative assays of various enzymes were reflected by the respective zymograms
      with perceptible differences in the intensity and the number of bands detected
      especially with beta-carboxylesterase, acid and alkaline phosphatase activity
      between the control and exposed test organisms. Despite the fact that the soapnut
      kernel extract causes mortality of both the larvae and pupae of A. aegypti, the
      findings of this study demonstrate that the impact of this extract is most
      pronounced in various enzyme profiles of the larvae rather than the pupae. Such
      discrepancy implicates the presence of unique biochemical mechanisms in the pupae
      of mosquito for detoxification of botanical biocides.

      districts of Orissa, India.
PG  - 981-7

AB  - The study was undertaken in eight endemic districts of Orissa, India, to find the
      members of the species complexes of Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles
      fluviatilis and their distribution patterns. The study area included six forested
      districts (Keonjhar, Angul, Dhenkanal, Ganjam, Nayagarh and Khurda) and two
      non-forested coastal districts (Puri and Jagatsingpur) studied over a period of
      two years (June 2007-May 2009). An. culicifacies A, B, C and D and An.
      fluviatilis S and T sibling species were reported. The prevalence of An.
      culicifacies A ranged from 4.2-8.41%, B from 54.96-76.92%, C from 23.08-33.62%
      and D from 1.85-5.94% (D was reported for the first time in Orissa, except for
      occurrences in the Khurda and Nayagarh districts). The anthropophilic indices
      (AI) were 3.2-4.8%, 0.5-1.7%, 0.7-1.37% and 0.91-1.35% for A, B, C and D,
      respectively, whereas the sporozoite rates (SR) were 0.49-0.54%, 0%, 0.28-0.37%
      and 0.41-0.46% for A, B, C and D, respectively. An. fluviatilis showed a
      similarly varied distribution pattern in which S was predominant (84.3% overall);
      its AI and SR values ranged from 60.7-90.4% and 1.2-2.32%, respectively. The
      study observed that the co-existence of potential vector sibling species of An.
      culicifacies (A, C and D) and An. fluviatilis S (> 50%) was responsible for the
      high endemicity of malaria in forested districts such as Dhenkanal, Keonjhar,
      Angul, Ganjam, Nayagarh and Khurda (> 5% slide positivity rate). Thus, the
      epidemiological scenario for malaria is dependent on the distribution of the
      vector sibling species and their vectorial capacity.

PG  - 185-94
LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-2242-y [doi]
AB  - Insecticide resistance and inadequate attention to the application instructions
      of topical pediculicides are common reasons for treatment failure. Essential oils
      or plant extracts are good and safe alternatives due to their low toxicity to
      mammals and easy biodegradability. The present study was carried out to establish
      the pediculocidal and larvicidal activity of synthesized silver nanoparticles
      (AgNPs) using leaf aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia Miers (Menispermaceae)
      against the head louse Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Phthiraptera:
      Pediculidae) and fourth instar larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus
      Grassi and filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). We
      reported the aqueous plant extract and synthesized AgNPs against head lice and
      vectors. Direct contact method was conducted to determine the potential of
      pediculocidal activity. The synthesized AgNPs characterized by UV-vis spectrum,
      scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction. 
      Head lice and mosquito larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous
      extracts and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. The results suggest that the optimal
      times for measuring mortality effects of synthesized AgNPs were 33% at 5 min, 67%
      at 15 min, and 100% after 1 h. The maximum activity was observed in the
      synthesized AgNPs against lice, A. subpictus and C. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) =
      12.46, 6.43 and 6.96 mg/L; r (2) = 0.978, 0.773 and 0.828), respectively. The
      findings revealed that synthesized AgNPs possess excellent anti-lice and mosquito
      larvicidal activity. These results suggest that the green synthesis of AgNPs have
      the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of head
      lice and vectors.

PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.1016/S2221-1691(11)60066-X [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ovicidal and repellent activities of methanol leaf
      extract of Ervatamia coronaria (E. coronaria) and Caesalpinia pulcherrima (C.
      pulcherrima) against Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus), Aedes aegypti
      (Ae. aegypti) and Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi). METHODS: The ovicidal
      activity was determined against three mosquito species at various concentrations 
      ranging from 50-450 ppm under the laboratory conditions. The hatch rates were
      assessed 48 h after treatment. The repellent efficacy was determined against
      three mosquito species at three concentrations viz., 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/cm(2)
      under the laboratory conditions. RESULTS: The crude extract of E. coronaria
      exerted zero hatchability (100% mortality) at 250, 200 and 150 ppm for Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi, respectively. The crude extract 
      of C. pulcherrima exerted zero hatchability (100% mortality) at 375, 300 and 225 
      ppm for Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. Stephensi, respectively. The
      methanol extract of E. coronaria found to be more repellenct than C. pulcherrima 
      extract. A higher concentration of 5.0 mg/cm(2) provided 100% protection up to
      150, 180 and 210 min against Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi,
      respectively. The results clearly showed that repellent activity was dose
      dependent. CONCLUSIONS: From the results it can be concluded the crude extracts
      of E. coronaria and C. pulcherrima are an excellent potential for controlling Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi mosquitoes.

AB  - Green nanoparticle synthesis has been achieved using environmentally acceptable
      plant extract and eco-friendly reducing and capping agents. The present study was
      based on assessments of the antiparasitic activities to determine the efficacies 
      of synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Mimosa 
      pudica Gaertn (Mimosaceae) against the larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles
      subpictus Grassi, filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera:
      Culicidae), and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus Canestrini (Acari: Ixodidae).
      Parasite larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extract of M.
      pudica and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. AgNPs were rapidly synthesized using the
      leaf extract of M. pudica and the formation of nanoparticles was observed within 
      6 h. The results recorded from UV-vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray
      diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
      support the biosynthesis and characterization of AgNPs. The maximum efficacy was 
      observed in synthesized AgNPs against the larvae of A. subpictus, C.
      quinquefasciatus, and R. microplus (LC(50) = 13.90, 11.73, and 8.98 mg/L, r (2) =
      0.411, 0.286, and 0.479), respectively. This is the first report on antiparasitic
      activity of the plant extract and synthesized AgNPs.

AB  - Since ancient times, plant and microbial products were used in various aspects.
      However, their use against insects decreased when chemical products became
      developed. Recently, concerns increased with respect to public health and
      environmental security requiring detection of natural products that may be used
      against insects. In this study, mosquito Larvicidal and ovicidal activity of
      crude hexane, ethyl acetate, benzene, chloroform, and methanol extracts of the
      leaf of three plants, Eclipta alba, Cardiospermum halicacabum, and Andrographis
      paniculata, were tested against the early third-instar larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi (Liston) (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was observed after 
      24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the
      highest larval mortality was found in methanol extract of A. paniculata, E. alba,
      and C. halicacabum against the larvae of A. stephensi (LC(50) = 79.68, 112.56,
      and 133.01 ppm; LC(90) = 154.66, 220.68, and 270.72 ppm), respectively. Mean
      percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post-treatment.
      The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of
      extract and directly proportional to the eggs. Mortality of 100% with methanol
      and ethyl acetate extract of A. paniculata and methanol extract of E. alba were
      exerted at 200 ppm and methanol and benzene extract of C. halicacabum exerted at 
      150 ppm. This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the malaria
      vector, A. stephensi. Therefore, this study provides first report on the
      larvicidal and ovicidal activities against malaria vector, A. stephensi of E.
      alba plant extracts.

TI  - Expression profile of prophenoloxidase-encoding (acppo6) gene of Plasmodium
      vivax-refractory strain of Anopheles culicifacies.
PG  - 1220-6
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies is the main vector for transmission of Plasmodium vivax
      malaria in the Indian subcontinent. A strain of An. culicifacies isolated from
      its natural niche displayed complete refractoriness to P. vivax by melanotic
      encapsulation of ookinetes. Prophenoloxidases are key components of the
      phenoloxidase cascade that leads to recognition and melanization of invading
      organisms. We isolated and cloned prophenoloxidase-encoding acppo6 gene of An.
      culicifacies and analyzed its expression profile under various regimens of immune
      challenge. The acppo6 was differentially expressed during various stages of
      larval development. The acppo6 transcription was also up-regulated in response to
      bacteria and Plasmodium vinckei petteri challenge. The transcript levels of the
      acppo6 gene were higher in naive adult refractory female mosquitoes as compared
      with female susceptible mosquitoes. Furthermore, the induction of acppo6 in the
      susceptible strain upon Plasmodium infection was negligible as compared with that
      of the refractory strain. The observation is suggestive of the role of acppo6 in 
      effectuating a melanotic response in Plasmodium-incompetent naturally occurring
      refractory An. culicifacies strain.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-2193-3 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of crude extracts of
      marine actinobacteria on larvicidal, repellent, and ovicidal activities against
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex gelidus (Diptera: Culicidae). The early fourth 
      instar larvae of C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. gelidus, reared in the laboratory,
      were used for larvicidal, ovicidal, and repellent assay with crude extracts of
      actinobacteria. Saccharomonospora spp. (LK-1), Streptomyces roseiscleroticus
      (LK-2), and Streptomyces gedanensis (LK-3) were identified as potential biocide
      producers. Based on the antimicrobial activity, three strains were chosen for
      larvicidal activity. The marine actinobacterial extracts showed moderate to high 
      larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure at 1,000 ppm and the highest larval
      mortality was found in extract of LK-3 (LC(50) = 108.08 ppm and LC(90) = 609.15
      ppm) against the larvae of C. gelidus and (LC(50) = 146.24 ppm and LC(90) =
      762.69 ppm) against the larvae of C. tritaeniorhynchus. Complete protections for 
      240 min were found in crude extract of LK-2 and LK-3 at 1,000 ppm, against
      mosquito bites of C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. gelidus, respectively. After 24-h
      treatment, mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed. The
      percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract
      and directly proportional to the eggs. Crude extracts of LK-1 and LK-3 showed no 
      hatchability at 1,000 ppm against C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. gelidus,
      respectively. This is an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of Japanese
      encephalitis vectors, C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. gelidus.

AB  - Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol
      techniques in the future. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adulticidal
      activity and adult emergence inhibition (EI) of leaf hexane, chloroform, ethyl
      acetate, acetone, and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb,
      Andrographis lineata Wallich ex Nees., Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex
      Nees., Cocculus hirsutus L. Diels, Eclipta prostrata L., and Tagetes erecta L.
      tested against malarial vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae). 
      All plant extracts showed moderate adulticidal activity and EI effects after 24 h
      of exposure at 1,000 ppm; however, the highest adulticidal activity was observed 
      in ethyl acetate extract of A.lineata, chloroform extract of A. paniculata,
      acetone extract of C. hirsutus, and methanol extract of T. erecta (LD(50) =
      126.92, 95.82, 109.40, and 89.83 ppm; LD(90) = 542.95, 720.82, 459.03, and 607.85
      ppm); and effective EI was found in leaf acetone extract of the A. marmelos,
      ethyl acetate extract of A. lineata, methanol extracts of C. hirsutus, and T.
      erecta, (EI(50) = 128.14, 79.39, 143.97, and 92.82 ppm; EI(90) = 713.53, 293.70, 
      682.72, and 582.59 ppm), respectively, against A. subpictus. These results
      suggest that the leaf methanol extract of C. hirsutus and T. erecta have the
      potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of A.
      subpictus. Therefore, this study provides first report on the mosquito
      adulticidal activity and EI of plant extracts against malaria vector.

AB  - A Gram-negative, aerobic, golden yellow, rod-shaped bacterium, a strain
      designated ICGEB-L15(T), was isolated from the larval midgut of Anopheles
      stephensi captured in District Jhajjar, Haryana, India. The strain ICGEB-L15(T)
      grows at 30-50 degrees C (optimum 30-37 degrees C), pH 6.5-8.5 (optimum 7.0-8.0) 
      and in the presence of 2% NaCl. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) (22.5% of 
      total fatty acid), anteiso-C(15:0) (16.5%), iso-C(17:1) 9c (10.3%), iso-C(16:0)
      (7.3%), C(16:0) (6.1%), and iso-C(11:0) (5.3%). The strain showed the highest 16S
      rRNA gene sequence similarities with the type strains Pseudoxanthomonas
      daejeonensis KCTC 12207(T) (97.4%), Pseudoxanthomonas kaohsiungensis J36(T)
      (97.17%), and Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana AMX 26B(T) (97.11%). The DNA relatedness
      between ICGEB-L15(T) and Pseudoxanthomonas daejeonensis KCTC 12207(T),
      Pseudoxanthomonas kaohsiungensis J36(T) and Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana AMX 26B(T)
      was 24.5%, 28.2%, and 33.6%, respectively. The G+C content of genomic DNA was
      69.9 mol%. The major isoprenoid quinone of strain ICGEB-L15(T) was Q-8. The
      strain ICGEB-L15(T) represents a novel species of the genus Pseudoxanthomonas
      based on physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic properties; therefore, the
      name Pseudoxanthomonas icgebensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is
      ICGEB-L15(T) (=KACC 14090(T) =DSM 22536(T)).

      using aqueous leaf extract against fourth instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus
      Grassi and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). Nanoparticles are
      being used in many commercial applications. It was found that aqueous silver ions
      can be reduced by aqueous extract of plant parts to generate extremely stable
      silver nanoparticles in water. The results recorded from UV-vis spectrum,
      scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared
      support the biosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles. Larvae
      were exposed to varying concentrations of plant extracts and synthesized silver
      nanoparticles for 24 h. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however,
      the maximum efficacy was observed in crude methanol, aqueous, and synthesized
      silver nanoparticles against the larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) = 8.89, 11.82,
      and 0.69 ppm; LC(90) = 28.65, 36.06, and 2.15 ppm) and against the larvae of C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 9.51, 13.65, and 1.10 ppm; LC(90) = 28.13, 35.83, and 
      3.59 ppm), respectively. These results suggest that the leaf methanol, aqueous
      extracts of N. nucifera, and green synthesis of silver nanoparticles have the
      potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the A. 
      subpictus and C. quinquefasciatus. This is the first report on the mosquito
      larvicidal activity of the plant extracts and synthesized nanoparticles.

PG  - 211-9
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. Natural products of plant origin with insecticidal properties have been
      used in recent years for control of a variety of pest insects and vectors. The
      present study was based on assessments of the larvicidal activity to determine
      the efficacies of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol
      extracts of ten medicinal plants tested against fourth instar larvae of malaria
      vector, Anopheles stephensi Liston and lymphatic filariasis vector, Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). The larvicidal activity was assessed
      by the procedure of WHO with some modification. The highest larval mortality was 
      found in leaf acetone of Adhatoda vasica, bark ethyl acetate of Annona squamosa, 
      methanol leaf and flower of Cassia auriculata, leaf ethyl acetate of Hydrocotyle 
      javanica, methanol leaf and seed of Solanum torvum and leaf hexane extracts of
      Vitex negundo against the fourth instar larvae of An. stephensi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. The calculated LC90 for acetone, ethyl acetate, methanol and
      hexane extracts of dried leaf and bark of A. vasica, A. squamosa, S. torvum, and 
      V. negundo were in the range of 70.38-210.68 ppm. Our results suggest that the
      leaf methanol extract of S.torvum and bark ethyl acetate extract of A. squamosa
      from Southern India have the potential for use to control mosquitoes. Therefore, 
      this study provides the larvicidal activity against An. stephensi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus of plant extracts.

      subpictus Grassi (Diptera:Culicidae).
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable
      alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The present investigations were 
      made to evaluate the repellent, ovicidal and oviposition-deterrent potential of
      leaf hexane and chloroform extracts of Aegle marmelos, Andrographis lineata,
      Andrographis paniculata, Cocculus hirsutus, Eclipta prostrata and Tagetes erecta 
      against Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera:Culicidae). The hexane extract of A. 
      lineata was more effective in exhibiting the repellent action against the
      mosquito as compared with A. marmelos extract. Complete protections for 150 min
      were found in hexane extract of A. lineata at 500 ppm against An. subpictus
      bites. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 24 h after
      treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the
      concentration of extract and directly proportional to the eggs. No hatchability
      was observed with hexane and chloroform extracts of A. lineata, A. paniculata and
      hexane extract of T. erecta were exerted at 1,000 ppm. The percentage of
      effective oviposition repellency of 93.07, 93.95, 98.03, 90.43, 92.63, 81.53,
      94.81, 97.50, 97.26, 92.22, 82.85 and 72.77 at 500 ppm and the lowest repellency 
      of 62.03, 53.64, 73.47, 59.05, 57.95, 48.17, 62.22, 72.99, 75.48, 67.77, 40.57
      and 52.11 at 31.25 ppm in hexane and chloroform extracts of A. marmelos, A.
      lineata, A. paniculata, C. hirsutus, E. prostrata and T. erecta, respectively.
      The oviposition activity index (OAI) values revealed that the solvent plant
      extracts have deterrent effect, and they caused a remarkable negative response
      resulting in oviposition of very few eggs. These results clearly reveal that the 
      hexane extract of A. lineata, served as a potential repellent, ovicidal and
      oviposition- deterrent against An. subpictus.

AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the known malaria
      vectors in south and southeastern Iran. Earlier ITS2 sequences analysis of
      specimens from Iran demonstrated only a single genotype that was identical to
      species Y in India, which is also the same as species T. We identified 2
      haplotypes in the An. fluviatilis populations of Iran based on differences in
      nucleotide sequences of D3 domain of the 28S locus of ribosomal DNA (rDNA).
      Comparison of sequence data from 44 Iranian specimens with those publicly
      available in the Genbank database showed that all of the 28S-D3 sequences from
      Kazeroun and Khesht regions in Fars Province were identical to the database entry
      representing species U in India. In other regions, all the individuals showed
      heterozygosity at the single nucleotide position, which identifies species U and 
      T. It is argued that the 2 species may co-occur in some regions and hybridize;
      however, the heterozygosity in the 28S-D3 locus was not reflected in ITS2
      sequences and this locus for all individuals was identical to species T. This
      study shows that in a newly diverged species, like members of An. fluviatilis
      complex, a single molecular marker may not be sufficiently discriminatory to
      identify all the taxa over a vast geographical area. In addition, other molecular
      markers may provide more reliable information for species discrimination.

AB  - Spilanthes acmella (Family: Asteraceae) commonly known as "toothache plant" is
      known to possess strong insecticidal and larvicidal properties. Experiments have 
      been conducted to isolate and characterise the biolarvicidal compounds from the
      flower head extract of micropropagated S. acmella plants employing various tools 
      like FT-IR, TLC, CC, NMR. FT-IR spectroscopy of the crude hexane extract sample
      revealed the presence of amide (secondary metabolite) as functional group in S.
      acmella flower heads. The crude extract was separated into 85 fractions (100 ml
      each) through silica gel column chromatography using hexane-ethyl acetate mobile 
      phase. All fractions were tested for their larvicidal activity against late
      III/early IV instar Anopheles stephensi larvae and fraction showing maximum
      bioefficacy against aforesaid larvae was further resolved into three separate
      bands on Preparative TLC plate, the respective R (f) values being (a) 0.18, (b)
      0.23 and (c) 0.27. Based on Proton NMR spectrum of the eluted compounds and their
      comparison with published results, three different compounds were identified:
      N-isobutyl-2,6,8-decatrienamide (compound 1), undeca-2E,7Z,9E-trienoic acid
      isobutylamide (compound 2) from band a and
      (2E)-N-(2-methylbutyl)-2-undecene-8,10-diynamide (compound 3) from band b. The
      amount of the compounds obtained were 338 mg (compounds 1 and 2) and 188.4 mg
      (compound 3), respectively. This is the first report of biolarvicidal compounds
      isolation and characterisation from micropropagated S. acmella plants.

      Bangladesh, north-east India.
PG  - 263
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in Garo hills of Meghalaya, and death cases are
      reported annually. Plasmodium falciparum is the major parasite, and is solely
      responsible for each malaria-attributable death case. Garo hills are categorized 
      high-risk for drug-resistant malaria; however, there exists no data on malaria
      transmitting mosquitoes prevalent in the region. Included in this report are
      entomological observations with particular reference to vector biology
      characteristics for devising situation specific intervention strategies for
      disease transmission reduction. METHODS: The epidemiological data of the West
      Garo hills have been reviewed retrospectively for 2001-2009 to ascertain the
      disease transmission profile given the existing interventions. Point prevalence
      study was conducted in Dalu Community Health Centre that lies in close proximity 
      to international border with Bangladesh to ascertain the true prevalence of
      malaria, and parasite species. Mosquito collections were made in human dwellings 
      of malaria endemic villages aiming at vector incrimination, and to study relative
      abundance, resting and feeding preferences, and their present susceptibility
      status to DDT. RESULTS: Investigations revealed that the West Garo hill district 
      is co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, but P. falciparum
      was the predominant infection (> 82%). Malaria transmission was perennial and
      persistent with seasonal peak during May-July corresponding to months of high
      rainfall. Entomological collections revealed that Anopheles minimus was the
      predominant species that was incriminated by detection of sporozoites in salivary
      glands (infection rate 2.27%), and was ascertained to be fully susceptible to
      DDT. CONCLUSION: For the control of malaria, improved diagnosis and sustained
      supply of drugs for artemisinin-based combination therapy are strongly advocated,
      which should be enforced for treatment of every single case of P. falciparum.
      Greater political commitment is called for organized vector control operations
      along border/high-risk areas to contain the spread of drug-resistant malaria, and
      averting impending disease outbreaks.

      after their sequential withdrawal from indoor residual spraying in Surat
      district, India.
PG  - 260-4
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Under the national antimalaria programme DDT was
      introduced in early 1950s for vector control and later hexachloro cyclohexane
      (HCH) followed by malathion and recently synthetic pyrethroids in 1990s to manage
      the insecticide resistance in Anopheles culicifacies. Subsequent replacement led 
      to development of multiple resistances in An. culicifacies in Surat district in
      Gujarat State. Indoor residual spray (IRS) was completely withdrawn in southern
      villages in Surat in 2002. This study was undertaken in these areas to study the 
      persistence of resistance to DDT, malathion and deltamethrin after sequential
      withdrawal of IRS with these insecticides at different times. METHODS:
      Susceptibility tests on An. culicifacies were conducted using standard WHO
      methods and kits. Mortality, knockdown time and lethal times were calculated for 
      An. culicifacies exposed to WHO prescribed diagnostic concentrations of different
      insecticide impregnated papers. RESULTS: Persistence of DDT-resistance was
      observed even after 30 yr of its withdrawal from IRS. Similarly, persistence of
      malathion resistance was also observed after 9 yr of its withdrawal from IRS,
      while reversal of deltamethrin-resistance was observed very fast within 2-3 yr
      after its withdrawal from IRS in 2002. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Present data 
      indicate that the quantum of reversion of insecticide resistance in a population 
      is relative and depends on the genetic stability of the respective resistance
      genes in the mosquitoes. In the present study withdrawal of pyrethroid-IRS
      resulted in increased susceptibility against pyrethroids alone and was
      independent of existence of resistance to insecticides of other groups. This
      study emphasizes that appropriate rotation of different insecticides; including
      carbamates may prevent or delay the onset of resistance.

TI  - Laboratory selection of carbofuran tolerant line of Culex quinquefasciatus Say,
      the filarial vector at Mysore.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - Carbofuran is a systemic insecticide/nematicide extensively employed in modern
      agriculture and public health to combat various insect pests and vectors. The
      development of insecticide resistance due to natural selection pressure by
      Anopheline and Culicine mosquitoes has created serious repercussions in mosquito 
      control and disease eradication campaigns. In this regard Culex quinquefasciatus,
      a widely dispersed domestic mosquito and the only vector of lymphatic filariasis 
      in India, was selected for the present experiment. In order to assess the
      resistance development in this species, it was subjected to carbofuran bioassay
      by employing WHO method for 10 generations. The results of larval selection test 
      up to F10 revealed a significant increase in tolerance development in every
      generation compared to the susceptible F1. The results revealed up to 16.225
      times tolerance after 10 generations. The LC50 observed in F10 is 1.298 ppm
      compared to 0.08 ppm in the F1. The implications of the observations will be
      discussed.

AB  - Various plant parts of Lablab purpureu s L. were collected and analyzed
      separately for their rotenoid content. Among the plant parts, the maximum content
      was in the roots and minimum in the seeds. The identity of different rotenoids
      was confirmed by melting point, mixed melting point, UV, and infrared spectral
      studies and gas-liquid chromatography. Six rotenoids (deguelin, dehydrodeguelin, 
      rotenol, rotenone, tephrosin, and sumatrol) were isolated, identified, and
      quantified both in vivo and in vitro. Toxicological studies of extracts showed
      bioefficacy against causal agents of malaria, dracunculiasis, and amoebiasis.

TI  - Surfactin: a novel mosquitocidal biosurfactant produced by Bacillus subtilis ssp.
      subtilis (VCRC B471) and influence of abiotic factors on its pupicidal efficacy.
PG  - 406-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2010.02912.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The rpoB gene of the mosquito pupicidal isolate Bacillus subtilis (VCRC
      B471) was amplified to confirm the subspecies as subtilis. The mosquito pupicidal
      activity expressed by the biosurfactant surfactin is novel, and hence, the
      influence of abiotic factors like pH, temperature of water and sunlight on its
      efficacy was studied under laboratory conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The rpoB
      gene amplicon of the bacterium (c. 570 bp of) was sequenced (accession number:
      EU057603). The relatedness of the bacterium to other members of the genus
      Bacillus was studied by tree construction, and the identity of VCRC B471 was
      confirmed as B. subtilis ssp. subtilis. The mosquito pupicidal activity exhibited
      by surfactin was found to be unaffected between pH 3-9, temperatures 25 and 37
      degrees C and exposure to sunlight/UV radiation. Further, the pupicidal activity 
      of surfactin was not diminished after exposure to 121 degrees C for 15 min,
      indicating its thermostable nature. CONCLUSIONS: VCRC B471 is confirmed as a
      strain of B. subtilis ssp. subtilis. The mosquitocidal toxin, surfactin produced 
      by this bacterium being stable to UV and varied temperature, active at acidic and
      basic pH and temperatures between 25 and 42 degrees C renders this molecule an
      interesting lead to be developed as a mosquitocidal agent. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The mosquitocidal toxin, surfactin produced by B. subtilis
      ssp. subtilis (VCRC B471), being a biodegradable biosurfactant, exhibiting high
      stability to varied environmental conditions, can be used year round in breeding 
      habitats and will be a prospective microbial toxin for use against mosquitoes.

      malathion insecticide and Plasmodium vivax infection in Anopheles stephensi.

AB  - The effect of the range of temperature on the thermal adaptation in Anopheles
      stephensi Liston 1901 was evaluated in the laboratory. Late third instar larvae
      of An. stephensi were exposed to variable temperatures viz. 37 degrees C, 39
      degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and their lethal time to 
      cause 50% mortality (LTM(50)) values were calculated. All larvae survived up to
      39 degrees C of exposure. However, at 45 degrees C, they died within 30 min of
      exposure. Pre-exposure to variable temperatures and re-exposure to higher
      temperatures conferred adaptive thermotolerance. The larvae pre-adapted at 41
      degrees C that were re-exposed to 43 degrees C, and larvae pre-adapted at 39
      degrees C that were re-exposed to 45 degrees C, were found more thermotolerant
      than the thermally non-adapted larvae. Adaptive cross-tolerance to malathion was 
      also induced by pre-exposing them to 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C. It suggests
      that temperature stress also play an important role in the development of
      adaptive cross-tolerance to other stress conditions. Similarly, the oocyst rate
      was relatively more in adults that emerged from larvae pre-adapted at 40 degrees 
      C as compared to adults that emerged from thermally non-adapted larvae and with
      lower oocyst load.

      mosquito.
PG  - 1275-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-010-1996-6 [doi]
AB  - Essential oil of Plectranthus amboinicus was studied for its chemical composition
      and larvicidal potential against the malarial vector mosquito Anopheles
      stephensi. Totally 26 compounds were identified by GC and GC-MS. The major
      chemical compounds were carvacrol (28.65%) followed by thymol (21.66%),
      alpha-humulene (9.67%), undecanal (8.29%), gamma-terpinene (7.76%), rho-cymene
      (6.46%), caryophyllene oxide (5.85%), alpha-terpineol (3.28%) and beta-selinene
      (2.01%). The larvicidal assay was conducted to record the LC(50) and LC(90)
      values and the larval mortality was observed after 12 and 24 h of exposure
      period. The LC(50) values of the oil were 33.54 (after 12 h) and 28.37 ppm (after
      24 h). The LC(90) values of the oil were 70.27 (after 12 h) and 59.38 ppm (after 
      24 h). The results of the present study showed that the essential oil of P.
      amboinicus is one of the inexpensive and eco-friendly sources of natural mosquito
      larvicidal agent to control/reduce the population of malarial vector mosquito.

AB  - The Anopheles philippinensis and An. nivipes mosquitoes that form part of the An.
      annularis species group are morphologically very similar and difficult to
      differentiate as adults. In consequence, researchers generally refer to all
      field-collected individuals of these species simply as the An.
      philippinensis-nivipes species complex. Although this species complex is
      understood to play a role in the transmission of parasites causing human malaria 
      in north-eastern India, the identity of the exact species involved, and the
      relative importance of the local An. philippinensis and An. nivipes, are far from
      clear. To settle this issue, house-frequenting female adults of the An.
      philippinensis-nivipes species complex were collected from 23 localities in the
      six north-eastern states, identified to species (using an allele-specific PCR to 
      explore the insects' ribosomal-DNA internal-transcribed-spacer-2 sequences) and
      checked for Plasmodium DNA (using a nested PCR based on the 18S subunit of the
      parasite's ribosomal DNA). Of the 337 females of the An. philippinensis-nivipes
      species complex that were investigated, 275 were identified as An. nivipes and 62
      as An. philippinensis. Malarial infection was detected in the heads/thoraces of
      just two specimens, with P. falciparum DNA detected in one An. nivipes from
      Nagaland state and one An. nivipes from Assam state. These results provide
      unambiguous evidence of the presence of both An. philippinensis and An. nivipes
      in the north-eastern region of India and the involvement of An. nivipes in
      transmitting P. falciparum in this area.

      forest breeder malaria vector Anopheles baimaii, known earlier as An. dirus
      species D in the northeastern region of India. Breeding potential of the vector
      in forest areas was found to be high in water stored in jungle pool (69.84%)
      followed by elephant footprints with clear water (39.13%) and with turbid water
      (26.19%), whereas in forest fringe areas, the vector breeding was more prominent 
      in elephant footprints: 65.11% in clear water and 62.5% in turbid water. Although
      other habitats had shown only low breeding of the vector, all types of habitats
      were positively correlated with malaria occurrence. Cattle hoof marks (r = 0.998)
      and elephant footprint (turbid; r = 0.999) explained nearly the same amount of
      variance. It was observed that deforestation as well as elephant habitat-type
      destruction had engendered man-elephant conflicts intensively in fringe areas.
      Seasonal abundance pattern of this vector was found to vary in forest and forest 
      fringe areas in relation to different habitats. Seasonal abundance of An. baimaii
      was significantly different in different habitats. The Tukey post hoc comparisons
      indicated that the abundance of An. baimaii in different habitats was
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) in monsoon season than that of premonsoon and
      postmonsoon seasons. No significant difference was observed between premonsoon
      and postmonsoon seasons. The findings therefore will eventually help to predict
      transmission of malaria in targeted area and in formulating an improved malaria
      control program in the northeastern region of India.

TI  - Reduced susceptibility to selected synthetic pyrethroids in urban malaria vector 
      Anopheles stephensi: a case study in Mangalore city, South India.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic pyrethroids are potent insecticides most commonly used in
      the vector control programme. These are applied for indoor residual sprays, space
      sprays and in impregnated bed nets. Resistance reduces the efficacy of
      insecticides. Thus, the susceptibility status of the target vector(s) is
      monitored routinely to select the effective ones. A study was undertaken in a
      malaria endemic coastal city Mangalore, Karnataka, South India, against the known
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. METHODS: The susceptibility status was
      assessed at diagnostic doses of DDT (4%), malathion (5%), deltamethrin (0.05%),
      cyfluthrin (0.15%), alphacypermethrin (0.10%), lambdacyhalothrin (0.05%) and
      permethrin (0.75%) using the standard WHO tube test method during
      October/November 2006. RESULTS: Anopheles stephensi was resistant to malathion by
      54.9%, but tolerant to deltamethrin by 86.1%, cyfluthrin 95.5% and
      alphacypermethrin 90.6%, whereas it was susceptible to DDT by 98.1%,
      lambdacyhalothrin 98.6% and permethrin 100.0%, respectively. The KDT50 and KDT95 
      values for these insecticides also showed the similar responses. CONCLUSION:
      Susceptibility of An. stephensi to DDT is an important finding as this has never 
      been used in Mangalore city, whereas its rural counterpart Anopheles culicifacies
      is widely resistant to this insecticide. The study explores the selection and
      rotation of the appropriate insecticide molecule even within the same group for
      effective vector management.

TI  - Molecular identification and phylogeny of Myzomyia and Neocellia series of
      Anopheles subgenus Cellia (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 931-9
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2010.05.016 [doi]
AB  - Any biological study is only meaningful if the concerned organism is accurately
      identified; this is particularly important in vector-borne disease studies where 
      correct and precise identification of the target species has medical and
      practical implications, such as in vector control. The Myzomyia series is divided
      into four groups including the Funestus group, which consists of five subgroups, 
      i.e. Aconitus, Culicifacies, Funestus, Minimus, Rivulorum, and the Neocellia
      series, which is divided into three groups Annularis, Jamesii and Maculatus.
      Members of the Funestus group of Myzomyia and the Annularis group of the
      Neocellia series are difficult to identify because of the morphological overlap
      that exists within the groups. Therefore a multiplex polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) assay was developed based on the sequence of the D3 region of 28S rDNA to
      distinguish between four members (An. fluviatilis, An. culicifacies, An. varuna
      and An. aconitus) of three subgroups (Minimus, Aconitus, Culicifacies) of the
      Funestus group of Myzomyia and three members (An. annularis, An. pallidus and An.
      philippinensis) of the Annularis group of the Neocellia series of the Anopheles
      subgenus Cellia, prevalent in Orissa, India. Polymorphism present on the D3
      region of rDNA allowed the development of a species-specific primer that when
      combined with two universal primers lead to a simple and sensitive multiplex
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) assay. This assay can be
      applied as an unbiased confirmatory method for the identification of
      morphological variants, imperfectly preserved specimens and life stages for which
      taxonomic keys do not allow a definitive species determination. Finally,
      phylogenetic relationships between the members of the two series were determined 
      using D3 sequence data. The phylogenetic relationships inferred from maximum
      parsimony and the neighbour joining analysis separated two distinct monophyletic 
      clades, one consisting of species of Myzomyia and other of species of the
      Neocellia series. The molecular phylogeny obtained in this work matches with that
      of the classical morphological taxonomy reasonably well, with proper species
      arrangements.

TI  - Presence of two alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014F and L1014S, and a novel
      mutation, V1010L, in the voltage gated Na+ channel of Anopheles culicifacies from
      Orissa, India.
PG  - 146
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knockdown resistance in insects resulting from mutation(s) in the
      voltage gated Na+ channel (VGSC) is one of the mechanisms of resistance against
      DDT and pyrethroids. Recently a point mutation leading to Leu-to-Phe substitution
      in the VGSC at residue 1014, a most common kdr mutation in insects, was reported 
      in Anopheles culicifacies-a major malaria vector in the Indian subcontinent. This
      study reports the presence of two additional amino acid substitutions in the VGSC
      of an An. culicifacies population from Malkangiri district of Orissa, India.
      METHODS: Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato (s.l.) samples, collected from a
      population of Malkangiri district of Orissa (India), were sequenced for part of
      the second transmembrane segment of VGSC and analyzed for the presence of
      non-synonymous mutations. A new primer introduced restriction analysis-PCR
      (PIRA-PCR) was developed for the detection of the new mutation L1014S. The An.
      culicifacies population was genotyped for the presence of L1014F substitution by 
      an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and for L1014S substitutions
      by using a new PIRA-PCR developed in this study. The results were validated
      through DNA sequencing. RESULTS: DNA sequencing of An. culicifacies individuals
      collected from district Malkangiri revealed the presence of three amino acid
      substitutions in the IIS6 transmembrane segments of VGSC, each one resulting from
      a single point mutation. Two alternative point mutations, 3042A>T transversion or
      3041T>C transition, were found at residue L1014 leading to Leu (TTA)-to-Phe (TTT)
      or -Ser (TCA) changes, respectively. A third and novel substitution, Val
      (GTG)-to-Leu (TTG or CTG), was identified at residue V1010 resulting from either 
      of the two transversions-3028G>T or 3028G>C. The L1014S substitution co-existed
      with V1010L in all the samples analyzed irrespective of the type of point
      mutation associated with the latter. The PIRA-PCR strategy developed for the
      identification of the new mutation L1014S was found specific as evident from DNA 
      sequencing results of respective samples. Since L1014S was found tightly linked
      to V1010L, no separate assay was developed for the latter mutation. Screening of 
      population using PIRA-PCR assays for 1014S and ARMS for 1014F alleles revealed
      the presence of all the three amino acid substitutions in low frequency.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the presence of L1014S (homologous to
      the kdr-e in An. gambiae) and a novel mutation V1010L (resulting from G-to-T or
      -C transversions) in the VGSC of An. culicifacies in addition to the previously
      described mutation L1014F. The V1010L substitution was tightly linked to L1014S
      substitution. A new PIRA-PCR strategy was developed for the detection of L1014S
      mutation and the linked V1010L mutation.

AB  - The entomopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum are the next generation mosquito
      controlling agent. F. oxysporum basically contains unique toxin and can be a
      selectively good agent in tropical countries. We are reporting here the efficacy 
      of the metabolites of F. oxysporum against the larvae of Anopheles stephensi and 
      Culex quinquefasciatus in the laboratory. F. oxysporum was grown on Czapek Dox
      broth. The bioassays were run at five different concentrations (1.30, 1.60, 1.77,
      1.90, and 2.00 ppm). The LC(50), LC(90), and LC(99) values with 95% fiducial
      limits and probit equations were calculated by probit analysis. The mortality was
      observed after 24, 48, and 72 h against all instars. The LC(90) values in the
      case of C. quinquefasciatus after 48 h when calculated were 1.85, 1.92, 1.87, and
      1.87 ppm, respectively, while LC(99) values calculated were 2.24, 2.25, 2.18, and
      2.19 ppm. Moreover, after 48 h in the case of A. stephensi, the LC(50) values for
      the first, second, third, and fourth instars were recorded as 1.48, 1.51, 1.71,
      and 1.50 ppm, respectively. The LC(90) values recorded were 1.88, 1.91, 1.93, and
      1.89 ppm and LC(99) values observed were 2.36, 2.23, 2.26, and 2.21 ppm. The
      results obtained 24, 48, and 72 h have been compared and it was observed
      significantly that 48 h after exposure the metabolite has more pathogenicity. The
      results of the metabolites of F. oxysporum may be considered as a new bio-control
      agent for vector mosquitoes if the field trial succeeds.

PG  - 329-37
AB  - Understanding on the chemical ecology of mosquito behavior is of paramount
      importance in developing control programs employing attractants and repellents.
      Several workers focused on topical repellents and oviposition attractants of
      mosquitoes, however, only limited work has been accomplished on mosquito
      oviposition repellents. The present systematic investigation provides evidence on
      the effectiveness of a C21 fatty acid ester- hexadecyl pentanoate, to stimulate
      antennal olfactory receptors of Aedes aegypti (L.), Ae. albopictus (Skuse), and
      Anopheles stephensi (Liston) that mediate their long-range olfaction guided
      flight orientation behavior by repelling the gravid females of these mosquito
      vectors in the olfactometer. The compound loaded onto an effervescent tablet
      retained its repellent property in the treated substrates for up to 1 wk at 10
      mg/L. In places, where the mosquito breeding habitats are near to human
      habitations, could be treated with hexadecyl pentanoate to repel the ovipositing 
      gravid females as a component of the integrated approach for mosquito management 
      by disrupting the mosquito life cycle and population growth.

TI  - Effectiveness of a new granular formulation of biolarvicide Bacillus
      thuringiensis Var. israelensis against larvae of malaria vectors in India.
PG  - 69-75

AB  - Control of vector(s) or mosquitoes, in general, through biolarvicide as an
      alternate biocontrol agent is a greatest desire. We evaluated a water-dispersible
      granular formulation biolarvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti,
      H-14 serotype; VectoBac((R)) WDG) in the laboratory and also in the field against
      two principal malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi.
      Laboratory evaluations against laboratory-reared immature of the two species were
      carried out at a temperature of 28 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and 70%-80% relative
      humidity. Field trials were conducted in a rural area and in Bangalore city,
      Karnataka, South India. First trial against the rural vector An. culicifacies was
      carried out in stone quarry pits at dosages of 0.05, 0.2, and 1 g/m(2). The
      second trial against urban vector An. stephensi was carried out in ring wells at 
      0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g/m(2) dosages. Laboratory tests revealed increased
      efficacy against An. stephensi. The fifty percent lethal concentration (LC(50))
      and LC(90) values against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were 0.348 and 1.008
      mg/L (chi(2) = 8.49; p > 0.05) and 0.245 and 0.533 mg/L (chi(2) = 4.67; p <
      0.05), respectively. Based on the findings of no pupal production in the field,
      the formulation was effective up to 14 days at 0.2 g/m(2) or more appropriately
      at 0.25 g/m(2) dose for both the species under field conditions. We discuss how
      this new formulation was evaluated against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi
      under laboratory and field conditions. No adverse effects were observed on the
      nontarget species such as frogs, their tadpoles, small local fish, Notonectid
      bugs, and water scatters. We conclude that VectoBac WDG is effective at 0.25
      g/m(2) and be recommended for its use in the vector-borne disease control program
      under integrated vector management concept.

TI  - Wash-resistance and field evaluation of alphacypermethrin treated long-lasting
      insecticidal net (Interceptor) against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies and
      Anopheles fluviatilis in a tribal area of Orissa, India.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.05.002 [doi]
AB  - A field trial was conducted on the efficacy of Interceptor nets-a long-lasting
      insecticidal net (LLN) factory treated with alphacypermethrin 0.667% (w/w)
      corresponding to 200mg/m(2), against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies and
      Anopheles fluviatilis in one of the highly endemic areas of Orissa. The study
      area comprised 19 villages which were randomized into three clusters and
      designated as Interceptor net cluster, untreated net cluster, and no net cluster.
      Baseline studies showed that both the vector species An. culicifacies and An.
      fluviatilis were 100% susceptible to alphacypermethrin. Results of
      wash-resistance and bio-efficacy of Interceptor nets showed 100% mortality in An.
      culicifacies and An. fluviatilis even after 20 washings. Bioassays on the
      Interceptor nets while in use in the field conditions showed a knockdown effect
      on 70-90% mosquitoes during different months of intervention after 3 min of
      exposure and 100% mortality was recorded after 24h of recovery period. The median
      knockdown time for these species ranged between 4.10-5.25 min and 4.00-5.00 min
      respectively during intervention period. In Interceptor net study area, there was
      a significant reduction of 88.9, 96.3 and 90.6% in the entry rate of An.
      culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and other anopheline species respectively with an
      over all reduction of 87.5% in total mosquitoes. The overall feeding success rate
      of mosquitoes in the trial villages was only 12.8% in comparison to 35.0 and
      78.8% in villages with untreated nets and no nets respectively. A significant
      reduction was also recorded in parity rate and human blood index of vector
      species in Interceptor net area. The results of the study showed that Interceptor
      nets are effective against the malaria vectors and may be used as a suitable
      intervention strategy in high-risk areas.

TI  - Phylogenetic inference of Indian malaria vectors from multilocus DNA sequences.
PG  - 755-63
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2010.04.008 [doi]
AB  - Inferences on the taxonomic positions, phylogenetic interrelationships and
      divergence time among closely related species of medical importance is essential 
      to understand evolutionary patterns among species, and based on which, disease
      control measures could be devised. To this respect, malaria is one of the
      important mosquito borne diseases of tropical and sub-tropical parts of the
      globe. Taxonomic status of malaria vectors has been so far documented based on
      morphological, cytological and few molecular genetic features. However,
      utilization of multilocus DNA sequences in phylogenetic inferences are still in
      dearth. India contains one of the richest resources of mosquito species diversity
      but little molecular taxonomic information is available in Indian malaria
      vectors. We herewith utilized the whole genome sequence information of An.
      gambiae to amplify and sequence three orthologous nuclear genetic regions in six 
      Indian malaria vector species (An. culicifacies, An. minimus, An. sundaicus, An. 
      fluviatilis, An. annularis and An. stephensi). Further, we utilized the
      previously published DNA sequence information on the COII and ITS2 genes in all
      the six species, making the total number of loci to five. Multilocus molecular
      phylogenetic study of Indian anophelines and An. gambiae was conducted at each
      individual genetic region using Neighbour Joining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML), 
      Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian approaches. Although tree topologies with
      COII, and ITS2 genes were similar, for no other three genetic regions similar
      tree topologies were observed. In general, the reconstructed phylogenetic status 
      of Indian malaria vectors follows the pattern based on morphological and
      cytological classifications that was reconfirmed with COII and ITS2 genetic
      regions. Further, divergence times based on COII gene sequences were estimated
      among the seven Anopheles species which corroborate the earlier hypothesis on the
      radiation of different species of the Anopheles genus during the late Cretaceous 
      period.

AB  - Chrysosporium tropicum is a keratinophilic fungus and an effective mosquito
      control agent. This fungus was grown in Richards broth at 27 +/- 2 degrees C and 
      a relative humidity of 75% +/- 5% for 15 +/- 2 days. Filtration was done with
      Whatman number 1 filter paper, column chromatography, and flash chromatography.
      Adulticidal efficacy was performed against a mixed population of mosquitoes
      including Culex quinquefasciatus, Anophelese stephensii, Aedes aegypti at five
      different concentrations 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1 by adding fungal filtrate of
      flash chromatography to methanol in different ratio (metabolite/methanol). The
      experiment was conducted in the cage with an area of 2 x 2 x 3 ft. The mortality 
      in mosquito population was recorded after 8 hours of exposure, and adulticidal
      activity was tested by probit analysis. The LC(50) was determined to be 4.9921
      ml. Results of present study confirm that metabolites of C. tropicum can be
      utilized as alternative biological control agents for adult mosquitoes.

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies AC-43 and AC-29 disrupt Plasmodium vivax development in the
      Indian malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 87-94
AB  - A repertoire of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was generated against the midgut
      proteins of Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes. The mAbs AC-43 and AC-29
      significantly inhibited Plasmodium vivax development inside the mosquito midgut. 
      The number of oocysts that developed was reduced by 78.6% when mosquitoes
      ingested a combination of these two mAbs along with the blood meal. AC-43 mAb
      binds to the epitope common in 97, 80 and 43 kDa polypeptides from the midgut
      protein extract, as indicated by western blot analysis. Similarly, the mAb AC-29 
      recognized 52, 44, 40 and 29 kDa polypeptides. These female midgut-specific
      polypeptides are shared between An. culicifacies and An. stephensi, two major
      vectors of malaria in India. Deglycosylation assays revealed that O-linked
      carbohydrates are the major components in epitopes corresponding to AC-43 and
      AC-29. Gold particle labelling revealed that both these mAbs preferentially bind 
      to glycoproteins at the apical microvilli and the microvillus-associated network 
      present inside transverse sections of the gut epithelium. These regions are
      particularly known to have receptors for ookinetes, which enable them to cross
      this epithelial barrier and provide them with certain necessary chemicals or
      components for further development into oocysts. Therefore, these glycoproteins
      appear to be potential candidates for a vector-directed transmission-blocking
      vaccine (TBV).

TI  - Evolutionary insights into insecticide resistance gene families of Anopheles
      gambiae.
PG  - 620-8
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2010.04.002 [doi]
AB  - Insecticide resistance (IR) is one of the major obstacles in insect pests and
      insect borne disease control strategies, the mechanism of which is known to be
      genetically controlled. Three major gene families (CYP, GST and COE) have been
      identified encoding various proteins to metabolize endogenous as well as
      exogenous compounds that are responsible for IR mechanisms in insects.
      Understanding evolutionary patterns of genes of such important functions could
      lead to important understanding, based on which, further studies to control
      various insect borne infectious diseases could be initiated. We herein utilized
      the whole genome sequence information of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae and
      inferred evolutionary pattern of the three known IR gene families (CYP, GST and
      COE). The pattern of conservation of IR genes across 38 other taxa was determined
      to infer evolutionary pattern of these gene families. Chromosomal distribution of
      IR genes was ascertained and each individual gene of IR gene families was also
      mapped on the chromosomal arms of An. gambiae. Differential distributional and
      quantitative aspects of introns in each gene were determined and genetic
      architecture of genes from all three gene families was compared to draw
      differential evolution of IR gene families. Further, phylogenetic relationships
      among genes of each of the three gene families were also inferred. These results 
      in correlation with chromosomal location of each gene have provided valuable
      information about evolutionary history of IR gene families.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of Ficus benghalensis L. plant leaf extracts against Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say, Aedes aegypti L. and Anopheles stephensi L. (Diptera:
      Culicidae).
PG  - 107-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the larvicidal efficacy of different extracts of Ficus 
      benghalensis L. against Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Aedes aegypti L. and
      Anopheles stephensi L. (Diptera: Culicidae). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Larvicidal
      efficacy of the crude leaf extracts of Ficus benghalensis with three different
      solvents like methanol, benzene and acetone was tested against the early second, 
      third, fourth instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and
      Anopheles stephensi. RESULTS: The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of
      treatment. Among the three solvents the maximum efficacy was observed in
      methanol. The letal concentration (LC50) values of Ficus benghalensis against
      early second, third and fourth larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes Aegypti
      and Anopheles stephensi were 41.43, 58.21 and 74.32 ppm, 56.54, 70.29 and 80.85
      ppm and 60.44, 76.41 and 89.55 ppm respectively. No mortality was observed in
      controls. The chi-square value were significant at p < 0.05 level. CONCLUSION:
      The methanol extract of F. benghalensis showed good larvicidal activity against
      three vector mosquitoes.

AB  - Anopheles subpictus is a complex of four isomorphic sibling species A, B, C and D
      and is recognized as a primary vector of malaria, a disease of great
      socio-economic importance, in Australasian Zone, Celebes, Portuguese Timor and
      South East Asia and a secondary vector in Sri Lanka. This species is also a
      vector of some helminth and arboviruses. This species has been reported so far
      from nineteen countries of the Oriental and Australasian Zones. An. subpictus
      complex is the most abundant anopheline in most parts of the Indian subcontinent,
      with a widespread distribution eastwards and southwards to Papua New Guinea,
      westwards to Iran and northwards to China. Resistance to insecticide is alarming 
      in many parts of the world. Different aspects of this important mosquito species 
      including attempts related to its control have been discussed which will be
      highly useful to carry out further research.

TI  - Evaluation of larvicidal efficacy of Solanum xanthocarpum storage against vector 
      mosquitoes in north - western Rajasthan.
PG  - 883-8
AB  - Efficacy of the methanol extracts from fruits without seeds, whole yellow ripe
      fruits and seeds of the plant Solanum xanthocarpum was evaluated against larvae
      of Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex
      quinquefasciatus, the important vector mosquitoes prevalent in the arid region.
      Experiments were carried out on late 3rd or early 4th instar larvae of these
      mosquitoes using standard WHO technique. 24 and 48 hr LC50 and LC90 values along 
      with their fiducial limits, regression equation, chi-square (chi2)/heterogeneity 
      of the response have been determined by log probit regression analysis. The 24 hr
      LC50 values as observed for fruit without seeds, whole fruits and seeds after six
      months were 79.6, 91.7 and 131.7; 131.4, 186.9 and 195.6; 273.4, 290.9 and 377.6 
      and 384.9, 450.6 and 520.0 mg l(-1) for An. culicifacies, An. stephensi, Ae.
      aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus respectively. However, the 24 hr LC50 values for
      fresh yellow ripe fruits and seeds determined previously were 51.6 and 66.9; 52.2
      and 73.7; 118.3 and 123.8 and 157.1 and 154.9 mg l(-1) for the above four vector 
      species respectively showing that the efficacy was decreased two to three times
      more after six months of storage. The 24 hr LC50 values were also determined
      after one year of storage for fruit without seeds, whole fruits and seeds. The
      values were 103.3, 120.1 and 195.7; 146.3, 224.3 and 251.2; 316.9, 336.5 and
      426.2 and 393.0, 500.3 and 656.7 mg l(-1) as compared to the 24 hr LC50 values of
      47.4, 51.6 and 66.9; 52.3, 52.2 and 73.7; 108.0, 118.3 and 123.8 and 141.1, 157.1
      and 154.9 mg l(-1) of all the three fresh preparations for the above four vector 
      species respectively showing that the efficacy was further decreased after one
      year of storage. Further the extracts should be used when they have been prepared
      from the fresh plant parts instead of the old stored parts. Larvae of anophelines
      were found more susceptible as compared to culicine. HPLC and IR studies showed
      that active component might be present in the fruits and seeds of this plant
      species. The study would be of great importance while planning vector control
      strategy based on alternative plant derived insecticides.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a mosquito pupicidal metabolite of a
      Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain.
PG  - 1737-44
LID - 10.1007/s00253-010-2449-y [doi]
AB  - The culture supernatant of a strain of Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis isolated
      from mangrove forests of Andaman and Nicobar islands, India was found to kill
      larval and pupal stages of mosquitoes. A chloroform extract of the culture
      supernatant of the bacterium showed pupicidal effects at an LC(50) dose of 1
      microg/ml. The mosquitocidal metabolite(s) produced by this strain were purified 
      by gel permeation chromatography. The purified fraction was subjected to Fourier 
      transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum of
      active fraction/CHCl3 residue showed strong band characteristic of peptides.
      MALDI-TOF spectrum of the sample showed well-resolved group of peaks at m/z
      values 1,030.6, 1,046.7, 1,044.6, 1,060.5, 1,058.6, 1,058.7, and 1,074.6. The
      results indicated production of different isoforms of surfactin, ranging from
      C13-C15. Further, the sfp gene responsible for the production of surfactin was
      amplified and sequenced. In conclusion, this study showed that the mosquito
      pupicidal metabolite(s), produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis is the cyclic
      lipopeptide, surfactin. The mode of action of surfactin on pupae of mosquitoes is
      discussed. This is the first report on the mosquito pupicidal activity of
      surfactin produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis.

PG  - 221-6
AB  - Larvicidal efficacy of the aqueous and methanol extracts from green unripe and
      yellow ripe fruits, seeds, leaves and roots of the plant Solanum xanthocarpum was
      evaluated against Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and 
      Culex quinquefasciatus, the important mosquito vectors prevalent in the arid
      region. Studies were carried out on late 3rd orearly 4th instarlarvae of these
      species using standard WHO technique. Based on concentration mortality data LC50 
      and LC90 values along with their fiducial limits, regression equation, chi-square
      (chi2)/heterogeneity of the response have been determined bylog probit regression
      analysis. The 24 hr LC50 values as observed for aqueous extracts for green unripe
      and yellow ripe fruits were 112.7, 498.2 and 846.3 mg l(-1) and 104.7, 267.7and
      832.2 mg l(-1) for Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      respectively. However, the 24 hr LC50 values formethanol extracts of yellow ripe 
      fruits and seeds were 51.6, 52.2, 118.3 and 157.1 mg l(-1) and 66.9, 73.7, 123.8 
      and 154.9 mg l(-1) for the above four vector species respectively. The results
      showed that larvae of anophelines were much more susceptible as compared to
      culicines to both the aqueous and methanol extracts from fruits and seeds of the 
      plant tested. The methanol extracts were found 2-5 times more effective as
      compared to the aqueous extracts. The chi-square values calculated during the
      analysis did not show any heterogeneity of the response. Experiments conducted
      with aqueous and methanol extracts from leaves and roots of this plant species
      didn't show any larvicidal activity against any of the mosquito species tested.
      The study would be of great importance while formulating vector control strategy 
      based on alternative plant based insecticides.

      stephensi larvae.
PG  - 395-8
AB  - The emergence of resistance by both Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles stephensi
      made the search for an alternative environmentally safe plant based insecticide
      inevitable. Artemisia annua is a well known antimalarial. Present study is an
      attempt to induce callus production from young leaves of Artemisia annua plant
      and study its larvicidal activity against larvae of Anopheles stephensi. Callus
      was initiated by using different concentrations of auxins and cytokinins. A
      suitable culture media was standardized for optimal growth of callus. Healthy
      callus cultures were obtained in the slightly modified Murashige and Skoog's
      medium +NAA and BAP (0.03 and 0.2 mg l(-1) respectively) + Sucrose 20 gm l(-1)
      +Agar 8 gm l(-1) within 28 days of inoculation. Callus was successively extracted
      in order of increasing polarity of solvents. Larvicidal activity, in terms of
      lethal concentration (LC50) of the callus extract in chloroform was calculated to
      be 18.45 +/- 0.75 ppm after72 hr against third instar larvae of A. stephensi.

      characterization of Anopheles dirus (Diptera: Culicidae) complex species in
      north-east India.
PG  - 49-54
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.01.003 [doi]
AB  - The identity and distribution of the prevalent member species of the Anopheles
      dirus complex mosquitoes in the north-eastern region of India was investigated in
      a cross-sectional study. We altogether collected 267 individuals of An. dirus
      s.l. from 27 forested/forest fringed locations spread across the seven
      north-eastern states, identified the species using a ribosomal DNA (r-DNA) second
      internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) based allele specific polymerase chain
      reaction (ASPCR) method and sequenced the ITS2 locus in a sub set of mosquitoes. 
      An. baimaii was identified as the main, almost exclusive (266/267), species of
      the Dirus complex throughout the north-east India with no intraspecific variation
      in the 479 base pair long ITS2 sequences in 59 of the 60 individuals sequenced.
      Ribosomal DNA of one individual from Assam state did not amplify in the ASPCR,
      possessed 786 base pair long ITS2 sequence and showed 99.7% similarity with the
      sequence of An. dirus species D (An. baimaii) from Yunnan province of China,
      later referred to as species X of the Dirus complex. These observations suggest

AB  - Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) is the urban vector of malaria in
      the Indian subcontinent and several countries of the Middle East. The genetics of
      propoxur resistance (pr) in An. stephensi larvae was studied to determine its
      mode of inheritance. A diagnostic dose of 0.01 mg/L as recommended by WHO was
      used to establish homozygous resistant and susceptible strains. Reciprocal
      crosses between the resistant and susceptible strains showed an F(1) generation
      of incomplete dominance. The progenies of backcrosses to susceptible parents were
      in 1 : 1 ratio of the same phenotypes as the parents and hybrids involved. The
      dosage mortality (d-m) lines were constructed for each one of the crosses, and
      the degree of dominance was calculated. It is concluded that propoxur resistance 
      in An. stephensi larvae is due to monofactorial inheritance with incomplete
      dominance and is autosomal in nature.

      weaknesses in disease control, important risk factors.
PG  - 288
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-288 [doi]
AB  - An outbreak of malaria in Naxalbari, West Bengal, India, in 2005 was investigated
      to understand determinants and propose control measures. Malaria cases were
      slide-confirmed. Methods included calculation of annual blood examination rates
      (ABER, number of slides examined/population), collection of water specimens from 
      potential vector-breeding sites, sorting of villages in categories depending on
      the number of abandoned wells within two kilometers radius and review of the DDT 
      spray coverage. Cases were compared with matched neighbourhood controls in terms 
      of personal protection using matched odds ratios (MOR). 7,303 cases and 17 deaths
      were reported between April 2005 and March 2006 with a peak during October rains 
      (Attack rate: 50 per 1,000, case fatality: 0.2%). The attack rate increased
      according to the number of abandoned wells within 2 kilometres radius (P <
      0.0001, Chi-square for trend). Abandoned wells were Anopheles breeding sites.
      Compared with controls, cases were more likely to sleep outdoors (MOR: 3.8) and
      less likely to use of mosquito nets and repellents (MOR: 0.3 and 0.1,
      respectively). DDT spray coverage and ABER were 39% and 3.5%, below the
      recommended 85% and 10%, respectively. Overall, this outbreak resulted from
      weaknesses in malaria control measures and a combination of factors, including
      vector breeding, low implementation of personal protection and weak case
      detection.

      mosquitoes.
PG  - S2
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-S2-S2 [doi]
AB  - Research on sterile mosquito technology from 1955 to the 1980s provided a
      substantial body of knowledge on propagation and release of sterile mosquitoes.
      Radiation sterilisation and chemosterilisation have been used effectively to
      induce dominant lethality and thereby sterilise important mosquito vectors in the
      laboratory. Experimental releases of chemosterilised males provided complete
      control of Anopheles albimanus in a small breeding population (14-15 sq km) in El
      Salvador. Releases of radiation sterilised males failed to control either Aedes
      aegypti or Anopheles quadrimaculatus in the USA. Releases of radiation-sterilised
      and chemosterilised male Culex quinquefasciatus in the USA and India were
      successful in some instances. Development of genetic sexing systems for Anopheles
      and improved physical separation methods for Culex have made it possible to rear 
      and release males almost exclusively (> 99%) minimizing the release of potential 
      vectors, the females. Factors that affected efficacy in some field programmes
      included reduction of competitiveness by radiation, immigration of fertilized
      females from outside the release zones, and inability of laboratory-bred males to
      perform in the wild. Despite significant progress, institutional commitments to
      carry the process further were generally lacking in the late 1970s and until
      recently. Now, with renewed interest and support for further assessment of this
      technology, this paper summarizes the current knowledge base, prioritizes some
      areas of investigation, and challenges scientists and administrators to maintain 
      an awareness of progress, remain realistic about the interpretation of new
      findings, and make decisions about the sterile insect technique on the basis of
      informed scientific documentation. Areas recommended for priority research status
      include the establishment of genetic sexing mechanisms that can be transferred to
      other mosquito species, re-examination of radiation sterilisation, aerial release
      technology and mass rearing.

TI  - Antibodies raised against hemolymph of Anopheles culicifacies reduce the
      fecundity and malaria parasite development.
PG  - 255-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Several studies have been made to study the effect of
      antisera raised against different tissues (hemolymh, ovary, midgut and salivary
      glands) on the fecundity and malaria parasite development in the different
      species of mosquitoes but there are no reports on the antisera raised against the
      hemolymph of Anopheles culicifacies, the principal malaria vector in India
      accounting for 65% of malaria cases. Hence, an attempt was made to study the same
      and evaluate its impact on malaria parasite development. METHODS: Polyclonal and 
      multifactorial antibodies were produced in rabbits against heterogenous mixture
      of hemolymph proteins. Antibodies against hemolymph proteins were screened for
      their potential to influence reproductive performance of mosquitoes. Antibody
      titer in rabbit serum was determined by ELISA and putative candidate antigens
      were identified in the hemolymph of An. culicifacies by western blotting. Cross
      reactivity amongst various tissues vis-a-vis hemolymph protein was also
      identified. In addition, a significant reduction in oocyst development was also
      observed in An. culicifacies mosquitoes that ingested antihemolymph antibodies
      along with Plasmodium vivax. RESULTS: The maximum reduction in fecundity (57%)
      was observed during fourth week, after the last booster and number of oocyts per 
      infected mosquito reduced by 73.35% in the group of mosquitoes that ingested
      antihemolymph antibodies along with the infected blood meal respectively.
      However, the ingestion of antibodies against hemolymph proteins did not have
      significant influence on hatchability. Antisera raised against hemolymph proteins
      of An. culicifacies recognized 11 polypeptides by western blotting.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: During the present study, 11 putative candidate
      antigens were identified in the hemolymph of An. culicifacies, against which
      antibodies produced significantly reduced the fecundity by 57%. In addition, a
      significant reduction in oocyst development was also observed in An. culicifacies
      that ingested antihemolymph antibodies along with P.vivax.

AB  - Anopheline mosquitoes are vectors of human malaria and hence they are of greatest
      concern. Around 40% of the world's population resides in malaria affected areas. 
      Malaria affects poor communities and causes enormous economic losses. The deadly 
      disease annually causes clinical illness in 400-600 million people and kills 2-3 
      millions annually (WHO 2008). Faunistic survey was conducted in Fingeswar block
      in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh state of India during January 2003 to March
      2004 to asses the prevalence of different species of mosquitoes and their
      seasonal variations.Indoor resting mosquitoes were collected from selected houses
      in 5 villages using aspirator tube and torch light in the morning between
      06:00-08:00. Adult mosquitoes were identified using standard morphological and
      pictorial keys following Rao (1984), Das et al. (1991) and Reuben et al. (1994)
      and assessed as person hour density.A total of 13,248 mosquitoes were collected
      during the study period. Nine species of mosquitoes comprising of 4 genera with 5
      Anopheles, two Culex and one each Armigeres and Aedes were recorded. The malaria 
      vectors constituted 14.09% of the total mosquito collections. Anopheles subpictus
      (25.81%) showed the dominance followed by A. annularis (8.68%), A. barbirostris
      (6.76%), A. culicifacies (5.41%) and A. pallidus (4.11%). The other genus
      recorded included Culex quinquefasciatus (38.38%), C. vishnui (3.32%), Armigeres 
      subalbatus (6.92%) and Aedes albopictus (0.29%). The density of all the species
      were high in months of August, September and October, decreased in month of May
      and June 2003. There was a significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation between
      temperature and density of A. culicifacies and A. annularis. The seasonal
      distribution pattern of A. culicifacies (primary) and A. annularis (secondary)
      malaria vectors along with other mosquito species was studied which is an
      important component of epidemiological study of malaria. This information will
      help in formulating a baseline structure for control program in the study region.

TI  - Malaria transmission and disease burden in Assam: challenges and opportunities.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.1007/s12639-009-0002-7 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is major public health illness in Assam and 30-40% of the population is
      estimated to be at high-risk. Despite decades of attempted control interventions,
      malaria transmission is perennial and persistent in most parts of the state
      mostly transmitted by Anopheles minimus. Malaria outbreaks are returning
      associated with high rise in Plasmodium falciparum and attributable death cases. 
      Therapeutic efficacy investigations for treatment of malaria revealed that
      chloroquine resistance was widespread for which artemisinin-based combination
      therapy (ACT) is being instituted in the control program. For data based on the
      preceding years, we briefly reviewed the available information on transmission
      dynamics, vector biology and control, drug policy, and discuss the challenges and
      opportunities for strengthening interventions for malaria control to help design 
      situation specific strategies to check impending disease outbreaks with special
      reference to Assam. Under increased assistance from external agencies, we
      strongly advocate scaling up interventions based on mass distribution of
      long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for prevention and ACTs for treatment of
      drug-resistant malaria, and developing strong health delivery system in high-risk
      areas for meeting the complex emergencies and achieving transmission reduction.

TI  - Field evaluation of ZeroFly--an insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting against
      malaria vectors & its impact on malaria transmission in tribal area of northern
      Orissa.
PG  - 458-66
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting is a new
      technology to control mosquitoes in emergency shelter places and also temporary
      habitations in different locations. Therefore, field studies were conducted to
      assess the efficacy of ZeroFly plastic sheeting treated with deltamethrin on
      prevailing disease vectors Anopheles culicifacies and An. fluviatilis and its
      impact on malaria transmission in one of the highly endemic areas of Orissa.
      METHODS: The study was conducted in Birkera block of Sundargarh district, Orissa 
      state. The study area comprised 3 villages, which were randomized as ZeroFly
      plastic sheet, untreated plastic sheet and no sheet area. ZeroFly plastic sheets 
      and untreated plastic sheets were fixed in study and control villages
      respectively covering all the rooms in each household. Longitudinal studies were 
      conducted on the bioefficacy with the help of cone bioassays, monitoring of the
      mosquito density through hand catch, floor sheet and exit trap collections and
      fortnightly domiciliary active surveillance in all the study villages. RESULTS:
      In ZeroFly plastic sheeting area, there was a significant reduction of 84.7 per
      cent in the entry rate of total mosquitoes in comparison to pre-intervention
      phase. There was 56.2 per cent immediate mortality in total mosquitoes in houses 
      with ZeroFly sheeting. The overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the
      trial village was only 12.5 per cent in comparison to 49.7 and 51.1 per cent in
      villages with untreated plastic sheet and no sheet respectively. There was a
      significant reduction of 65.0 and 70.5 per cent in malaria incidence in ZeroFly
      plastic sheeting area as compared to untreated plastic sheet and no sheet area
      respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that introduction of
      ZeroFly plastic sheets in a community-based intervention programme is
      operationally feasible to contain malaria especially in the high transmission
      difficult areas.

AB  - Anophelesminimus s.l. and Anophelesfluviatilis s.l., two closely related taxa,
      are reported vectors of malaria in Assam state of India. We determined the DNA
      sequences of morphologically identified A. minimus s.l. and A. fluviatilis s.l.
      collected from the Kamrup district in Assam, for two rDNA loci-internal
      transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D3 domain of 28S rDNA (28S-D3). Analysis of rDNA 
      data revealed that the sequences of both the morphologically identified A.
      minimus s.l. and A. fluviatilis s.l. from Assam are identical, homologous to the 
      sequences of A. minimus s.s. (former species A) and different from that of all
      the reported members of the Fluviatilis Complex (species S, T and U). This
      indicates that A. fluviatilis s.l. being reported in Kamrup district, Assam, in
      low density, mostly during January to April, is actually a hypermelanic and
      seasonal variant of A. minimus. It was also found that the banding pattern on
      chromosome arm 2 (which bears species-diagnostic inversions for the Fluviatilis
      Complex) of A. minimus and of A. fluviatilis s.l. from Assam is homosequential
      with A. fluviatilis species U suggesting that probably previously described A.
      fluviatilis U from Assam were also A. minimus.

TI  - Wash-resistance and field efficacy of Olyset net, a permethrin-incorporated
      long-lasting insecticidal netting, against Anopheles minimus-transmitted malaria 
      in Assam, Northeastern India.
PG  - 403-10
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2008.0191 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The long-lasting insecticidal nets are ready-to-use, pretreated
      nets, which do not require retreatment for 4-5 years. Olyset nets that are made
      of high-density polyethylene monofilament yarn with 2% w/w permethrin
      incorporated (corresponding to 1 g/m(2)) are type-2 in which insecticide is
      incorporated into the polymers and are wash resistant. In these, insecticide
      migrates to the surface of the netting fiber to be bioavailable against
      mosquitoes and other insect pests. STUDY SITE AND OBJECTIVES: The present study
      was a village scale, field-based trial that was conducted in Plasmodium
      falciparum predominant area of Assam to assess feasibility, acceptability, and
      sustainability of this intervention against vector populations and disease
      transmission. We here report the research findings of Olyset net as an
      intervention against Anopheles minimus-transmitted malaria in foothill area of
      Assam for the first year of observations beginning July 2005 till June 2006.
      RESULTS: An. minimus, the mosquito vector species, was observed to be fully
      susceptible to permethrin. Follow-up investigations revealed that An. minimus
      mosquitoes had virtually disappeared in Olyset net villages, which was
      corroborated by data on human bait mosquito-landing catches. There was a
      consistent decline in the malarial incidence in Olyset net intervention villages,
      and the overall impact on the malarial transmission was significant compared to
      untreated net and no-net control villages for the corresponding study period. The
      bioavailability of insecticide on Olyset netting fiber was consistent (100% kill 
      effect) up to 10 months of monitoring, and was observed to be wash resistant even
      after the 20th wash at fortnightly intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The Olyset nets were
      safe to use, wash resistant, and assessed to be operationally feasible,
      community-based intervention for sustainable management of disease vectors
      against malaria. Community compliance and acceptance was high, and users reported
      decreased nuisance due to biting mosquitoes.

TI  - Evaluation of PermaNet 2.0 mosquito bednets against mosquitoes, including
      Anopheles minimus s.l., in India.
PG  - 449-57
AB  - Wash resistance and field bioefficacy of PermaNet 2.0 nets, long lasting
      insecticidal nets, against mosquitoes were evaluated in Assam, northeastern
      India. After repeated hand washings at 12-day intervals a decline in the mosquito
      killing ability of PermaNet nets was noted (trend chi2 38.9, p < 0.0001), yet
      these nets retained good insecticidal efficacy for up to 15 wash cycles,
      producing a 72.5% mean mortality of An. minimus 24 hours after a 3-minute
      exposure in World Health Organization cones after 15 washings. Significantly
      fewer (p < 0.001) mosquitoes were captured in self-baited landing collections in 
      houses equipped with PermaNet nets than in houses using untreated nets in the
      case of culicines (p < 0.001) but not with anophelines, including An. minimus.
      The use of PermaNet nets resulted in noticeably fewer bites from Culex
      pseudovishnui (68.5%) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (70%). Blood-feeding inhibition of
      mosquitoes in deliberately torn PermaNet nets was seen, indicating a protective
      effect for those sleeping under these nets. No serious adverse effects of the
      PermaNet nets were reported by users.

TI  - Vectorial role of Anopheles subpictus Grassi and Anopheles culicifacies Giles in 
      Angul District, Orissa, India.
PG  - 713-9
AB  - Malaria transmission by Anopheles subpictus Grassi, 1899 and Anopheles
      culicifacies Giles, 1901 was studied from March 2004 to February 2007 in Angul
      District, Orissa, India, which is highly endemic for malaria. Adult mosquitoes
      were collected from human dwellings using sucking tubes and a mechanical
      aspirator. After identification, some An. subpictus and An. culicifacies
      specimens were subjected to a precipitin test to determine their anthropophilic
      index and the remaining samples were preserved in isopropyl alcohol for
      sporozoite detection by nested PCR. An. subpictus was the most prevalent (29.0%) 
      anopheline species detected, followed by An. culicifacies (11.6%). The
      anthropophilic index for the An. subpictus was higher than An. culicifacies and
      was highest during the summer season. Malaria sporozoite rates of 0.52% and 1.82%
      were detected for An. subpictus and An. culicifacies, respectively. Sporozoites
      were detected during the summer in An. subpictus and during the rainy season and 
      winter in An. culicifacies. The slide positivity rate (SPR) was high during the
      summer. The high anthropophilic index and presence of sporozoites in An.
      subpictus during the summer indicate An. subpictus is a contributory factor for
      the high SPR during the summer, and An. culicifacies is a contributory factor for
      the high SPR during the rainy and winter seasons, along with other anophelines.
      In the present study An. subpictus has been incriminated as a vector of malaria
      for the first time in Orissa.

TI  - Amaranthus oleracea and Euphorbia hirta: natural potential larvicidal agents
      against the urban Indian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera:
      Culicidae).
PG  - 171-6
LID - 10.1007/s00436-009-1644-1 [doi]
AB  - Malaria control in developing countries is based largely on vector eradication by
      the use of mosquito larvicides which is an ideal method for controlling mosquito 
      and the related epidemics. On account of ecohazardous nature, nontarget
      specificity of chemical insecticides and evidences of developing resistance
      against them in the exposed species, currently, importance of secondary plant
      metabolites has been acknowledged. Insecticides of plant origin are
      environmentally safe, degradable, and target specific. In view of this fact, the 
      present work highlights the larvicidal property of extracts of Amaranthus
      oleracea and Euphorbia hirta against the third instar larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi, the urban malaria vector. LC(50) values for the carbon tetrachloride
      fraction of A. oleracea against larvae are 17,768.00 and 13,780.00 ppm after 24
      and 48 h of exposure accordingly. For the methanol extract of the same, LC(50)
      values are 15,541.00 and 10,174.00 ppm after 24 and 48 h of exposure. In the case
      of petroleum ether extract, LC(50) values after 24 and 48 h of exposure are
      848.75 and 311.50 ppm. LC(50) values for carbon tetrachloride extracts of E.
      hirta against the larvae are 11,063.00 and 10,922.00 ppm after 24 and 48 h of
      exposure, respectively. For methanol extract of the same extract, the LC(50)
      values are 19,280.00 and 18,476.00 ppm after 24 and 48 h of exposure. In the case
      of petroleum ether extract, LC(50) values after a 24- and 48-h exposure period
      are 9,693.90 and 7,752.80 ppm. The results obtained for petroleum extracts of A. 
      oleracea are encouraging and there are probabilities that the active principle
      contained in this extract may be more effective than its crude form and may serve
      as ecofriendly mosquito larvicide.

AB  - The adulticidal and larvicidal effect of indigenous plant extracts were
      investigated against the adult cattle tick Haemaphysalis bispinosa Neumann, 1897 
      (Acarina: Ixodidae), sheep fluke Paramphistomum cervi Zeder, 1790 (Digenea:
      Paramphistomatidae), fourth instar larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus 
      Grassi and Japanese encephalitis vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: 
      Culicidae). The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effect of leaf
      hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extracts of Annona
      squamosa L., Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, Gloriosa superba L., Mukia
      maderaspatensis (L.) M.Roem, Pergularia daemia (Forsk.) Chiov. and Phyllanthus
      emblica L. were exposed to different concentrations. All plant extracts showed
      moderate toxic effect on parasites after 24h of exposure; however, the highest
      mortality was found in leaf hexane extract of A. squamosa, methanol extracts of
      G. superba and P. emblica against H. bispinosa (LC(50)=145.39, 225.57 and
      256.08ppm); methanol extracts of C. asiatica, G. superba, P. daemia and P.
      emblica against P. cervi (LC(50)=77.61, 60.16, 59.61, and 60.60ppm); acetone,

TI  - Larvicidal & emergence inhibitory activities of NeemAzal T/S 1.2 per cent EC
      against vectors of malaria, filariasis & dengue.
PG  - 138-45
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Vector control, using agents of chemical origin,
      continues to be practiced in the control of vector borne diseases. However, due
      to some drawbacks including lack of selectivity, environmental contamination, and
      emergence and spread of vector resistance, development of natural products for
      vector control has been a priority in this area. In the present study we
      evaluated the larvicidal and emergence inhibitory activities of a neem based
      formulation Neem Azal T/S 1.2 per cent EC against the vectors of malaria,
      filariasis and dengue. METHODS: Larvicidal and emergence inhibition (EI) activity
      of a neem formulation, NeemAzal T/S 1.2 per cent EC, was studied in the
      laboratory respectively against early 4(th) and early 3(rd) instar larvae of
      Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti following standard 
      procedures. RESULTS: Among the three vector species studied, An. stephensi was
      highly susceptible to NeemAzal T/S as revealed by the LC(50) and LC(90) values
      (1.92 and 2.76 ppm). The formulation produced an overall mortality or inhibition 
      of emergence of 90 per cent (EI(90), when 3(rd) instar larvae were treated) at
      0.046, 0.208 and 0.866 ppm in An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae.
      aegypti, respectively. The corresponding EI(50) values were 0.006, 0.048 and
      0.249 ppm. On treatment, NeemAzal T/S induced certain morphogenetic
      abnormalities, broadly characterized in five types, in larvae, pupae and adults
      of all the three vector species. The percentage of dead specimens of any stage
      showing morphogenetic abnormalities was the maximum in Cx. quinquefasciatus
      (14.4%; n=2113) followed by Ae. aegypti. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our results
      indicated that because of its emergence inhibition activity, NeemAzal T/S 1.2 per
      cent EC could be a promising candidate for the use in integrated vector
      management programme and replace chemical insecticides.

TI  - Bionomics of Anopheles minimus and An. fluviatilis (Diptera: Culicidae) in
      east-central India, endemic for falciparum malaria: human landing rates, host
      feeding, and parity.
PG  - 1045-51
AB  - The host feeding of Anopheles minimus Theobald and An. fluviatilis James was
      studied in the villages of east-central India by conducting human landing
      collections between 1800 and 0600 hours at monthly intervals from May 2006 to
      July 2007. Four species of anopheline mosquitoes, An. minimus, An. fluviatilis,
      An. maculatus Theobald, and An. subpictus Grassi, were collected, the former two 
      known vector species of malaria being the most abundant (97.1%). The An. minimus 
      complex has been identified as sibling species A and An. fluviatilis complex as
      species S (90.9%) and T (9.1%). Both the species were prevalent throughout the
      year and obtained from landing collections indoors and outdoors. The average
      human landing density (HLD) of An. minimus and An. fluviatilis was 1.76 and 1.78 
      indoors and 1.71 and 1.56 per human per night outdoors, respectively. The HLD was
      relatively higher during the rainy season, although not significant in the case
      of An. fluviatilis. The human landing activity of An. minimus and An. fluviatilis
      occurred between 2000 and 0400 hours and peaked during 2300-0200 hours both
      indoors and outdoors.

TI  - Wash resistance and residual efficacy of long-lasting polyester netting coated
      with alpha-cypermethrin (Interceptor) against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in 
      Assam, northeast India.
PG  - 273-8
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2009.08.010 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is endemic in Assam, northeast India, with low-to-moderate transmission
      of the causative parasites, mostly by Anopheles minimus. Plasmodium falciparum is
      the predominant parasite (>60%), with remaining cases being due to P. vivax. As
      an alternative intervention for malaria control, long-lasting insecticidal nets
      [Interceptor coated with alpha-cypermethrin 10% suspension concentrate (SC),
      0.667% w/w, 0.2g/m(2)] underwent field evaluation for laboratory wash resistance 
      and residual efficacy in field conditions against malaria-transmitting
      mosquitoes. Based on entomological observations, the Interceptor net intervention
      was the most effective, corresponding to the lowest mosquito vector density in
      experimental villages. There was virtual disappearance of A. minimus in
      Interceptor net villages in contrast to the untreated net intervention and the
      no-net control. Contact cone bioassay tests revealed 100% mortality in the
      A.minimus group of mosquito species in the community using the Interceptor net,
      which was consistent during the follow-up monitoring period (October 2006 to
      April 2007) in field conditions. Similar levels of mortality were observed in
      laboratory-washed nets compared with unwashed nets, and wash resistance was
      consistent even after the 20th serial wash at fortnightly intervals. Community
      compliance and acceptance of the Interceptor net was high, with decreased
      nuisance due to biting mosquitoes and other household insect pests being
      reported.

AB  - In view of the recently increased interest in developing plant-based insecticides
      as an alternative to chemical insecticides, this study was undertaken to assess
      the larvicidal potential of the various fruit wall extracts of Momordica
      charantia (cucurbitaceae) against two species of mosquito vectors, Anophels
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Among the extracts tested, petroleum ether 
      (LC(50) = 27.60; 17.22 ppm and 41.36; 15.62 ppm) extract was found more effective
      than carbon tetrachloride (LC(50) = 49.58; 16.15 ppm and 80.61; 27.64 ppm) and
      methanol (LC(50) = 142.82; 95.98 ppm and 1,057.49; 579.93 ppm) extracts towards
      anopheline and culicine larvae after 24 and 48 h of exposure respectively. Thus, 
      all fruit wall extracts of M. charantia are toxic to both the larval species. M. 
      charantia may, therefore, act as an effective biolarvicide against mosquitoes in 
      the future.

PG  - 452-7
LID - 10.1016/j.pt.2009.06.004 [doi]
AB  - Malaria is a major vector-borne disease in India. Based on vast geographic areas 
      with associated topographic and climatic diversity, the variable malaria
      epidemiology in India is associated with high parasite genetic diversity and
      rapidly evolving drug resistance, differential distribution of vector species and
      emerging insecticide resistance and underlying human genetic diversity and past
      evolutionary histories. Further, changing climatic patterns have possibly changed
      malaria epidemiology to a great extent. The outcome of these changes is an
      increased incidence of Plasmodium falciparum over the P. vivax malaria in recent 
      years. Accordingly, the drug and insecticide application policy in India has
      changed too. The above facts and associated rapid shifting trend of malaria
      epidemiology makes India a hot-spot for malaria research.

AB  - Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol
      techniques in the future. The leaf acetone, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts 
      of Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb, Andrographis lineata Wallich ex Nees,
      and Cocculus hirsutus (L.) Diels were tested for oviposition-deterrent, ovicidal,
      and repellent activities against Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae).
      The percentage of effective oviposition repellency of 92.60 , 93.04, 95.20,
      88.26, 92.80, 94.01, 95.77, 96.93, and 92.54 at 500 ppm and the lowest repellency
      of 47.14, 58.00, 56.52, 64.93, 71.09, 66.42, 50.62, 57.62, and 65.73 at 31.25 ppm
      in acetone, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos, Andrographis 
      lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus, respectively. The oviposition activity index
      (OAI) value of acetone, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos,
      Andrographis lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus at 500 ppm were -0.86, -0.87, -0.90, 
      -0.78, -0.87, -0.86, -0.91, -0.94, and -0.86 respectively. The OAI values
      revealed that the solvent plant extracts have deterrent effect, and they caused a
      remarkable negative response resulting in oviposition of very few eggs. Mean
      percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 24 h after treatment. 
      The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of
      extract and directly proportional to the eggs. Mortality of 100% with ethyl
      acetate extract of Aegle marmelos, methanol extracts Aegle marmelos, Andrographis
      lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus were exerted at 1,000 ppm. The maximum repellent
      activity was observed at 500 ppm in methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos,
      Andrographis lineata, and ethyl acetate extract of Cocculus hirsutus, and the
      mean complete protection time ranged from 90 to 120 min with the different
      extracts tested. These results suggest that the leaf extracts of Aegle marmelos, 
      Andrographis lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus have the potential to be used as an
      ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of the Anopheles subpictus. Therefore,
      this study provides first report on the oviposition, ovicidal, and repellent
      activities against malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus of plant extracts from
      Southern India.

TI  - Laboratory studies on mosquito larvicidal efficacy of aqueous & hexane extracts
      of dried fruit of Solanum nigrum Linn.
PG  - 74-7
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Aqueous and organic solvent extracts of plants/plant
      parts were effective in killing the mosquito larvae. Comparative efficacy of the 
      aqueous and hexane extracts of dried fruit of Solanum nigrum was tested against
      five laboratory colonized strains of mosquito species, namely Anopheles
      culicifacies species A, An. culicifacies species C, An. stephensi, Culex
      quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti to assess the possibility for use of these
      extracts for their control. METHODS: Concentrations of aqueous extract of dried
      fruit in the range of 62.5 to 2000 ppm and hexane extract of dried fruit in the
      range of 0.781 to 150 ppm were used in bioassays. The mortality data were
      subjected to log probit regression analysis to determine the median lethal
      concentrations (LC(50) and LC(90)) to kill 50 and 90 per cent of the treated
      larvae of the respective species. RESULTS: All the five species registered 100
      per cent mortality in larval bioassays at 1000 ppm with aqueous extract and at
      100 ppm with hexane extract of dried fruit. In bioassays with aqueous extract An.
      culicifacies species A registered the lowest LC(50) of 208.5 ppm (range-208.5-359
      ppm for different mosquito species) while with hexane extract, An. stephensi
      registered the lowest LC(50) of 6.25 ppm (6.25- 17.63 ppm for different mosquito 
      species). The LC(50) of aqueous extract was 13-39 fold higher than the values of 
      hexane extract of dried fruit for different species. The calculated LC(90) for
      hexane extract of dried fruit for different species was in the range of
      43.38-95.28 ppm. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Hexane extract showed good mosquito
      larvicidal efficacy than that of the aqueous extract. The calculated LC(90) for
      the extract for different species was below 100 ppm and could be effective for
      comprehensive control of disease vectors.

      Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes.
PG  - 386
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-10-386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a tropical disease caused by protozoan parasite,
      Plasmodium, which is transmitted to humans by various species of female
      anopheline mosquitoes. Anopheles stephensi is one such major malaria vector in
      urban parts of the Indian subcontinent. Unlike Anopheles gambiae, an African
      malaria vector, transcriptome of A. stephensi midgut tissue is less explored. We 
      have therefore carried out generation, annotation, and analysis of expressed
      sequence tags from sugar-fed and Plasmodium yoelii infected blood-fed (post 24 h)
      adult female A. stephensi midgut tissue. RESULTS: We obtained 7061 and 8306 ESTs 
      from the sugar-fed and P. yoelii infected mosquito midgut tissue libraries,
      respectively. ESTs from the combined dataset formed 1319 contigs and 2627
      singlets, totaling to 3946 unique transcripts. Putative functions were assigned
      to 1615 (40.9%) transcripts using BLASTX against UniProtKB database. Amongst
      unannotated transcripts, we identified 1513 putative novel transcripts and 818
      potential untranslated regions (UTRs). Statistical comparison of annotated and
      unannotated ESTs from the two libraries identified 119 differentially regulated
      genes. Out of 3946 unique transcripts, only 1387 transcripts were mapped on the
      A. gambiae genome. These also included 189 novel transcripts, which were mapped
      to the unannotated regions of the genome. The EST data is available as ESTDB at
      http://mycompdb.bioinfo-portal.cdac.in/cgi-bin/est/index.cgi. CONCLUSION: 3946
      unique transcripts were successfully identified from the adult female A.
      stephensi midgut tissue. These data can be used for microarray development for
      better understanding of vector-parasite relationship and to study differences or 
      similarities with other malaria vectors. Mapping of putative novel transcripts
      from A. stephensi on the A. gambiae genome proved fruitful in identification and 
      annotation of several genes. Failure of some novel transcripts to map on the A.
      gambiae genome indicates existence of substantial genomic dissimilarities between
      these two potent malaria vectors.

AB  - Anopheles culicifacies, the most important malaria vector of peninsular India
      exist as a complex of five sibling species. The member species of the complex
      have various biological differences including their susceptibility to malaria
      parasites. The present attempt is made to study and compare the fecundity of the 
      differentially susceptible members of the An. culicifacies complex. Gravid female
      mosquitoes of species A, B and C were allowed to lay their eggs individually
      during first and second gonotrophic cycle. The eggs were counted after hatching
      and categorized as 'hatched eggs', 'unhatched eggs', 'embryonated eggs',
      'unembryonated eggs' and 'non/partially melanized eggs'. The data was analyzed
      using Student's t test, ANOVA, Chi-square and Pearson's correlation analysis. All
      females that were visually categorized as 'gravid' did not lay eggs. Species C
      laid maximum number of eggs per female. The eggs laid per female mosquito of each
      species were found to be significantly higher during second gonotrophic cycle as 
      compared with the first gonotrophic cycle. The eggs hatched per female in species
      C were found to be significantly higher than that of species A and B. The
      poor-vector species B mosquitoes were found to be the least fecund among the
      members of the species complex. The unembryonated eggs constitute the biggest
      proportion of the unhatched eggs in species A, B and C of the species complex.

TI  - Impact of etofenprox (Vectron 20 WP) indoor residual spray on malaria
      transmission.
PG  - 593-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: A longitudinal study was carried out to assess the impact
      of indoor residual spray with Vectron 20 WP (etofenprox) against Anopheles
      culicifacies and on malaria transmission in a selected village of Dadri primary
      health centre (PHC), District Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS:
      Two villages, namely Patadi and Anandpur in District Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar
      Pradesh, with similar malaria incidence and vector prevalence were selected for
      the present evaluation. In one village two rounds of indoor spraying of
      etofenprox (0.1 g/m(2)) were done at an interval of 12 wk and the other village
      was kept as control where no intervention except intensive active surveillance
      for early detection and prompt treatment (EDPT) was undertaken during the study
      period. Entomological and epidemiological data were collected using standard
      procedures. RESULTS: Persistence of the effectiveness of etofenprox against An.
      culicifacies was observed up to 12 wk. Spraying of etofenprox significantly
      reduced the density (P<0.001) and proportion of parous An. culicifacies
      mosquitoes (P<0.05) in the experimental village. There was a significant
      reduction in malaria cases in the experimental village during the post-spray
      period when compared to the control village (P<0.05). No adverse effect was
      reported by the spraymen and inhabitants during and after the spray.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Indoor residual spray of etofenprox (0.1 g/m(2))
      with an interval of three months in between two rounds of spray produced the
      desired impact in reducing the indoor resting density of vector mosquitoes and
      also in curtailing malaria transmission in the sprayed village when compared with
      the control village without spray.

TI  - Management of malaria threat following tsunami in Andaman & Nicobar Islands,
      India and impact of altered environment created by tsunami on malaria situation
      of the islands.
PG  - 204-11
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.07.028 [doi]
AB  - Andaman & Nicobar Islands (Indian Territory) are situated in the Bay of Bengal
      and endemic for malaria with perennial transmission. Anopheles sundaicus which
      prefers to breed in brackish water, is known as the main vector for malaria and
      maintains high endemicity of malaria. Tsunami waves entered the inhabited coastal
      areas, caused heavy devastation and left large areas inundated causing
      exceptionally high breeding sources for vector mosquitoes of malaria. The
      disaster created a new habitat suitable for the proliferation of malaria and
      other disease-carrying mosquitoes besides making thousands of people homeless.
      They were living in temporary open shelters, getting more exposed to mosquito
      bites. The population already had existing high parasite load. Hence, there was a
      real threat of malaria outbreak in the area. However, malaria was effectively
      controlled due to strategic planning and timely remedial measures. Malaria
      situation was monitored closely and epidemiological data of three subsequent
      years from 2005 to 2007 after tsunami were analysed and compared with pre-tsunami
      malaria data from 1986 to 2004. In this paper, effect of tsunami on malaria
      profile in these islands has been discussed along with action taken for its
      control.

      impact on various developmental stages of three vector mosquito species and
      nontarget aquatic insects.
PG  - 1425-34
LID - 10.1007/s00436-009-1574-y [doi]
AB  - Aqueous (physiological saline) extracts of seed kernel from seven indigenous
      plants were initially screened for their antimosquito activity against eggs,
      larvae of all instars, and pupae of Aedes aegypti. Among various seed kernels
      tested, the soapnut Sapindus emarginatus (Sapindaceae) extract was found to
      exhibit, for the first time, a strong antimosquito activity as evident from its
      ability to inflict 100% mortality of all the developmental stages of A. aegypti. 
      Furthermore, the kernel extract of S. emarginatus also exerted ovicidal,
      larvicidal, and pupicidal activity against two other important vector mosquitoes,
      namely, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Differential
      susceptibility of the various developmental stages of the three mosquito species 
      exposed to soapnut extract was also noticed. The kernel extract was found to be
      safe for two nontarget aquatic insects tested: the larvae of Chironomus costatus 
      and the nymphs of Diplonychus rusticus. Lethal concentration values of soapnut
      extract to these nontarget insects were always threefold or fivefold higher than 
      those that produced 100% mortality of the larvae of the three mosquito species
      examined. The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that the aqueous kernel 
      extract of S. emarginatus has potent antimosquito activity detectable against all
      the developmental stages of three important vector mosquito species as well as it
      is safe for nontarget aquatic organisms, and thus this new botanical resource
      could be used as an eco-friendly alternative biocidal agent in control of
      mosquitoes.

      area comprised 22 villages that were randomized into three clusters and
      designated as Olyset net, untreated net, and no net area. Malaria incidence in
      the study population was measured through longitudinal active surveillance at
      fortnightly intervals. There was a reduction of 65-70% in malaria incidence in
      Olyset net area as compared to the control areas. The attack rate of Plasmodium
      falciparum or number of episodes per person per year in different age groups also
      showed significant reduction in Olyset net area as compared to untreated net and 
      no net areas. Cross-sectional point prevalence surveys showed 45.7% reduction of 
      malaria prevalence in Olyset net users, whereas there was an increase of 33.3%
      and 51% in untreated net and no net villages respectively. The compliance rate of
      Olyset net usage in the study population was 80-98% during different months,
      whereas it was between 70% and 90% for untreated nets. There were minimal
      complains of skin irritation (4%), itching (8%) and eye irritation (1.2%).
      However, these effects were only transitory in nature lasting for few hours of
      the first usage. Olyset nets also provided collateral benefits in terms of relief
      not only from mosquitoes and malaria but also from other household pests such as 
      head lice, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants and houseflies. The Olyset nets were found
      to be safe to humans as no adverse event was recorded in the net users that can
      be attributed to the use of net. The study showed that Olyset nets are effective 
      personal protection tool that can be used in a community based intervention
      programme.

AB  - Four sibling species in the Anopheles sundaicus complex have earlier been
      reported, including species D from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India where
      it constitutes 58% of all Anopheles population and is a major malaria vector.
      Earlier, we have reported the identical sequences for ribosomal DNA markers among
      the specimens of A. sundaicus from Andaman and Nicobar islands irrespective of
      their habitat. These ITS2 sequences were also identical to the reported sequence 
      of variant III of Southeast Asian A. sundaicus. In the present study, we describe
      variations in three mitochondrial DNA markers among these specimens from Andaman 
      and Nicobar islands. There were two different genotypes for each locus of COI and
      COII, and three genotypes for cytochrome-b (Cyt-b) locus resulting in three
      different combined genotypes (genotypes I, II and III) in the population.
      Specimens with combined genotype I (59%, n=100) were found only among the A.
      sundaicus population breeding in fresh water whereas two different multi-loci
      genotypes i.e. genotype II (25%, n=100) and genotype III (16%, n=100) were
      present in the population breeding in brackish water. Thus, the A. sundaicus
      population breeding in fresh water was homogenous with single multi-loci genotype
      and can be distinguished from the heterogenous mosquito population breeding in
      brackish water with these markers. These Cyt-b and COI sequences of A. sundaicus 
      species D were also different from the reported Southeast Asian species of A.
      sundaicus.

      culicifacies sensu lato.
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies s.l., a major malaria vector in India, has
      developed widespread resistance to DDT and is becoming resistant to
      pyrethroids-the only insecticide class recommended for the impregnation of bed
      nets. Knock-down resistance due to a point mutation in the voltage gated sodium
      channel at L1014 residue (kdr) is a common mechanism of resistance to DDT and
      pyrethroids. The selection of this resistance may pose a serious threat to the
      success of the pyrethroid-impregnated bed net programme. This study reports the
      presence of kdr mutation (L1014F) in a field population of An. culicifacies s.l. 
      and three new PCR-based methods for kdr genotyping. METHODS: The IIS4-IIS5 linker
      to IIS6 segments of the para type voltage gated sodium channel gene of DDT and
      pyrethroid resistant An. culicifacies s.l. population from the Surat district of 
      India was sequenced. This revealed the presence of an A-to-T substitution at
      position 1014 leading to a leucine-phenylalanine mutation (L1014F) in a few
      individuals. Three molecular methods viz. Allele Specific PCR (AS-PCR), an
      Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) and Primer Introduced Restriction
      Analysis-PCR (PIRA-PCR) were developed and tested for kdr genotyping. The
      specificity of the three assays was validated following DNA sequencing of the
      samples genotyped. RESULTS: The genotyping of this An. culicifacies s.l.
      population by the three PCR based assays provided consistent result and were in
      agreement with DNA sequencing result. A low frequency of the kdr allele mostly in
      heterozygous condition was observed in the resistant population. Frequencies of
      the different genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. CONCLUSION: The
      Leu-Phe mutation, which generates the kdr phenotype in many insects, was detected
      in a pyrethroid and DDT resistant An. culicifacies s.l. population. Three
      PCR-based methods were developed for kdr genotyping. All the three assays were
      specific. The ARMS method was refractory to non-specific amplification in
      non-stringent amplification conditions. The PIRA-PCR assay is able to detect both
      the codons for the phenylalanine mutation at kdr locus, i.e., TTT and TTC, in a
      single assay, although the latter codon was not found in the population
      genotyped.

PG  - 255-61
AB  - Acetone extracts of leaves and seeds from the Tribulus terrestris
      (Zygophyllaceae) were tested against mature and immature different mosquito
      vectors under laboratory condition. The extract showed strong larvicidal,
      properties 100 per cent mortality in the 3rd-instar larvae was observed in the
      bioassays with An. culicifacies Giles species A, An. stephensi Liston, Culex
      quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes aegypti Linn, against 200 ppm of the leaf acetone 
      extract and 100 ppm seed acetone extract. The LC50 values of leaf acetone extract
      estimated for 3rd-instars An. culicifacies species A, An. stephensi, Cx.
      quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti after 24 hour of exposure were 117, 124, 168 and
      185 ppm respectively. The LC50 values of seed acetone extract estimated for
      3rd-instars An. culicifacies species A, An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and
      Ae. aegypti after 24 hour of exposure were 100, 72, 91 and 91 ppm respectively.
      It is confirmed from the LC50 values that the seed acetone extract of T.
      terrestris is more effective compared to leaf extracts. A significant (P<0.004)
      higher concentration of acetone extract leaf was required to kill equal number of
      larvae i.e. against acetone extract of seed. The seed acetone extract showed
      strong repellent activity against adults mosquitoes. Per cent protection obtained
      against Anopheles culicifacies species A 100% repellency in 1 h, 6 h; Anopheles
      stephensi 100% repellency in 0 h, 4 h, 6 h; and Culex quinquefasciatus 100%
      repellency in 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, at 10% concentration respectively. Against Deet-
      2.5% An. culicifacies Giles species A has shown 100% repellency in 1 h, 2 h, 6 h,
      An. stephensi Liston 99% repellency in 4 h, and Culex quinquefasciatus Say has
      shown 100% repellency in 1 h, 2 h.

      similar species.
PG  - 1204-24
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2009.06.021 [doi]
AB  - Studies on the relationship of various vectors and non-vectors of malaria from
      the evolutionary point of view are important. Use of molecular methods to define 
      phylogeny helps to understand the interrelationship among the members of the
      anophelines and elucidate the ambiguity that has arisen from improper
      classification. It could also help to design molecular markers for species
      differentiation, particularly in those which pose difficulty when classified,
      based on morphological features. In the present study, the phylogenetic
      relationships among the species of the anophelines of subgenus Cellia are
      inferred from the mitochondrial genes COI and COII, the ribosomal RNA gene, in
      particular the D3 region, and Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region. The
      molecular phylogeny obtained in this work matches with that of the classical
      morphological taxonomy reasonably well, and was useful in properly defining
      species positions and resolving the ambiguity that normally arises due to
      morphological taxonomy. The correct arrangement of the various anopheline taxa as
      per the traditional morphological character-based classification of anophelines
      was there when we considered the D3 region of 28S rRNA gene and ITS2 region of
      rDNA. However, the arrangement of the taxa did not match with that of the
      morphological classification in some aspects, when we considered the COI and COII
      region of mitochondrial DNA. It may have been due to the variable degree of the
      rate of evolution of the different genes within the organism. Thus, a proper
      selection of those particular genes that evolve at the rate that is reflected at 
      the species differentiation level, could help to construct the correct
      phylogenetic relationship among the anophelines and could be used to correlate
      with the grouping pattern done from the morphological perspective.

TI  - The genetics of green thorax, a new larval colour mutant, non-linked with ruby - 
      eye locus in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles stephensi, an important vector of malaria
      continues to be distributed widely in the Indian subcontinent. The natural vigour
      of the species combined with its new tolerance, indeed resistance to insecticides
      has made it obligatory that we look for control methods involving genetic
      manipulation. Hence, there is an immediate need for greater understanding of the 
      genetics of this vector species. One of the requirements for such genetic studies
      is the establishment of naturally occurring mutants, establishment of the genetic
      basis for the same and use of such mutants in the genetic transformation studies 
      and other genetic control programme(s). This paper describes the isolation and
      genetic studies of a larval colour mutant, green thorax (gt), and linkage studies
      involving another autosomal recessive mutant ruby- eye (ru) in An. stephensi.
      METHODS: After the initial discovery, the mutant green thorax was crossed inter
      se and pure homozygous stock of the mutant was established. The stock of the
      mutant ruby- eye, which has been maintained as a pure stock in the laboratory.
      Crosses were made between the wild type and mutant, green thorax to determine the
      mode of inheritance of green thorax. For linkage studies, crosses were made
      between the mutant green thorax and another autosomal recessive mutant ruby-eye. 
      The percentage cross-over was calculated for the genes linkage relationship for
      gt and gt ru. RESULTS: Results of crosses between mutant and wild type showed
      that the inheritance of green thorax (gt) in An. stephensi is monofactorial in
      nature. The gt allele is recessive to wild type and is autosomal. The linkage
      studies showed no linkage between ru and gt. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The
      mutant gt represents an excellent marker for An. stephensi as it is expressed in 
      late III instar stage of larvae and is prominent in IV instar and pupal stages
      with complete penetrance and high viability. The said mutant could be easily
      identified without the aid of a microscope. This mutant can be used extensively
      to conduct basic and applied research. The mutant has been maintained in two
      large cages in our laboratory.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) formulation against
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of
      deaths every year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has
      caused physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to 
      high operational cost. Insecticides of botanical origin have been reported as
      useful for control of mosquitoes. Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) and its derived 
      products have shown a variety of insecticidal properties. The present paper
      discusses the larvicidal activity of neem-based biopesticide for the control of
      mosquitoes. METHODS: Larvicidal efficacy of an emulsified concentrate of neem oil
      formulation (neem oil with polyoxyethylene ether, sorbitan dioleate and
      epichlorohydrin) developed by BMR & Company, Pune, India, was evaluated against
      late 3rd and early 4th instar larvae of different genera of mosquitoes. The
      larvae were exposed to different concentrations (0.5-5.0 ppm) of the formulation 
      along with untreated control. Larvicidal activity of the formulation was also
      evaluated in field against Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitoes. The
      formulation was diluted with equal volumes of water and applied @ 140 mg
      a.i./m(2) to different mosquito breeding sites with the help of pre calibrated
      knapsack sprayer. Larval density was determined at pre and post application of
      the formulation using a standard dipper. RESULTS: Median lethal concentration
      (LC(50)) of the formulation against Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus
      and Aedes aegypti was found to be 1.6, 1.8 and 1.7 ppm respectively. LC(50)
      values of the formulation stored at 26 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 45 degrees C
      for 48 hours against Ae. aegypti were 1.7, 1.7, 1.8 ppm while LC(90) values were 
      3.7, 3.7 and 3.8 ppm respectively. Further no significant difference in LC(50)
      and LC(90) values of the formulation was observed against Ae. aegypti during 18
      months storage period at room temperature. An application of the formulation at
      the rate of 140 mg a.i./m(2) in different breeding sites under natural field
      conditions provided 98.1% reduction of Anopheles larvae on day 1; thereafter 100%
      reduction was recorded up to week 1 and more than 80% reduction up to week 3,
      while percent reduction against Culex larvae was 95.5% on day 1, and thereafter
      80% reduction was achieved up to week 3. The formulation also showed 95.1% and,
      99.7% reduction of Aedes larvae on day 1 and day 2 respectively; thereafter 100% 
      larval control was observed up to day 7. CONCLUSION: The neem oil formulation was
      found effective in controlling mosquito larvae in different breeding sites under 
      natural field conditions. As neem trees are widely distributed in India, their
      formulations may prove to be an effective and eco-friendly larvicide, which could
      be used as an alternative for malaria control.

TI  - Longitudinal studies of Japanese encephalitis virus infection in vector
      mosquitoes in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh, South India.
PG  - 633-9
AB  - A 4-yr (2002-2006) entomological study was carried out in Kurnool district,
      Andhra Pradesh state, south India, to identify the mosquito vectors of Japanese
      encephalitis virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, JEV). In total, 37,139
      female mosquitoes belonging five genera and 18 species resting on vegetation were
      collected in villages and periurban areas at dusk. Mosquito species composition
      and pattern of JEV infection in mosquitoes varied in periurban and rural areas.
      In periurban area, Culex gelidus Theobald was abundant, making up 49.7% of total 
      catch followed by Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (44.5%). In rural area, Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus was predominant, making up 78.9% of total catch followed by
      Culex quinquefasciatus Say (10.8%), Anopheles subpictus Grassi (7.1%), and Cx.
      gelidus (1.1%). In light trap collections, Cx. gelidus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus 
      predominated in periurban and rural areas, respectively. Of 50,145 mosquitoes
      screened JEV isolations were made only from Cx. gelidus and Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus. Based on high abundance and frequent JEV isolation, Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus was found to be the principal vector in both areas, whereas Cx.
      gelidus plays a secondary vector role in periurban areas only.

TI  - A unique methodology for detecting the spread of chloroquine-resistant strains of
      Plasmodium falciparum, in previously unreported areas, by analyzing anophelines
      of malaria endemic zones of Orissa, India.
PG  - 462-7
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2009.01.005 [doi]
AB  - Generally, clinical data is referred to study drug-resistance patterns of
      Plasmodium falciparum in an area. This is only possible after a clear
      manifestation of drug-resistance parasites inside the human host, and thereafter 
      detection by healthcare persons. The detection of spread of drug-resistant P.
      falciparum in a population, before any pathological symptoms detected in humans
      is possible by analyzing the anopheline vectors, transmitting malaria. In the
      present study we implemented a new strategy to detect the spread of
      chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains of P. falciparum by the major malaria vectors
      prevalent in selected endemic regions of Orissa, India. We screened P. falciparum
      positive vectors by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay and
      thereafter detected K76T mutation in the Pfcrt gene, the chloroquine-resistance
      marker, of parasites present within the vectors. This study showed higher
      transmission rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum parasites by Anopheles
      culicifacies and Anopheles fluviatilis. This study will help in assigning
      chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum sporozoite transmission potential of malaria 
      vectors and suggest that by adopting the mentioned methodologies, we can detect
      the spreading of the drug-resistant P. falciparum in its transmission. This
      approach of studying the anophelines during regular vector collection and
      epidemiological analysis will give the knowledge of chloroquine-resistance
      pattern of P. falciparum of an area and help in devising effective malaria
      control strategy.

TI  - Bacterial diversity analysis of larvae and adult midgut microflora using
      culture-dependent and culture-independent methods in lab-reared and
      field-collected Anopheles stephensi-an Asian malarial vector.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-9-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes are intermediate hosts for numerous disease causing
      organisms. Vector control is one of the most investigated strategy for the
      suppression of mosquito-borne diseases. Anopheles stephensi is one of the vectors
      of malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The parasite undergoes major developmental 
      and maturation steps within the mosquito midgut and little is known about
      Anopheles-associated midgut microbiota. Identification and characterization of
      the mosquito midgut flora is likely to contribute towards better understanding of
      mosquito biology including longevity, reproduction and mosquito-pathogen
      interactions that are important to evolve strategies for vector control
      mechanisms. RESULTS: Lab-reared and field-collected A. stephensi male, female and
      larvae were screened by "culture-dependent and culture-independent" methods. Five
      16S rRNA gene library were constructed form lab and field-caught A. stephensi
      mosquitoes and a total of 115 culturable isolates from both samples were analyzed
      further. Altogether, 68 genera were identified from midgut of adult and larval A.
      stephensi, 53 from field-caught and 15 from lab-reared mosquitoes. A total of 171
      and 44 distinct phylotypes having 85 to 99% similarity with the closest database 
      matches were detected among field and lab-reared A. stephensi midgut,
      respectively. These OTUs had a Shannon diversity index value of 1.74-2.14 for
      lab-reared and in the range of 2.75-3.49 for field-caught A. stephensi
      mosquitoes. The high species evenness values of 0.93 to 0.99 in field-collected
      adult and larvae midgut flora indicated the vastness of microbial diversity
      retrieved by these approaches. The dominant bacteria in field-caught adult male
      A. stephensi were uncultured Paenibacillaceae while in female and in larvae it
      was Serratia marcescens, on the other hand in lab-reared mosquitoes, Serratia
      marcescens and Cryseobacterium meninqosepticum bacteria were found to be
      abundant. CONCLUSION: More than fifty percent of the phylotypes were related to
      uncultured class of bacteria. Interestingly, several of the bacteria identified
      are related to the known symbionts in other insects. Few of the isolates
      identified in our study are found to be novel species within the
      gammaproteobacteria which could not be phylogenetically placed within known
      classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the
      midgut microbiota of A. stephensi from lab-reared and field-collected adult and
      larvae using "culture-dependent and independent methods".

TI  - Fighting malaria in Madhya Pradesh (Central India): are we losing the battle?
PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-93 [doi]
AB  - Malaria control in Madhya Pradesh is complex because of vast tracts of forest
      with tribal settlement. Fifty four million individuals of various ethnic origins,
      accounting for 8% of the total population of India, contributed 30% of total
      malaria cases, 60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths in the
      country. Ambitious goals to control tribal malaria by launching "Enhanced Malaria
      Control Project" (EMCP) by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme
      (NVBDCP), with the World Bank assistance, became effective in September 1997 in
      eight north Indian states. Under EMCP, the programme used a broader mix of new
      interventions, i.e. insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying houses with effective 
      residual insecticides, use of larvivorous fishes, rapid diagnostic tests for
      prompt diagnosis, treatment of the sick with effective radical treatment and
      increased public awareness and IEC. However, the challenge is to scale up these
      services.A retrospective analysis of data on malaria morbidity and associated
      mortality reported under the existing surveillance system of the Madhya Pradesh
      (Central India) for the years 1996-2007 was carried out to determine the impact
      of EMCP on malaria morbidity and associated mortality. Analysis revealed that
      despite the availability of effective intervention tools for the prevention and
      control of malaria, falciparum malaria remains uncontrolled and deaths due to
      malaria have increased. Precisely, the aim of this epidemiological analysis is to
      draw lessons applicable to all international aid efforts, bureaucracy, policy
      makers and programme managers in assessing its project performance as a new
      Global Malaria Action Plan is launched with ambitious goal of reducing malaria
      and its elimination by scaling up the use of existing tools.

TI  - The development and evaluation of a single step multiplex PCR for simultaneous
      detection of Anopheles annularis group mosquitoes, human host preference and
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite presence.

AB  - The Anopheles annularis group mosquitoes, subgenus Cellia Theobald (Diptera:
      Culicidae), includes five recognized species: An. annularis Van der Wulp, An.
      nivipes Theobald, An. pallidus Theobald, An. philippinensis Ludlow and An.
      schueffneri Stanton. From these five, the three most common species found in
      Orissa were considered for this study because of their remarkable vectorial and
      behavioral variation and the important role they play in malaria transmission. To
      identify and understand their role in malaria transmission we developed a single 
      multiplex PCR-based assay. This assay included the detection of human blood
      feeding habit and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite presence. Of the 186 An.
      annularis mosquitoes collected, morphological character-based identification
      showed that 94 were An. annularis, 54 were An. philippinensis and 38 were An.
      pallidus. However, the multiplex PCR assay confirmed that 91 were An. annularis, 
      56 were An. philippinensis and 39 were An. pallidus individuals after adjustments
      were made for misidentified specimens in the morphological method. Anopheles
      annularis and An. philippinensis were found positive for human blood, and two
      samples of An. annularis species were positive for P. falciparum sporozoites.
      This one-step PCR-based method constitutes a very powerful tool in large surveys 
      of anopheline populations.

TI  - Field evaluation of Olyset nets: a long-lasting insecticidal net against malaria 
      vectors Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles fluviatilis in a hyperendemic tribal
      area of Orissa, India.
PG  - 342-50
AB  - A village-scale trial was conducted on the efficacy of Olyset nets: a
      long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) factory treated with 2% wt:wt permethrin
      against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies Giles and Anopheles fluviatilis
      James, in Sundargarh District, Orissa, India. The study area comprised 22
      villages that were randomized into three clusters and designated as Olyset net,
      untreated net, and no net clusters. Baseline studies showed that both vector
      species were 100% susceptible to permethrin. Results of wash resistance and
      bioefficacy of Olyset nets showed 100% mortality in An. culicifacies up to 11
      washings, whereas 100% mortality was observed in An. fluviatilis even after 20
      washings. The median knock-down time for these species ranged between 4.55-6.00
      and 4.45-5.45 min, respectively, during 1 yr of intervention. In the Olyset net
      study area, there was a significant reduction of 80.6, 94.1, and 76.7% in the
      entry rate of An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, and other anopheline species,
      respectively, with an overall reduction of 63.5% in total mosquitoes. Floor sheet
      collections in houses with Olyset nets indicated 39% immediate mortality in total
      mosquitoes. The overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the trial village
      was only 18.0% in comparison to 44.2 and 79.1% in villages with untreated nets
      and no nets, respectively. A significant reduction was also recorded in parity
      rate and human blood index of vector species in the Olyset net area. This study
      showed that Olyset nets are an effective personal protection tool that can be
      used in a community-based intervention program.

      protein.
PG  - 106-11
LID - 10.1016/j.jip.2009.03.005 [doi]
AB  - Certain strains of Bacillus sphaericus produce a highly toxic mosquito-larvicidal
      binary toxin during sporulation. The binary toxin is composed of toxic BinA
      (41.9kDa) and receptor binding BinB (51.4kDa) polypeptides and is active against 
      vectors of filariasis, encephalitis and malaria. The toxin has been tested with
      limited use for the control of vector mosquitoes for more than two decades. The
      binA gene from a local ISPC-8 strain of B. sphaericus that is highly toxic to
      Culex and Anopheles mosquito species was cloned into pET16b and expressed in
      Escherichia coli. The purified BinA protein differs by one amino acid (R197M)
      from BinA of the highest toxicity strains 1593/2362/C3-41. Majority of the
      expressed protein was observed in inclusion bodies. BinA inclusions alone from E.
      coli did not show toxic activity, like reported previously. However, the active
      form of BinA could be purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of E.
      coli cell lysate, grown at reduced temperature after isopropyl
      beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The purified BinA protein with and
      without poly-histidine tag showed LC(50) dose of 82.3 and 66.9ngml(-1),
      respectively, at 48h against Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. The secondary
      structure of BinA is expected to be mainly beta strands as estimated using far-UV
      circular dichroism. The estimates matched well with the secondary structure
      predictions using amino acid sequence. This is the first report of large-scale
      purification and accurate toxicity estimation of soluble B. sphaericus BinA. This
      can help in design and synthesis of improved bacterial insecticide.

AB  - Essential oil of seeds of Trachyspermum ammi (Linn.) Sprauge and its pure
      constituent thymol showed promising results when evaluated for larvicidal,
      oviposition-deterrent, vapor toxicity, and repellent activity against malarial
      vector, Anopheles stephensi. Thymol was 1.6-fold more toxic than the oil toward
      fourth-instar larvae of A. stephensi with LD(50) values of 48.88 and 80.77
      microg/ml, respectively. Egg laying by female adults of A. stephensi was much
      significantly reduced when exposed to vapors of thymol compared to the oil of T. 
      ammi seeds, and similar effects were recorded for subsequent egg hatching and
      larval survival. Vapor toxicity assay showed LC(50) value of 79.5 mg/mat for
      thymol against adults of A. stephensi, whereas the crude oil exhibited the LC(50)
      value of 185.4 mg/mat. Thymol provided complete repellency toward A. stephensi
      adults at the dose of 25.0 mg/mat after 1 h duration, whereas same degree of
      repellency was obtained by the oil at the dose of 55.0 mg/mat, indicating its
      double-fold activity than the oil.

      methanol dried leaf, flower, and seed extracts of Achyranthes aspera L.,
      Anisomeles malabarica (L.) R. Br., Gloriosa superba L., Psidium guajava L.,
      Ricinus communis L., and Solanum trilobatum L. tested against the larvae of
      cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini 1887) (Acari:
      Ixodidae), sheep internal parasite Paramphistomum cervi (Zeder 1790) (Digenea:

      Grassi and Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) at 1,000 ppm. All
      plant extracts showed moderate effects after 24 h of exposure; however, the
      highest parasite mortality was found in the leaf ethyl acetate extract of A.
      aspera, leaf methanol extract of A. malabarica, flower methanol extract of G.
      superba, and leaf methanol extract of R. communis against the larvae of R.
      microplus (LC(50) = 265.33, 95.97, 153.73, and 181.49 ppm; LC(90) = 1,130.18,
      393.88, 1,794.25, and 1,829.94 ppm); leaf acetone and chloroform of A.
      malabarica, flower acetone extract of G. superba, and leaf chloroform and
      methanol of R. communis against the adult of P. cervi (LC(50) = 108.07, 106.69,
      157.61, 69.44, and 168.24 ppm; LC(90) = 521.77, 463.94, 747.02, 256.52, and
      809.45 ppm); leaf ethyl acetate extract of A. aspera, leaf chloroform extract of 
      A. malabarica, flower methanol of G. superba, and leaf methanol extract of R.
      communis against the larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) = 48.83, 135.36, 106.77, and 
      102.71 ppm; LC(90) = 225.36, 527.24, 471.90, and 483.04 ppm); and leaf ethyl
      acetate extract of A. aspera, leaf chloroform extract of A. malabarica, flower
      methanol extract of G. superba, and leaf methanol extract of R. communis against 
      the larvae of C. tritaeniorhynchus (LC(50) = 68.27, 95.98, 59.51, and 93.94 ppm; 
      LC(90) = 306.88, 393.83, 278.99, and 413.27 ppm), respectively. These results
      suggest that the leaf ethyl acetate extract of A. aspera, leaf acetone and
      chloroform extract of A. malabarica, flower methanol extract of G. superba, and
      leaf methanol extract of R. communis have the potential to be used as an ideal
      eco-friendly approach for the control of the R. microplus, P. cervi, A.
      subpictus, and C. tritaeniorhynchus. Therefore, this study provides the first
      report on the larvae and adult parasitic activity of crude solvent extracts,
      indigenous plants consumed by the natives in southern India.

PG  - 139-46
AB  - Mosquitoes act as vectors for several diseases including malaria and filaria. In 
      Indian scenario, Chhattisgarh is endemic for both the diseases. The present study
      on prevalence of mosquito population in block Chhura of Raipur district of
      Chhattisgarh state was undertaken between August 2002 and March 2004 to asses the
      distribution pattern of various species of mosquitoes and their seasonal
      variations. Indoor resting mosquitoes were collected from five villages by
      aspirator tube in the morning (06:00-08:00 hr) using torchlight. Adult mosquitoes
      were identified using standard morphological and pictorial keys. Altogether 11
      species belonging to three genera viz., Anopheles (7 species), Armigeres (1
      species) and Culex (3 species) were recorded during study period. Average
      man-hour mosquito density was high in February 2003 (62.15) & March 2003 (69.35) 
      and declined gradually till June 2003. From July 2003, it started rising again
      and reached a peak in August (94.10)-September (91.60) 2003. The vector species
      i.e. Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles annularis were recorded high in rainy
      and winter seasons.

      leaf extract after 24, 48 and 72 hr, respectively at LC90 level. However at LC50 
      level the corresponding values were 3.22, 1.83 and 1.19, respectively. The
      petroleum ether extract of C. anthelminticum fruits is a promising source for the
      control of Anopheles larvae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the wash resistance and efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal 
      nets (LLINs), namely Olyset Net and PermaNet 2.0; and a long-lasting treatment
      kit, K-O Tab 1-2-3, on Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi, major malaria
      vectors in India, by bioassays. Conventionally treated deltamethrin net (CTDN
      with K-O Tab) was used for comparison. METHOD: Mortality and median time for
      knockdown (MTKD) of mosquitoes were determined using contact bioassays and ball
      frame bioassays respectively. Hand washing and machine washing were used.
      RESULTS: LLINs showed good bio-efficacy against An. culicifacies and An.
      stephensi. The mortality of mosquitoes remained >80% after up to 20 hand washes
      and up to 15 machine washes on all LLINs tested. No significant differences were 
      observed in mortalities between the An. culicifacies and An. stephensi in cone
      bioassays (P > 0.05). MTKD increased progressively with successive washes and
      there was a significant difference in median time for knockdown of test
      mosquitoes and between hand-washed and machine-washed nets (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: LLINs are more efficacious and last longer when washed by hand than
      by machine.

PG  - 604-7
AB  - For mosquito vector population monitoring, a new commercial trap, Mosquito Magnet
      Pro (MM-PRO), was tested for its usefulness in Goa, India. Anopheles stephensi
      was tested for the presence of Plasmodium sporozoite infection in the salivary
      glands. Using the MM-PRO 24 h a day for 34 days, 2,329 mosquitoes belonging to 16
      species were collected. These included 6 species each of the genera Anopheles and
      Culex, 2 species of Aedes, and 1 each of Mansonia and Armigeres. Most (91%) of
      the mosquitoes caught were females. Among these the number and percentage of each
      species were Anopheles stephensi 59 (2.78%), Culex quinquefasciatus 1013
      (47.78%), Culex vishnui 551 (26.0%), Mansonia uniformis 216 (10.19%), and Aedes
      albopictus 1 (0.04%). Of the 54 An. stephensi females tested for the presence of 
      circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by an ELISA technique, 1 was found to be
      Plasmodium falciparum CSP positive. The MM-PRO device was found useful for
      mosquito population sampling in the urban setting of Goa.

TI  - Utility of the rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay in detecting the life stages of species S of
      Anopheles fluviatilis complex.
PG  - 630-3
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Anopheles fluviatilis, which ranks second among the major
      malarial vectors in India occurs as a complex of three morphologically identical 
      species (species S, T and U) of which only species S is a vector. Hence, it
      becomes pertinent to have a method for the detection of this vector species under
      field conditions to map the distribution of this vector. An rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay
      has been developed earlier for species S of this complex using female adult
      specimens. In order to widen the range of samples on which this technique can be 
      employed, the utility of this PCR assay in detecting different life
      stages/gender/parts of the vector species was studied. Also, its reliability in
      detecting a single species S in pools of species T was studied. METHODS:
      Mosquitoes were collected from Malkangiri and Koraput districts of Orissa State
      where species S and T of this complex are reported. The wild caught fed females, 
      after egg laying were subjected to PCR assay for species identification. The F1
      progeny of a few PCR identified specimens was raised and samples at larval, pupal
      and adult stages were used for PCR assay. Single adult specimen of species S was 
      added to pools containing different numbers of adults of species T and the pools 
      were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR assay. RESULTS: The PCR assay could
      detect species S from pure DNA extracts of the immature stages and crude DNA
      extracts of parts of adult/whole adult mosquito of either gender. Crude DNA
      extracts of pools of mosquitoes had to be diluted and used in order to obtain the
      species diagnostic fragment. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay
      producing an amplicon of 350 bp. diagnostic for species S, could detect all
      stages/gender. Any part of the adult can be used for species identification.
      Further, a single adult of species S in pools of as many as 99 adults of species 
      T could be detected. Application of this PCR assay will be useful in mapping the 
      distribution of species S, an important malarial vector.

AB  - Anopheles subpictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus have developed resistance to
      various synthetic insecticides, making its control increasingly difficult.
      Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol
      techniques in the future. The leaf acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane,
      and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb, Andrographis
      lineata Wallich ex Nees., Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees.,
      Cocculus hirsutus (L.) Diels, Eclipta prostrata L., and Tagetes erecta L. were
      tested against fourth-instar larvae of malaria vector, A. subpictus Grassi and
      Japanese encephalitis vector, C. tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae).
      All plant extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure at
      1,000 ppm; however, the highest larval mortality was found in leaf ethyl acetate 
      of A. marmelos, E. prostrata, hexane, methanol of A. paniculata and C. hirsutus
      against the larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) = 167.00, 78.28, 67.24, 142.83 ppm;
      LC(90) = 588.31, 360.75, 371.91, and 830.01 ppm) and against the larvae of C.
      tritaeniorhynchus (LC(50) = 99.03, 119.89, 88.50, 105.19 ppm; LC(90) = 479.23,
      564.85, 416.39, and 507.86 ppm), respectively. These results suggest that the
      leaf hexane extract of A. paniculata and ethyl acetate extract of E. prostrata
      have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control
      of the A. subpictus and C. tritaeniorhynchus. Therefore, this study provides
      first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of plant extracts against
      vectors from Southern India.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of botanical insecticides to reduce the
      use of synthetic pesticides in order to avoid environmental side effects.
      Anopheles stephensi is the primary vector of urban malaria, an endemic disease in
      India. So, an effort to assay An. stephensi larvae with gall extracts of Quercus 
      infectoria was made under laboratory conditions at Mysore. Ethyl-acetate extract 
      was found to be the most effective of all the five extracts tested for larvicidal
      activity against the fourth instar larvae, with LC(50) of 116.92 ppm followed by 
      gallotannin, n-butanol, acetone, and methanol with LC(50) values of 124.62,
      174.76, 299.26, and 364.61 ppm, respectively. The efficacy in killing mosquito
      larvae may make this plant promising for the development of new botanical
      larvicide.

PG  - 271-7

AB  - A multiplex PCR assay was developed using the sequences of the D2 region of 28S
      ribosomal DNA (rDNA) to discriminate the five members of the Anopheles
      culicifacies complex provisionally designated as species A, B, C, D and E. Two
      minus strand primers derived from sequence differences in the D2 variable region 
      and a universal plus strand primer derived from the conserved 28S (rDNA) has
      delimited five members into species A and D (group 1) and species B, C and E
      (group 2) in a PCR diagnostic assay. The complete 28S rDNA-D2 region sequence of 
      A. culicifacies sibling species is reported for the first time. Inter-specific
      sequence divergence was greater than the intra-specific divergence. The
      phylogenetic relationships inferred from maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony
      and the neighbor joining analysis confirmed the presence of two unambiguous
      monophyly clades one consisting of species A and D and the other of species B, C 
      and E and that the A. culicifacies sibling species diverged relatively recently
      in evolutionary terms despite their considerable differences in bionomics.

TI  - Salivary gland transcriptome analysis during Plasmodium infection in malaria
      vector Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 636-46
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.07.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the tissue-specific molecular cross-talk mechanism
      during the mosquito-parasite interaction is of prime importance in the design of 
      new strategies for malaria control. Because mosquito salivary glands are the
      final destination for the parasite maturation and transmission of vector-borne
      diseases, identification and characterization of salivary genes and their
      products are equally important in order to access their effect on the infectivity
      of the parasite. During the last five years there have been several studies on
      the sialomes of Anopheles mosquitoes, however very limited information is
      available on the changes in the salivary gland transcriptome in the presence of
      Plasmodium, and this information is limited to the mosquito Anopheles gambiae.
      METHODS: In this study we aimed to explore and identify parasite-induced
      transcripts from the salivary glands of Anopheles stephensi, using a subtractive 
      hybridization protocol. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of expressed sequence tags
      (ESTs) showed close homology to previously known families of mosquito salivary
      gland secretary proteins, representing the induced expression of alternative
      splicing and/or additional new members of the protein family. The remaining 6% of
      ESTs did not yield significant homology to any known proteins in the
      non-redundant database and thus may represent a class of unknown/novel salivary
      proteins. Primary analysis of the ESTs also revealed identification of several
      novel immune-related transcripts, including defensin and cecropins, probably
      involved in counter-activation of the antagonistic defense system. A
      comprehensive description of each family of proteins has been discussed in
      relation to the tissue-specific mosquito-parasite interaction. CONCLUSION: This
      is the first report on the identification of new putative salivary genes,
      presumably activated during parasite infection.

AB  - Several antimicrobial/parasitic peptides are known to be upregulated in
      mosquitoes upon infection with parasites. The aim of this study was to identify
      immune-responsive genes in the vector mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say
      (Diptera: Culicidae) against the human lymphatic filarial parasite, Wuchereria
      bancrofti (Cobbold) (Spirurida: Onchocercidae). Suppression subtractive
      hybridization was performed using RNA from filarial infected and non-infected
      mosquitoes to obtain differentially expressed transcripts, and their identities
      were confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
      Out of 23 clones selected from the suppression subtractive library, three
      corresponded to antimicrobial peptide genes, defensins, and four corresponded to 
      regulatory serpin peptide genes. RT-PCR using defensin-specific primers and
      sequencing of the product showed a 284-bp defensin cDNA. Sequence alignment with 
      defensins of the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles and Aedes aegypti (L.)
      showed maximum homology with the former. Similarly, that of serpin-specific
      primers showed a 406-bp cDNA encoding serpins. Sequence alignment showed maximum 
      homology with that of An. gambiae, as in the case of defensins. Hence, this
      investigation revealed upregulation of defensins and serpins in Cx
      quinquefasciatus infected with W. bancrofti. Antimicrobial peptide genes such as 
      defensins may have limited or no specific role in regulating parasite
      development. Serpins may prove to be facilitating molecules, by regulating
      melanization of the parasite. However, the exact functions of these molecules in 
      the immune system of the vector mosquito are yet to be investigated.

LID - 908085 [pii]
AB  - Hexane extract of tuber of plant Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae) was screened under
      laboratory conditions for repellent activity against mosquito vector Anopheles
      culicifacies Giles species A (Diptera: Culicidae), Anopheles stephensi Liston
      (Diptera: Culicidae), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). The
      Cyperus rotundus tuber extract was used to determine their effect on mosquito
      vector, and comparison with the DEET (NN Diethyl 1-3 methyl Benzamide, formerly
      known as diethyl 1-m-toluamide). The tuber extracts showed more effective at all 
      the dose. Result obtained from the laboratory experiment showed that the tuber
      extracts are more effective for repellency of allthe mosquito vector even at low 
      dose. Clear dose response relationships were established with the highest dose of
      10% tuber extract evoking 100% repellency. Percent protection obtained against
      An. culicifacies Giles species A 100% repellency in 4 hours, 6 hours, An.
      stephensi 100% repellency in 6 hours and Cx. quinquefasciatus was 100% repellency
      in 6 hours at the 10% concentration. Against DEET- 2.5% An. culicifacies A 100%
      repellency in 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, An. stephensi have shown 100% repellency 
      in 6 hours, and Culex quinquefasciatus have shown 100% repellency in 1 hour, 2
      hours, 6 hours. The consolidated data of the repellency observed in different
      species is given and it is evident that the over all repellency rates varied
      between 80 and 100% for different repellents concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10%). 
      The extract can be applied as an effective personal protective measure against
      mosquito bites.

AB  - Mosquito control is facing a threat due to the emergence of resistance to
      synthetic insecticides. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable
      alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The acetone, chloroform, ethyl
      acetate, hexane, methanol and petroleum ether extracts of leaf, flower and seed
      of Cassia auriculata L., Leucas aspera (Willd.), Rhinacanthus nasutus KURZ.,
      Solanum torvum Swartz and Vitex negundo Linn. were tested against fourth instar
      larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi and Japanese encephalitis
      vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality 
      was observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal
      effects; however, the highest mortality was found in leaf petroleum ether, flower
      methanol extracts of C. auriculata, flower methanol extracts of L. aspera and R. 
      nasutus, leaf and seed methanol extracts of S. torvum and leaf hexane extract of 
      V. negundo against the larvae of A. subpictus (LC(50) = 44.21, 44.69, 53.16,
      41.07, 35.32, 28.90 and 44.40 ppm; LC(90) = 187.31, 188.29, 233.18, 142.66,
      151.60, 121.05 and 192.11 ppm, respectively) and against the larvae of C.
      tritaeniorhynchus (LC(50) = 69.83, 51.29, 81.24, 71.79, 44.42, 84.47 and 65.35
      ppm; LC(90) = 335.26, 245.63, 300.45, 361.83, 185.09, 351.41 and 302.42 ppm,
      respectively). These results suggest that the leaf petroleum ether, flower
      methanol extracts of C. auriculata, leaf and seed methanol extracts of S. torvum 
      and leaf hexane extract of V. negundo have the potential to be used as an ideal
      eco-friendly approach for the control of the A. subpictus and C.
      tritaeniorhynchus. This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity
      of the medicinal plant extracts.

TI  - Mosquito larvicidal and antimicrobial activity of protein of Solanum villosum
      leaves.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-8-62 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes are associated with the transmission of malaria, dengue,
      Japanese encephalitis, filariasis and other viral diseases throughout the globe, 
      apart from being a nuisance pest. Biological control alone or as a part of
      integrated vector management stands to be a better alternative to the chemical
      controls aimed against pest mosquitoes. At the same time it is necessary to
      control bacteria by synthetic or natural means (plant products). Hence the
      present study was designed to screen the effect of mosquito larvicidal and
      antimicrobial activitiy of protein isolated from matured leaves of Solanum
      villosum against mosquito immatures and some pathogenic bacteria. METHODS:
      Aqueous solvent extract of fresh mature leaves of S. villosum was tested against 
      3rd instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Stegomyia
      aegypti mosquitoes and against four pathogenic bacteria. The protein fraction was
      isolated and tested for mosquitocidal and antibacterial activities. Amino acid
      analysis was performed on isolated protein using PICO.TAG amino acid system.
      SDS-PAGE was also done to detect the bands of amino acid on the basis of their
      molecular weights. RESULTS: Proteins isolated from mature leaves of S. villosum
      were found to have larvicidal and antimicrobial properties. Analysis of the
      isolated protein identified fifteen amino acids of which eight were essential
      amino acids. SDS-PAGE detected seven bands corresponding to different molecular
      weights in the range of 69-109 KDa. CONCLUSION: Proteins of mature leaves of S.
      villosum exhibited moderate larvicidal and antimicrobial activities. The study
      provides considerable scope in exploiting local indigenous resources for
      isolation of antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal proteins.

TI  - Impact of lambdacyhalothrin capsule suspension treated bed nets on malaria in
      tribal villages of Malkangiri district, Orissa, India.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Insecticide treated mosquito nets are increasingly being 
      used in malaria control programmes. One of the problems with the treatment of bed
      nets with conventional formulations of insecticides was that regular washing of
      treated nets diminish insecticidal effect. Lambdacyhalothrin 2.5 capsule
      suspension (CS) (2.5% a.i., w/v), a new water-based microencapsulated formulation
      is reported to have wash-resistant property and longer persistence on the netting
      material than other formulations. We evaluated the impact of the use of nylon bed
      nets treated with lambdacyhalothrin 2.5 CS at 10 mg (a.i.)/m(2) in comparison to 
      untreated nets and no nets on malaria in tribal villages in Orissa. METHODS: Nine
      foothill villages, highly endemic for falciparum malaria, from the Primary Health
      Centre (PHC) areas of Khairput and Kudumulugumma of Malkangiri district, Orissa, 
      were divided into three groups, each with a population of about 500 and allocated
      randomly for treated (TN) and untreated nets (UN) and no nets (NN). Bed nets were
      distributed in September 2001 and retreatment was done in June 2002. The impact
      was assessed based on the changes in vector density, parous rate, malaria
      incidence and parasite rates. Indoor-resting collections of Anopheles fluviatilis
      and An. culicifacies were made at fortnightly intervals from fixed human
      dwellings. Mass blood surveys before and after distribution of nets and
      fortnightly active surveillance were carried out to assess the change in parasite
      rates and malaria incidence. Bioassays were conducted at fortnightly intervals on
      the bed nets supplied to the villagers. RESULTS: The reductions in indoor resting
      catches of An. fluviatilis and An. culicifacies were 96 and 38 per cent in
      villages with treated nets and 2.6 and 23 per cent in villages with untreated
      nets respectively compared to no net villages. For six months following
      treatment, 100 per cent mortality of An. fluviatilis was observed on the unwashed
      nets and on the nets washed once or twice. After re-treatment, 100 per cent
      mortality of An. fluviatilis or An. culicifacies was observed for nine months
      even after two washes. Usage rates of treated and untreated nets varied
      seasonally; 58.9 and 46.3 per cent in rainy season, 48.6 and 37.1 per cent in
      winter season and 38.1 and 31.6 per cent in summer season respectively.
      Reductions in malaria parasite rates were about 65 per cent in the treated net
      villages and 39 per cent in the untreated net villages compared to no net
      villages. About 75 per cent of treated nets and 60 per cent of untreated nets
      were in usable condition 19 months after distribution. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: The estimated protection factor based on malaria incidence was 86 per
      cent for the treated nets during both post-treatment and post-retreatment periods
      and 34 and 51 per cent for untreated nets for the corresponding periods compared 
      to no nets. The results of the study showed that the use of bed nets treated nets
      with CS formulation of lambdacyhalothrin at 10 mg (a.i.)/m(2) was acceptable to
      the community and re-treatment of nets at nine-monthly intervals can
      significantly reduce density and survival of An. fluviatilis and incidence of
      falciparum malaria.

AB  - The acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane and methanol extracts of peel and 
      leaf extracts of Citrus sinensis, Ocimum canum, Ocimum sanctum and Rhinacanthus
      nasutus were tested against fourth instar larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles
      subpictus Grassi, Japanese encephalitis vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles
      (Diptera: Culicidae) and feeding deterrence to nymphs of cotton pest, Aphis
      gossypii Glover (Homoptera: Aphididae). The larval and nymph mortality were
      observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal and
      nymphicidal effects; however, the highest mortality was found in peel chloroform 
      extract of C. sinensis, leaf ethyl acetate extracts of O. canum and O. sanctum
      and leaf chloroform extract of R. nasutus against the larvae of A. subpictus
      (LC(50) = 58.25, 88.15, 21.67 and 40.46 ppm; LC(90) = 298.31, 528.70, 98.34 and
      267.20 ppm), peel methanol extract of C. sinensis, leaf methanol extract of O.
      canum, ethyl acetate extracts of O. sanctum and R. nasutus against the larvae of 
      C. tritaeniorhynchus (LC(50) = 38.15, 72.40, 109.12 and 39.32 ppm; LC(90) =
      184.67, 268.93, 646.62 and 176.39 ppm), peel hexane extract of C. sinensis, leaf 
      methanol extracts of O. canum and R. nasutus and leaf ethyl acetate extract of O.
      sanctum against the nymph of A. gossypii (LC(50) = 162.89, 80.99, 73.27 and
      130.19 ppm; LC(90) = 595.40, 293.33, 338.74 and 450.90 ppm), respectively. These 
      results suggest that the peel methanol extracts of C. sinensis and O. canum,
      ethyl acetate leaf extract of O. sanctum and leaf chloroform and ethyl acetate
      extract of R. nasutus have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly
      approach for the control of the A. subpictus, C. tritaeniorhynchus and A.
      gossypii.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of Saraca indica, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, and Clitoria
      ternatea extracts against three mosquito vector species.
PG  - 1017-25
LID - 10.1007/s00436-008-1284-x [doi]
AB  - Screening of natural products for mosquito larvicidal activity against three
      major mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Anopheles
      stephensi resulted in the identification of three potential plant extracts viz., 
      Saraca indica/asoca, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, and Clitoria ternatea for mosquito
      larval control. In the case of S. indica/asoca, the petroleum ether extract of
      the leaves and the chloroform extract of the bark were effective against the
      larvae of C. quinquefasciatus with respective LC(50) values 228.9 and 291.5 ppm. 
      The LC(50) values of chloroform extract of N. arbor-tristis leaves were 303.2,
      518.2, and 420.2 ppm against A. aegypti, A. stephensi, and C. quinquefasciatus,
      respectively. The methanol and chloroform extracts of flowers of N. arbor-tristis
      showed larvicidal activity against larvae of A. stephensi with the respective
      LC(50) values of 244.4 and 747.7 ppm. Among the methanol extracts of C. ternatea 
      leaves, roots, flowers, and seeds, the seed extract was effective against the
      larvae of all the three species with LC(50) values 65.2, 154.5, and 54.4 ppm,
      respectively, for A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. Among the
      three plant species studied for mosquito larvicidal activity, C. ternatea was
      showing the most promising mosquito larvicidal activity. The phytochemical
      analysis of the promising methanolic extract of the seed extract was positive for
      carbohydrates, saponins, terpenoids, tannins, and proteins. In conclusion,
      bioassay-guided fractionation of effective extracts may result in identification 
      of a useful molecule for the control of mosquito vectors.

TI  - Observations on sporozoite detection in naturally infected sibling species of the
      Anopheles culicifacies complex and variant of Anopheles stephensi in India.
PG  - 333-6
AB  - Sporozoites were detected in naturally infected sibling species of the primary
      rural vector Anopheles culicifacies complex in two primary health centres (PHCs) 
      and a variant of the urban vector Anopheles stephensi in Mangalore city,
      Karnataka, south India while carrying out malaria outbreak investigations from
      1998-2006. Sibling species of An. culicifacies were identified based on the
      banding patterns on ovarian polytene chromosomes, and variants of An. stephensi
      were identified based on the number of ridges on the egg floats. Sporozoites were
      detected in the salivary glands by the dissection method. Of the total 334
      salivary glands of An. culicifacies dissected, 17 (5.08%) were found to be
      positive for sporozoites. Of the 17 positive samples, 11 were suitable for
      sibling species analysis; 10 were species A (an efficient vector) and 1 was
      species B (a poor vector). Out of 46 An. stephensi dissected, one was sporozoite 
      positive and belonged to the type form (an efficient vector). In malaria
      epidemiology this observation is useful for planning an effective vector control 
      programme, because each sibling species/variant differs in host specificity,
      susceptibility to malarial parasites, breeding habitats and response to
      insecticides.

TI  - A review on Anopheles culicifacies: from bionomics to control with special
      reference to Indian subcontinent.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2008.09.017 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies, is a complex of five isomorphic sibling species A, B, C, 
      D and E and is considered to be the major malaria vector in the Indian
      subcontinent. Despite numerous studies, it is difficult to have a global view of 
      the ecological and bionomical characteristics of the individual sibling species, 
      as different identification methods have been used. Major biological and
      ecological trends such as the high plasticity of behaviour and the sympatry of
      species are addressed. In spite of the availability of rapid molecular
      identification tools, we still lack important information concerning the
      biological characteristics of each sibling species. Resistance to insecticide is 
      alarming as it has developed quadruple resistance in two states of India. An
      intensified and appropriate intervention measure to interrupt transmission is the
      call of the day. The authors focus on (1) reviewing the vectorial aspects of An. 
      culicifacies (2) discussing recently published data on bionomics of each sibling 
      species, (3) identifying lacunae in the understanding of the Culicifacies
      complex, and (4) exploring the possibility of proper control measures. Our
      understanding of the bionomics of all the five sibling species would certainly
      help, keeping in mind the climatic changes we are to face in the next few years.

TI  - Acute renal failure in a patient with severe malaria and dengue shock syndrome.
PG  - 427-30
AB  - Malaria is an infectious disease caused by plasmodium, which lives and breeds in 
      human blood cells, and is transmitted through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. 
      Renal impairment, often caused by malaria, is acute renal failure (ARF) due to
      acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Dengue virus is transmitted from human to human
      through Aedes aegypti mosquito bites. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the most
      severe stage of infection, is characterized by bleeding and shock tendencies
      (dengue shock syndrome, DSS). ARF is a less common complication in patients with 
      DHF, with an incidence of less than 10%. Mixed infections of two infectious
      agents may cause overlapping symptoms and have been reported in Africa and India.
      We report here a patient with ARF due to mixed infection of severe malaria and
      DSS. The patient presented with fever and had a history of repeated malaria
      infection. Physical examination revealed stable vital signs and
      hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data showed hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia
      and increased serum aminotransferase. Chest X-ray showed pleural effusion. A
      malarial antigen and thick smear examination showed the trophozoite stage of P.
      falciparum. On Day 3, blood pressure dropped to 80/60 mmHg, pulse was 120
      beats/minute, weak, and body temperature 36.8 C, with icterus. Other tests
      revealed an increase of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and
      serologically anti-dengue IgG antibody (+) and anti-dengue IgM antibody (-).
      Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having both malaria and DDS.
      We treated the patient with the parenteral anti-malarial agent, artemisinin.
      Supportive treatment and treatment of complications were also performed
      simultaneously for DSS. The patient experienced an oliguria episode but responded
      well to a diuretic. The patient was discharged after clinical and laboratory
      examinations showed positive progress.

      an analysis of early resistance detection.

AB  - We are reporting in this paper the control of Anopheles stephensi Liston and
      Culex quinquefasciatus Say using Bacillus sphaericus. These have been now
      considered with a practical solution because of its specific and prolonged
      killing action against mosquito larvae. The efficacy of B. sphaericus were
      assessed against all instars of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus separately. 
      During the experiments, the mortalities were not found highly effective in dose
      concentration of LC(90) 0.01 mg/l. It is recommended by the World Health
      Organizations in all instars of larvae of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus.
      Thereafter, six different concentrations were used in laboratory bioassays (05,
      10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/l) for A. stephensi. Similarly, in the case of C.
      quinquefasciatus, six statistically significant different concentrations were
      used (0.01, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/l) of B. sphaericus. It was
      recorded after exposure of 24 h. The percentages of mortalities were different
      for the different instars of C. quinquefasciatus and A. stephensi. The probit
      equations were drawn by the probit method. The result of the study distinctly
      showed that B. sphaericus is not effective on selected defined doses against A.
      stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. This probably indicates an initiation of
      resistance. This efficacy study can be useful while detecting early resistance
      phenomena in environment specific zones.

TI  - Effects of culture media on larvicidal property of secondary metabolites of
      mosquito pathogenic fungus Chrysosporium lobatum (Moniliales: Moniliaceae).
PG  - 50-4
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2008.09.013 [doi]
AB  - In order to determine the potential role of secondary metabolites of
      Chrysosporium lobatum as a biological control agent for mosquitoes, effects of
      culture media on the larvicidal property of secondary metabolites was evaluated. 
      The secondary metabolites of C. lobatum released in the Sabouraud's dextrose
      broth (SDB) and chitin broth (CB) were collected by filtering through Whatman No.
      3 chr filter after 7 days of growth. First, second and third instars of Anopheles
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus were exposed to six different concentrations
      of secondary metabolites for the calculation of LC(50) and LC(90) values. C.
      quinquefasciatus were more susceptible than A. stephensi to secondary metabolites
      in SDB and CB. The LC(50) and LC(90) values for first instars of both the
      mosquitoes were significantly lower than second and third instars. A
      significantly higher mortality was recorded in both the mosquitoes to the
      secondary metabolites in CB than SDB. In the field trial, secondary metabolites
      in CB reduced 56.3% of A. stephensi and 66.42% of C. quinquefasciatus populations
      after 5 days of application. The LT(50) of first instars of both the mosquitoes
      were lower than the second and third instars. The precipitates of the secondary
      metabolites were more effective to both the mosquitoes than the secondary
      metabolite and heat-shocked secondary metabolites. In addition, the insecticidal 
      effect of the secondary metabolites was reduced after exposure for 5 min at 120
      degrees C, suggesting that the bioactive compounds were proteinaceous. The
      secondary metabolites in CB contained proteases which may cause more mortality
      than the secondary metabolites in SDB.
