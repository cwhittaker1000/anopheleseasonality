TI  - Characterization of the 3-HKT gene in important malaria vectors in India, viz:
      Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae).

AB  - The 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (3-HKT) gene plays a vital role in the
      development of malaria parasites by participating in the synthesis of xanthurenic
      acid, which is involved in the exflagellation of microgametocytes in the midgut
      of malaria vector species. The 3-HKT enzyme is involved in the tryptophan
      metabolism of Anophelines. The gene had been studied in the important global
      malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. In this report, we have conducted a
      preliminary investigation to characterize this gene in the two important vector
      species of malaria in India, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi. The 
      analysis of the genetic structure of this gene in these species revealed high
      homology with the An. gambiae gene. However, four non-synonymous mutations in An.
      stephensi and seven in An. culicifacies sequences were noted in the exons 1 and 2
      of the gene; the implication of these mutations on enzyme structure remains to be
      explored.

TI  - Field evaluation of a previously untested strain of biolarvicide (Bacillus
      thuringiensis israelensis H14) for mosquito control in an urban area of Orissa,
      India.
PG  - 410-4
AB  - A previously untested strain of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) serotype
      H14 (ID No. VCRC B17) has been evaluated under field conditions in an urban area 
      of Rourkela city, India for its impact on the larval density of different
      mosquito species in a variety of habitats. The persistence of the biolarvicide
      used in an aqueous solution varied in different habitats. The lowest field
      application rate of 0.5 ml/m2 remained effective for about 10-12 days and
      provided 80-100% reduction in larval abundance of anopheline species, including
      Anopheles culicifacies breeding in unpolluted water bodies. However, in stagnant 
      polluted waters in drains and cesspools supporting culicine breeding, the biocide
      at the same rate persists for 5-6 days only. An application rate of 1 ml/m2 to
      stagnant drains and cesspools, resulted in 84-100% reduction in the larval
      population of Culex quinquefasciatus over a period of 2 wk. Based on the field
      observations, an operational dose of 0.5 ml/m2 at fortnightly intervals is
      suggested for clean water sources supporting anopheline breeding. However, to
      control breeding of culicine mosquitoes in stagnant and polluted waters, an
      operational dose of 1 ml/m2 at fortnightly intervals is required. The study
      showed that Bti serotype H14 (VCRC B17) is a suitable biolarvicide that can be
      used against different mosquitoes in different types of urban habitats.

AB  - An artificial neural network method is presented for classification and
      identification of Anopheles mosquito species based on the internal transcribed
      spacer2 (ITS2) data of ribosomal DNA string. The method is implemented in two
      different multi-layered feed-forward neural network model forms, namely,
      multi-input single-output neural network (MISONN) and multi-input multi-output
      neural network (MIMONN). A number of data sequences in varying sizes of different
      Anopheline malarial vectors and their corresponding species coding are employed
      to develop the neural network models. The classification efficiency of the
      network models for untrained data sequences is evaluated in terms of quantitative
      performance criteria. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the neural
      network models to extract the genetic information in ITS2 sequences and to adapt 
      to new data. The method of MISONN is found to exhibit superior performance over
      MIMONN in distinguishing and identification of the mosquito vectors.

PG  - 43-5
AB  - Larvicidal effect of neem (Azadirachta indica) and karanja (Pongamia glabra) oil 
      cakes (individuals and combination) was studied against mosquito species. Both
      the oil cakes showed larvicidal activity against the mosquito species tested. The
      combination of neem and karanja oil cakes in equal proportion proved to have
      better effect than the individual treatments. The combination of the two oil
      cakes recorded an LC95 of 0.93, 0.54 and 0.77% against the mosquitoes, Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi respectively The increase
      in efficacy of the combination treatment over individuals in all the mosquito
      larvae tested was found to range about 4 to 10 fold in terms of LC50 and 2 to 6
      fold in terms of LC95.

TI  - Potential distribution of two species in the medically important Anopheles
      minimus complex (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 852-60
AB  - Anopheles minimus Theobald (=An. minimus A) and possibly Anopheles harrisoni
      Harbach & Manguin (=An. minimus C) are important malaria vector species in the
      Minimus Complex in Southeast Asia. The distributions of these species are poorly 
      known, although detailed information could benefit malaria vector incrimination
      and control. We used published collection records of these species and
      environmental geospatial data to construct consensus ecological niche models
      (ENM) of each species' potential geographic distribution. The status of the
      Indian taxon An. fluviatilis S as a species distinct from An. harrisoni has been 
      debated in the literature, so we tested for differentiation in ecological niche
      characteristics. The predicted potential distribution of An. minimus is more
      southerly than that of An. harrisoni: Southeast Asia is predicted to be more
      suitable for An. minimus, and China and India are predicted more suitable for An.
      harrisoni, so An. harrisoni seems to dominate under cooler conditions. The
      distribution of An. minimus is more continuous than that of An. harrisoni:
      disjunction in the potential distribution of the latter is suggested between
      India and Southeast Asia Anopheles fluviatilis S occurrences are predicted within
      the An. harrisoni ecological potential, so we do not document ecological
      differentiation that might reject conspecificity. Overall, model predictions
      offer a synthetic view of the distribution of this species complex across the
      landscapes of southern and eastern Asia.

      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 337-40

AB  - The ethanolic leaf extract of Cassia obtusifolia was investigated for their
      larvicidal and oviposition deterrence effects against Anopheles stephensi.
      Concentrations ranging from 25 to 125 mg/l were assessed at 24 h post-treatment
      against late third instar larvae. The leaf extract had significant larvicidal
      effect with LC(50) and LC(90) values were 52.2 and 108.7 mg/l, respectively. In
      oviposition behaviour study, four different concentrations ranging from 100 to
      400 mg/l were studied against gravid female mosquitoes. The results of
      oviposition study indicated that the leaf extract showed concentration dependent 
      oviposition deterrent activity. At higher concentration (400 mg/l) showed 92.5%
      effective repellency against oviposition, followed by 300, 200 and 100 mg/l
      showed 87.2%, 83.0% and 75.5%, respectively. The larvicidal and oviposition
      deterrent effect of C. obtusifolia against A. stephensi make this plant product
      promising as an alternative to synthetic insecticide in mosquito control
      programs.

AB  - Anopheles dirus and Anopheles baimaii are closely related species which feed on
      primates, particularly humans, and transmit malaria in the tropical forests of
      mainland Southeast Asia. Here, we report an in-depth phylogeographic picture
      based on 269 individuals from 21 populations from mainland Southeast Asia.
      Analysis of 1537 bp of mtDNA sequence revealed that the population history of A. 
      baimaii is far more complex than previously thought. An old expansion (pre-300
      kyr BP) was inferred in northern India/Bangladesh with a wave of south-eastwards 
      expansion arriving at the Thai border (ca 135-173 kyr BP) followed by leptokurtic
      dispersal very recently (ca 16 kyr BP) into peninsular Thailand. The long and
      complex population history of these anthropophilic species suggests their
      expansions are not in response to the relatively recent (ca 40 kyr BP) human
      expansions in mainland Southeast Asia but, rather, fit well with our
      understanding of Pleistocene climatic change there.

      Liston by certain fatty acid esters.
PG  - 281-6
LID - 10.1007/s00436-008-1189-8 [doi]
AB  - The chemical factors involved in oviposition site selection by mosquitoes have
      become the focus of interest in recent years, and considerable attention is paid 
      to the chemical cues influencing mosquito oviposition. Studies on synthetic
      oviposition attractants/repellents of long-chain fatty acid esters against
      Anopheles stephensi are limited. Screening and identification of chemicals which 
      potentially attract/repel the gravid females to/or from oviposition site could be
      exploited for eco-friendly mosquito management strategies. The ester compounds
      demonstrated their ability to repel and attract the gravid A. stephensi females
      in the treated substrates. Significant level of concentration-dependent negative 
      oviposition response of mosquitoes to octadecyl propanoate, heptadecyl butanoate,
      hexadecyl pentanoate, and tetradecyl heptanoate were observed. In contrast, decyl
      undecanoate, nonyl dodecanoate, pentyl hexadecanoate, and propyl octadecanoate
      elicited concentration-dependent positive oviposition responses from the gravid
      mosquitoes. Forcing a female to retain her eggs due to unavailability of a
      suitable oviposition site and attracting them to lay the eggs in a baited
      ovitraps shall ensure effective control of mosquito breeding and population
      buildup because the oviposition bioassay target the most susceptible stage of an 
      insect life cycle. Treating relatively smaller natural breeding sites with an
      effective repellent and placing ovitraps containing an attractant in combination 
      with insect-growth regulator (IGR)/insecticide would be a promising method of
      mosquito management.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of 11 commonly available
      medicinal plants and compare its efficacy in relation to larvicidal and
      mosquitocidal activities against larvae and adults of Anopheles stephensi
      (Liston). All the medicinal plants and the mixture were effective against larvae 
      of A. stephensi as evidenced by low lethal concentration and lethal time. The
      lethality varied in adults and plant extracts of mixture; Eucalyptus globulus,
      Cymbopogan citratus, Artemisia annua, Justicia gendarussa, Myristica fragrans,
      Annona squamosa, and Centella asiatica were found to be most effective. Larval
      mortality between 80% and 100% was observed in mixture treatment, C. asiatica and
      E. globulus. The adults that emerged from all the treatments were malformed.
      Further, the treated larvae showed significant decrement in the levels of
      protein, carbohydrate, and lipids and affect negatively the presence of certain
      amino acids. The present findings have important implications in the practical
      control of mosquito larvae and adults in the aquatic ecosystem as the medicinal
      plants studied are commonly available in large quantities. These plant extracts
      are easy to prepare, inexpensive, and safe for mosquito control which might be
      used directly as larvicidal and mosquitocidal agents in small volume aquatic
      habitats or breeding sites of around human dwellings.

TI  - Elephantiasis of non-filarial origin (podoconiosis) in the highlands of
      north-western Cameroon.
PG  - 529-40
LID - 10.1179/136485908X311849 [doi]
AB  - Lymphoedema, a condition of localized fluid retention, results from a compromised
      lymphatic system. Although one common cause in the tropics is infection with
      filarial worms, non-filarial lymphoedema, also known as podoconiosis, has been
      reported among barefoot farmers in volcanic highland zones of Africa, Central and
      South America and north-western India. There are conflicting reports on the
      causes of lymphoedema in the highland regions of Cameroon, where the condition is
      of great public-health importance. To characterise the focus of lymphoedema in
      the highlands of the North West province of Cameroon and investigate its real
      causes, a cross-sectional study was carried out on the adults (aged > or =15
      years) living in the communities that fall within the Ndop and Tubah health
      districts. The subjects, who had to have lived in the study area for at least 10 
      years, were interviewed, examined clinically, and, when possible, checked for
      microfilaraemia. The cases of lymphoedema confirmed by ultrasonography and a
      random sample of the other subjects were also tested for filarial antigenaemia.
      The interviews, which explored knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP)
      relating to lymphoedema, revealed that the condition was well known, with each
      study community having a local name for it. Of the 834 individuals examined
      clinically, 66 (8.1%) had lymphoedema of the lower limb, with all the clinical
      stages of this condition represented. None of the 792 individuals examined
      parasitologically, however, had microfilariae of W. bancrofti (or any other
      filarial parasite) in their peripheral blood, and only one (0.25%) of the 399
      individuals tested for the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti gave a positive
      result. In addition, none of the 504 mosquitoes caught landing on human bait in
      the study area and dissected was found to harbour any stage of W. bancrofti.
      These findings indicate that the elephantiasis seen in the North West province of
      Cameroon is of non-filarial origin.

PG  - 607-9
AB  - Two 1 yr surveys carried out at a gap of 10 yr revealed nine anopheline species
      from malaria endemic foothills area of Ayodhya - Baghmindi range of West Bengal, 
      India, with 8.4 per cent populations of Anopheles culicifacies. An. culicifacies 
      was incriminated as vector of Plasmodium falciparum with sporozoite rate of 1.23 
      per cent. Studies on age composition indicated that proportion parous and daily
      survival rate of An. culicifacies were assessed to be 0.50 and 0.84 respectively.
      The survival rate per gonotrophic cycle averaged over the two year was 0.61.
      Rainy season was found to be the favourable period for transmission.

AB  - Efficacy of culture filtrates of five strains of Metarhizium anisopliae isolated 
      from insects were evaluated against Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. The culture filtrates released from the strains of M.
      anisopliae in the YpSs and chitin broths were filtered and used for the bioassays
      after a growth of 7 days. Among the culture filtrates of five strains, M.
      anisopliae 892 was found to be more effective against both the mosquitoes. The
      LC(50) values of culture filtrates of M. anisopliae 892 in chitin broth was lower
      than the LC(50) of culture filtrates in YpSs broth against first and fourth
      instars of both the mosquitoes. The LC(50) values of culture filtrates were
      significantly different between first and fourth instars of A. stephensi (t test;
      P = 0.0001) and C. quinquefasciatus (t test; P = 0.02). The larvae of A.
      stephensi were more susceptible than C. quinquefasciatus except in two cases.
      This is the first report of efficacy of culture filtrates produced by M.
      anisopliae in chitin broth against mosquitoes and have potential as a biological 
      control agent of mosquitoes.

PG  - 233-6
AB  - Hexane extract obtained from leaves of Eucalyptus citriodora Hook was tested
      against larvae of Anopheles stephensi Liston, Culex quinquefasciatus Say and
      Aedes aegypti Linn to assess its toxicity and growth inhibiting activity. The
      results showed better activity of hexane extract against larvae of An. stephensi 
      Liston as compared to the larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus Say and Ae. aegypti
      Linn. The LC50 values against IVth instar larvae of three species were 69.86,
      81.12 & 91.76 ppm respectively after 24 hours and 26.7, 29.9 & 38.8 ppm
      respectively after 72 hours. At lowest concentration viz. 10 ppm, 73% larvae of
      An. stephensi Liston failed to emergence as adult mosquito while in Cx.
      quinquefasciatus Say and Ae. aegypti Linn only 10 & 6% larvae failed to emerge.
      Further observations showed some morphological abnormalities in same pupae which 
      could not moult normally. These results clearly indicated growth inhibition
      effect of the hexane extract of Eucalyptus against mosquito larvae, particularly 
      Anopheles species. Thus Eucalyptus citriodora Hook, which is commonly found in
      Northern India, has a great potential for the development of an eco-friendly
      herbal insecticidal product for control of mosquito breeding.

AB  - In mosquito control programs, botanical origin may have the potential to be used 
      successfully as larvicides. The larvicidal activity of crude acetone, hexane,
      ethyl acetate, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of the leaf of Centella
      asiatica Linn., Datura metal Linn., Mukia scabrella Arn., Toddalia asiatica
      (Linn.) Lam, extracts of whole plant of Citrullus colocynthis (Linn.) Schrad, and
      Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. were assayed for their toxicity against the early
      fourth instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval
      mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. All extracts showed moderate
      larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval mortality was found in whole
      plant petroleum ether extract of C. colocynthis. In the present study,
      bioassay-guided fractionation of petroleum ether extract led to the separation
      and identification of fatty acids; oleic acid and linoleic acid were isolated and
      identified as mosquito larvicidal compounds. Oleic and Linoleic acids were quite 
      potent against fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti L. (LC50 8.80, 18.20 and
      LC90 35.39, 96.33 ppm), Anopheles stephensi Liston (LC50 9.79, 11.49 and LC90
      37.42, 47.35 ppm), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (LC50 7.66, 27.24 and LC90
      30.71, 70.38 ppm). The structure was elucidated from infrared, ultraviolet,
      1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, 13C-NMR, and mass spectral data. This is the first
      report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the reported isolated compounds
      from C. colocynthis.

AB  - Plant extracts, especially botanical insecticides, are currently studied more and
      more because of the possibility of their use in plant protection. Biological
      activity of five solvent plant extracts were studied using fourth instar larvae
      of gram pod borer Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), cotton leaf
      roller Sylepta derogata (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae). Antifeedant and larvicidal activity of acetone,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane and methanol peel, leaf and flower extracts of 
      Citrus sinensis, Ocimum canum, Ocimum sanctum and Rhinacanthus nasutus were used 
      in this study. During preliminary screening, the extracts were tested at 1,000
      ppm concentration. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All 
      extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval
      mortality was found in peel chloroform extract of C. sinensis, flower methanol
      extract of O. canum against the larvae of H. armigera (LC50 = 65.10,51.78, LC90 =
      277.39 and 218.18 ppm), peel methanol extract of C. sinensis, flower ethyl
      acetate extract of O. canum and leaf acetone extract of O. sanctum against the
      larvae of S. derogata (LC50 = 20.27,58.21,36.66, LC90 =113.15,285.70 and 668.02
      ppm), peel methanol extract of C. sinensis, leaf and flower ethyl acetate
      extracts of O. canum against the larvae of A. stephensi (LC50 =
      95.74,101.53,28.96, LC90 = 303.20,492.43 and 168.05 ppm), respectively. These
      results suggest that the chloroform and methanol extract of C. sinensis, ethyl
      acetate flower extracts of O. canum and acetone extract of O. sanctum have the
      potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the
      agricultural pests H. armigera, S. derogata and medically important vector A.
      stephensi.

TI  - Insecticidal activity of Valeriana jatamansi (Valerianaceae) against mosquitoes.
PG  - 315-8
AB  - A root extract of Valeriana jatamansi (code BAL-O) exhibited larvicidal and
      adulticidal activity against different mosquito species. The median lethal
      concentration (LC50) of BAL-O against larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles
      culicifacies, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus were
      68.1, 42.8, 51.2, 53.8, and 80.6 mg/liter, respectively. The LC50 and the 90%
      lethal concentration against adult An. stephensi, An. culicifacies, Ae. aegypti, 
      Ae. albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus were 0.14, 0.16, 0.09, 0.08, and 0.17
      and 0.24, 0.34, 0.25, 0.21, and 0.28 mg/cm2, respectively. The median knock-down 
      time and 90% knock-down time of the fraction were 13, 13, 12, 13, and 18 and 24, 
      25, 21, 20, and 42 min against An. stephensi, An. culicifacies, Ae. aegypti, An. 
      albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively, using 0.28 mg/cm2 impregnated 
      papers. The median effective time and 90% effective time against An. stephensi at
      4 degrees C were 46.6 and 8.7 days, and at 29 degrees C, 25.5 and 5.6 days,
      respectively. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of BAL-O showed
      2-butanone,4-(2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-l-yl) (10.11%), patchouli alcohol
      (8.55%), cubenol (5.97%), caryophyllene oxide (5.46%), cadinol (5.23%), and
      aristolene (5.19%).

TI  - Morphological sexual dimorphism in three species of anopheline mosquito larvae.
PG  - 308-10
AB  - Sexual separation at the larval stage in anopheline mosquitoes with the naked eye
      is difficult. We have identified distinguishing spots visible to the naked eye on
      the 6th abdominal segment of 3rd and 4th instars of Anopheles stephensi, An.
      culicifacies, and An. subpictus. Based on this feature, male and female larvae
      can be differentiated morphologically at 3rd and 4th instars of these species.
      This is the first report on these characteristic spots that may have a wide
      application for larval sexing in mosquito taxonomy, physiology, toxicology,
      genetics, and control.

TI  - Malaria persistence in Kumaon foothills of District Nainital, Uttarakhand, India.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - Clinic data depicted a high incidence of malaria in a forest ecotype in the
      Kumaon foothills of District Nainital, Uttarakhand, India. A study was therefore 
      conducted to determine the risk factors associated with the transmission of
      malaria from 2002 to 2004. The man-hour densities of Anopheles culicifacies and
      An. fluviatilis varied from 2 to 139 and 1 to 69, respectively. The sporozoite
      rate of 0.24% was recorded in An. culicifacies. Sibling species investigation
      revealed prevalence of species B (53.8%) and C (46.2%) of An. culicifacies and of
      species T (100%) of An. fluviatilis complexes. The slide positivity rate and
      slide falciparum rate were 50.4% and 28.3%, respectively. The infant parasite
      rate was 42.9% and the enlarged spleen rate among the children was 25.95%. The
      findings revealed the persistence of malaria in the area mainly due to indigenous
      transmission through the malaria vector An. culicifacies and the inadequacy of
      intervention measures. Transmission could be curtailed by indoor residual
      application of malathion.

TI  - Chikungunya fever, falciparum malaria, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis... are
      we listening to the warning signs for public health in India?
PG  - 18-23
AB  - The 2005-epidemic of Chikungunya fever highlights the weaknesses of public health
      in India. The failure to control mosquitoes, and the illnesses transmitted by
      them, has resulted in recurrent outbreaks all over the country. This is
      inevitable given the larger scenario: neglect of the basic requirements of
      health; poor political support for health; a weak public health capacity;
      centralised programmes for control based on selective interventions, and
      poorly-planned development projects which have created conditions ideal for the
      outbreak of disease. All these issues are concerns for public health ethics and
      must be addressed to tackle the problems posed by mosquito-borne as well as other
      communicable diseases.

      during the colonial era.
PG  - 564-70
LID - 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70130-0 [doi]
AB  - Malaria has a substantial secondary effect on other causes of mortality. From the
      19th century, malaria epidemics in the Andaman Islands' penal colony were
      initiated by the brackish swamp-breeding malaria vector Anopheles sundaicus and
      fuelled by the importation of new prisoners. Malaria was a major determinant of
      the highly variable all-cause mortality rate (correlation coefficient r(2)=0.60, 
      n=68, p<0.0001) from 1872 to 1939. Directly attributed malaria mortality based on
      post-mortem examinations rarely exceeded one-fifth of total mortality. Infectious
      diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, dysentery, and diarrhoea, which
      combined with malaria made up the majority of all-cause mortality, were
      positively correlated with malaria incidence over several decades. Deaths
      secondary to malaria (indirect malaria mortality) were at least as great as
      mortality directly attributed to malaria infections.

TI  - Reappraisal on anopheline mosquitoes of Garhwal region, Uttarakhand, India.
PG  - 112-23
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The study examines occurrence of anopheline mosquitoes
      in seven districts--Dehradun, Pauri, New Tehri, Hardwar, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and
      Uttarkashi of Garhwal region in Uttarakhand state, India. METHODS: The
      methodological approach comprised sampling and processing of adult/immature
      mosquitoes, data compilation, meteorological information and parasitological
      survey. RESULTS: A total of 87 localities covering 24 tehsils/blocks were
      surveyed during January 2000 to December 2005 for mosquito sampling. The study
      encountered 18 species of anophelines including three malaria vectors namely
      Anopheles culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An. stephensi collected from Kalsi,
      Dehradun City, Sahaspur, Hardwar town, Roorkee, New Tehri town and Kotdwar
      localities. An. pallidus has been recorded for the first time from the Garhwal
      region. All the collected species have been presented with particular reference
      to their both adult and immature distribution, brief account of bionomics and
      some ecological notes. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Out of 18 collected
      anopheline species, 15 were non-vectors and they were found to create nuisance to
      the inhabitants. As far as the species distribution was concerned the diversity
      was more at elevation between 150 and 1000 m above the mean sea level, while the 
      immature of some species were not recovered from those localities where their
      adults were collected. Certain species of Anopheles were climate determined and
      their distribution was localized while some others were cosmopolitan.

TI  - Metabolic pathways in Anopheles stephensi mitochondria.
PG  - 309-16
LID - 10.1042/BJ20080973 [doi]
AB  - No studies have been performed on the mitochondria of malaria vector mosquitoes. 
      This information would be valuable in understanding mosquito aging and
      detoxification of insecticides, two parameters that have a significant impact on 
      malaria parasite transmission in endemic regions. In the present study, we report
      the analyses of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria of
      cultured cells [ASE (Anopheles stephensi Mos. 43) cell line] from A. stephensi, a
      major vector of malaria in India, South-East Asia and parts of the Middle East.
      ASE cell mitochondria share many features in common with mammalian muscle
      mitochondria, despite the fact that these cells are of larval origin. However,
      two major differences with mammalian mitochondria were apparent. One, the
      glycerol-phosphate shuttle plays as major a role in NADH oxidation in ASE cell
      mitochondria as it does in insect muscle mitochondria. In contrast, mammalian
      white muscle mitochondria depend primarily on lactate dehydrogenase, whereas red 
      muscle mitochondria depend on the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle. Two, ASE
      mitochondria were able to oxidize proline at a rate comparable with that of
      alpha-glycerophosphate. However, the proline pathway appeared to differ from the 
      currently accepted pathway, in that oxoglutarate could be catabolized completely 
      by the tricarboxylic acid cycle or via transamination, depending on the ATP need.

AB  - The adverse health effect of environmental changes brought about with the
      construction of large and small dams has often been reported. Here, we present
      results of a 5-year (2001-2005) study documenting the positive effect of such
      developmental projects in reducing malaria in an area where malaria transmission 
      is mainly due to the highly efficient anthropophagic vector Anopheles fluviatilis
      with some contribution from Anopheles culicifacies. The former breeds exclusively
      in the slow-flowing streams and the latter breeds in a variety of habitats. The
      study was conducted in San Dulakudar village and comparisons were made with two
      control villages situated near the stream with similar topography and malaria
      transmission pattern. Epidemiological data was collected through longitudinal
      weekly surveillance and cross-sectional surveys in all the study villages. The
      mean annual malaria incidence rates due to Plasmodium falciparum in children of
      1-5 years age group during 2001 before construction of dam was 1304.3 and 785.7
      cases/1000 population in dam site village and control villages, respectively.
      However, after construction of dam, there was gradual reduction in the malaria
      cases in dam site village and during 2005 the incidence was significantly reduced
      to 181.8 (P<0.01) whereas it was increased to 1000 in control villages without
      any significant change in comparison to baseline year (P>0.05). A significant
      reduction in malaria incidence and parasite rate was also recorded in all the age
      groups in dam site village without registering any significant change in control 
      villages. The construction of a small dam in the study village altered the water 
      flow above and below the dam thereby making it unfavourable for the breeding of
      A. fluviatilis which in turn brought about significant impact on malaria
      transmission.

AB  - The leaf extract of Acalypha indica with different solvents viz, benzene,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol were tested for larvicidal, ovicidal
      activity and oviposition attractancy against Anopheles stephensi. The larval
      mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. The LC(50) values are 19.25, 27.76,
      23.26 and 15.03 ppm, respectively. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal
      activity was observed 120 h after treatment. The percent hatchability was
      inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional 
      to the eggs. The highest effective attractancy of 90.09%, 94.20%, 85.43% and
      95.75% were observed at 100 ppm concentration viz, benzene, chloroform, ethyl
      acetate and methanol, respectively. The lowest effective attractancy of 47.17%,
      61.94%, 49.28% and 68.12% were observed at 25 ppm concentration viz, benzene,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively. The results that the leaf
      extract of A. indica is promising as larvicidal and ovicidal activity and
      oviposition attractancy against malaria vector A. stephensi.

TI  - Association of A/T rich microsatellites with responses to artificial selection
      for larval developmental duration in the silkworm Bombyx mori.
PG  - 467-78
AB  - Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and interSSR (ISSR) marker systems were used in
      this study to reveal genetic changes induced by artificial selection for
      short/long larval duration in the tropical strain Nistari of the silkworm Bombyx 
      mori. Artificial selection separated longer larval duration (LLD) (29.428 (+/-)
      0.723 days) and shorter larval duration (SLD) (22.573 (+/-) 0.839 days) lines
      from a base, inbred population of Nistari (larval span of 23.143 (+/-) 0.35
      days). SSR polymorphism was observed between the LLD and SLD lines at one
      microsatellite locus, Bmsat106 (CA7) and at two loci of 1074 bp and 823 bp
      generated with the ISSR primer UBC873. Each of these loci was present only in the
      LLD line. The loci segregated in the third generation of selection and were fixed
      in opposite directions. In the F2 generation of the LLD x SLD lines, the alleles 
      of Bmsat106 and UBC8731074bp segregated in a 1:1 ratio and the loci were present 
      only in the LLD individuals. UBC873823bp was homozygous. Single factor ANOVA
      showed a significant association between the segregating loci and longer larval
      duration. Together, the two alleles contributed to an 18% increase in larval
      duration. The nucleotide sequences of the UBC8731074bp and UBC873823bp loci had
      67% A/T content and consisted of direct, reverse, complementary and palindromic
      repeats. The repeats appeared to be "nested" (59%) in larger repeats or as
      clustered elements adjacent to other repeats. Of 203 microsatellites identified, 
      dinucleotides (67.8%) predominated and were rich in A/T and T/A motifs. The
      sequences of the UBC8731074bp and UBC873823bp loci showed similarity (E = 0.0) to
      contigs located in Scaffold 010774 and Scaffold 000139, respectively, of the B.
      mori genome. BLASTN analysis of the UBC8731074bp sequence showed significant
      homology of (nt.) 45-122 with upstream region of three exons from Bombyx. The
      complete sequence of this locus showed approximately 49% nucleotide conservation 
      with transposon 412 of Drosophila melanogaster and the Ikirara insertions of
      Anopheles gambiae. The A + T richness and lack of coding potential of these small
      loci, and their absence in the SLD line, reflect the active process of genetic
      change associated with the switch to short larval duration as an adaptation to
      the tropics.

TI  - Determination of nitric oxide metabolites, nitrate and nitrite, in Anopheles
      culicifacies mosquito midgut and haemolymph by anion exchange high-performance
      liquid chromatography: plausible mechanism of refractoriness.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-7-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diverse physiological and pathological role of nitric oxide in
      innate immune defenses against many intra and extracellular pathogens, have led
      to the development of various methods for determining nitric oxide (NO)
      synthesis. NO metabolites, nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) are produced by the 
      action of an inducible Anopheles culicifacies NO synthase (AcNOS) in mosquito
      mid-guts and may be central to anti-parasitic arsenal of these mosquitoes.
      METHOD: While exploring a plausible mechanism of refractoriness based on nitric
      oxide synthase physiology among the sibling species of An. culicifacies, a
      sensitive, specific and cost effective high performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) method was developed, which is not influenced by the presence of biogenic 
      amines, for the determination of NO2- and NO3- from mosquito mid-guts and
      haemolymph. RESULTS: This method is based on extraction, efficiency, assay
      reproducibility and contaminant minimization. It entails de-proteinization by
      centrifugal ultra filtration through ultracel 3 K filter and analysis by high
      performance anion exchange liquid chromatography (Sphereclone, 5 mu SAX column)
      with UV detection at 214 nm. The lower detection limit of the assay procedure is 
      50 pmoles in all midgut and haemolymph samples. Retention times for NO2- and NO3-
      in standards and in mid-gut samples were 3.42 and 4.53 min. respectively. Assay
      linearity for standards ranged between 50 nM and 1 mM. Recoveries of NO2- and
      NO3- from spiked samples (1-100 muM) and from the extracted standards (1-100 muM)
      were calculated to be 100%. Intra-assay and inter assay variations and relative
      standard deviations (RSDs) for NO2- and NO3- in spiked and un-spiked midgut
      samples were 5.7% or less. Increased levels NO2- and NO3- in midguts and
      haemolymph of An. culicifacies sibling species B in comparison to species A
      reflect towards a mechanism of refractoriness based on AcNOS physiology.
      CONCLUSION: HPLC is a sensitive and accurate technique for identification and
      quantifying pmole levels of NO metabolites in mosquito midguts and haemolymph
      samples that can be useful for clinical investigations of NO biochemistry,
      physiology and pharmacology in various biological samples.

PG  - 6-10
AB  - Mosquito species occurring in Bellary district, Karnataka, India were surveyed
      for Japanese encephalitis (JE) and West Nile virus (WNV) from 2001 to 2003. A
      total of 37 mosquito species in 6 genera were recovered from larval and adult
      habitats. Aedes, Anopheles and Culex were represented by 11 species each,
      Mansonia by 2 species, and Armigeres and Lutzia by a single species. A total of
      68,506 mosquitoes belonging to 20 species were collected at dusk. Most (74.6%)
      were Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and occurred in 2 peaks of abundance in February (304 
      per man hour density [PMHD]) and October (465 PMHD). The mosquito fauna of
      Bellary district is not diverse, possibly because of the hot and dry climatic
      conditions in the area.

TI  - Mosquito larvicidal activity of gluanol acetate, a tetracyclic triterpenes
      derived from Ficus racemosa Linn.
PG  - 333-9
LID - 10.1007/s00436-008-0976-6 [doi]
AB  - The larvicidal activity of crude hexane, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, acetone,
      and methanol extracts of the leaf and bark of Ficus racemosa (Moraceae) was
      assayed for their toxicity against the early fourth-instar larvae of Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was observed after
      24-h exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the
      highest larval mortality was found in bark acetone extract of F. racemosa. In the
      present study, bioassay-guided fractionation of acetone extract led to the
      separation and identification of a tetracyclic triterpenes derivative; gluanol
      acetate was isolated and identified as new mosquito larvicidal compound. Gluanol 
      acetate was quite potent against fourth-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti L. (LC(50)
      14.55 and LC(90) 64.99 ppm), Anopheles stephensi Liston (LC(50) 28.50 and LC(90) 
      106.50 ppm) and C. quinquefasciatus Say (LC(50) 41.42 and LC(90) 192.77 ppm). The
      structure was elucidated from infrared, ultraviolet, (1)H-nuclear magnetic
      resonance (NMR), (13)C-NMR, and mass spectral data. This is the first report on
      the mosquito larvicidal activity of the reported compound from F. racemosa.

TI  - Relative susceptibility of some common mosquito vector larvae to synthetic
      insecticidal compounds in north-western Rajasthan.
PG  - 829-32
AB  - Relative susceptibility of three important mosquito vector larvae viz., Anopheles
      stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, prevalent in the arid region
      was determined against four organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion, fenthion, 
      temephos) and three synthetic pyrethroid (alphamethrin, deltamethrin and
      fanvalerate) compounds. Studies were carried out on late 3rd or early 4th instar 
      larvae of these species using standard WHO technique. Based on concentration
      mortality data LC50 and LC90 values along with their fiducial limits, regression 
      equation, chi-square (chi2)/heterogeneity of the response have been determined by
      log probit regression analysis. LC50 values as observed for the above seven
      insecticides were 0.8097, 0.0398. 0.0432, 0.0035, 0.0025, 0.0092, 0.1006; 1.2370,
      0.0531, 0.0655, 0.0076, 0.00004, 0.00004, 0.0046 and 1.4980, 0.0719, 0.0817,
      0.0056, 0.00021, 0.00073, 0.0112 mg/l for the above three mosquito species
      respectively Among the four organophosphates tested temephos was the most
      effective followed by fenitrothion, fenthion and malathion. In general, Anopheles
      was found more susceptible as compared to the other two culicines to the above
      four compounds. The results also showed that larvae of Ae. aegypti were most
      susceptible followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. stephensi to all the three
      pyrethroids tested. Among the three compounds tested alphamethrin was found to be
      the most toxic followed by deltamethrin while fanvalerate was the least toxic.
      The study would be of great importance while planning use of these insecticides
      for the control of different vector species in this area.

TI  - Identification of Anopheles fauna in a hyperendemic falciparum area of Orissa
      State, India.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Keonjhar district of Orissa State has been hyperendemic
      for falciparum malaria since many years with alarming deaths due to cerebral
      malaria. Therefore an entomological investigation to know more about the relative
      prevalence of Anopheles species was done. METHODS: Daytime indoor resting and
      outdoor resting, light trap and double bed net collections were made. Surveys
      were also made to collect Anopheles immature in streams and paddy fields. The
      Anopheles mosquitoes obtained by different catching methods were identified and
      the known vector species were subjected to gut and salivary gland dissection for 
      vector incrimination. The infected specimens of An. fluviatilis and An. minimus
      were subjected to polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of sibling
      species. RESULTS: Of the anophelines collected, the most abundant was An.
      splendidus (18.2%) and An. fluviatilis (17.7%), followed by An. maculatus (14.0%)
      and An. minimus (9.0%). The sporozoite rate of An. fluviatilis and An. minimus
      was 0.9 and 1.4 respectively. The infected specimens have been identified as
      sibling species S of the An. fluviatilis complex and A of the An. minimus
      complex. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: An. fluviatilis and An. minimus are the
      major two species in the transmission of malaria in Keonjhar district in Orissa.

TI  - Mosquitocidal and repellent activity of the leaf extract of Citrullus vulgaris
      (cucurbitaceae) against the malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi liston (diptera 
      culicidae).
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The efficacy of the Cucurbitaceous plant Citrullus vulgaris against the Anopheles
      stephensi was assessed in the present study. The leaf extract of Citrullus
      vulgaris with different solvents viz, benzene, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and
      methanol were tested for larvicidial, ovicidal, repellent and insect growth
      regulatory activities against Anopheles stephensi. The larval mortality was
      observed after 24 h exposure. The LC50 values are 18.56, 48.51, 49.57 and 50.32
      ppm respectively. The mean percent hatchability of the egg of Anopheles stephensi
      were observed after 48 h. 100 per cent mortality was exerted at 250 ppm with
      benzene extract and the other extracts exerted 100 percent mortality at 300 ppm. 
      Skin repellent test at 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg per cm2 concentration gave the mean
      complete protection time ranged from 119.17 to 387.83 minutes with the four
      different extracts tested. The Citrullus vulgaris plant extract have shown insect
      growth regulatory activity against Anopheles stephensi at five different test
      concentrations ranging from 10 to 150 ppm with different solvents and they
      exhibit the following EI50 values 28.99, 70.02, 106.33 and 84.25 ppm
      respectively.

TI  - Insecticide treated mosquito nets for malaria control in India-experience from a 
      tribal area on operational feasibility and uptake.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - The study assessed the operational feasibility and acceptability of
      insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) in one Primary Health Centre (PHC) in a 
      falciparum malaria endemic district in the state of Orissa, India, where 74% of
      the people are tribes and DDT indoor residual spraying had been withdrawn and
      ITNs introduced by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. To a
      population of 63,920, 24,442 ITNs were distributed free of charge through 101
      treatment centers during July-August 2002. Interview of 1,130, 1,012 and 126
      respondents showed that the net use rates were 80%, 74% and 55% in the cold,
      rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Since using ITNs, 74.5-76.6% of the
      respondents observed reduction of mosquito bites and 7.2-32.1% reduction of
      malaria incidence; 37% expressed willingness to buy ITNs if the cost was lower
      and they were affordable. Up to ten months post-treatment, almost 100% mortality 
      of vector mosquitoes was recorded on unwashed and washed nets (once or twice).
      Health workers re-treated the nets at the treatment centers eight months after
      distribution on a cost-recovery basis. The coverage reported by the PHC was only 
      4.2%, mainly because of unwillingness of the people to pay for re-treatment and
      to go to the treatment centers from their villages. When the re-treatment was
      continued at the villages involving personnel from several departments, the
      coverage improved to about 90%. Interview of 126 respondents showed that among
      those who got their nets re-treated, 81.4% paid cash for the re-treatment and the
      remainder were reluctant to pay. Majority of those who paid said that they did so
      due to the fear that if they did not do so they would lose benefits from other
      government welfare schemes. The 2nd re-treatment was therefore carried out free
      of charge nine months after the 1st re-treatment and thus achieved coverage of
      70.4%. The study showed community acceptance to use ITNs as they perceived the
      benefit. Distribution and re-treatment of nets was thus possible through the PHC 
      system, if done free of charge and when personnel from different departments,
      especially those at village level, were involved.

TI  - In Silico analysis of voltage-gated sodium channel in relation to DDT resistance 
      in vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 413-21
AB  - The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is the target site for insecticides such 
      as DDT and synthetic pyrethroids. A single base (A-T) change in the knock-down
      resistance (kdr) allele leads to an amino acid substitution at position 267 that 
      confers the target-mediated resistance to DDT and synthetic pyrethroids in
      Anopheles gambiae. A theoretical model of the VGSC domain II that contains the
      site of mutation was constructed using the K;+ channel protein of Aeropyrum
      pernix as a template. The validated model with 88.6% residues in the favored
      region was subjected to the CASTp program that predicted 30 pockets in the
      modeled domain II for ligand interaction. In the model, at position 267, leucine 
      was manually replaced with phenylalanine. When this altered model was subjected
      to the CASTp program, the search results showed the same number of pockets. The
      docking results indicate that DDT interacts with the modeled VGSC domain II at
      position 275 in the presence of leucine or in the presence of phenylalanine
      (binding energy =-5.32 kcal/mol, -6.21 kcal/mol). It appears from the results
      that the mutation at position 267 has no direct influence on the interaction of
      DDT with the target protein. Therefore, to understand the interaction affinity of
      DDT with the target and influence of the mutation on the existence of active
      sites/pockets in relation to ligand binding, a whole VGSC model is necessary.

AB  - Anopheles (Cellia) stephensi Liston 1901 is one of the major malaria vectors in
      the Indian subcontinent, Iran, and the Middle East. Three races in this species, 
      namely A. stephensi stephensi (type form), A. stephensi variety mysorensis, and
      A. stephensi intermediate form, have earlier been reported by several
      investigators. We describe here the sequencing of the ribosomal DNA internal
      transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and domain-3 (D3) loci of the A. stephensi type and
      variety mysorensis forms. We also sequenced field-collected adult specimens of
      this mosquito from three different regions of India. Both forms of A. stephensi
      showed identical ITS2 and D3 sequences. We did not find any intraspecies sequence
      variation among the 70 specimens sequenced in this study. In contrast to the
      eight ITS2 haplotypes observed among Iranian A. stephensi population, we found
      only one ITS2 haplotype in India. This is the first time to our knowledge that
      the sequence of the D3 locus of A. stephensi is being reported here. In
      conclusion, the type and variety mysorensis forms of A. stephensi exhibit
      identical nucleotide sequences at their ITS2 and D3 loci.

AB  - Manipulating the endogenous immune responses of the mosquito such as temporal and
      spatial expression of antimicrobial peptides may help in the development of a
      refractory mosquito, unable to transmit malaria. In mosquito several small
      antimicrobial peptides are activated locally in the midgut and salivary glands
      upon Plasmodium infection. Anopheles stephensi, the major urban malaria vector in
      India, has been considered as an important insect model to study vector-parasite 
      interactions; however, so far no reports are available on the antimicrobial
      peptides from this mosquito species. In the present study, we report
      identification and molecular characterization of a novel cDNA encoding defensin
      like peptide, isolated from the salivary gland subtractive hybridization cDNA
      library of mosquito A. stephensi. Defensin cDNA is 396 base pair long, bearing an
      open reading frame of 96 amino acids. Deduced amino acid sequence of A. stephensi
      defensin (Astp_def) contains a signal peptide sequence of 24 amino acids followed
      by 32-amino acids long putative propeptide domain and a 40-amino acid mature
      peptide domain carrying 23-amino acid long consensuses sequence signature of
      insect defensin. Mature peptide of Astp_def carries six conserved cysteine
      residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 4.20kDa, and isoelectric point of 
      8.30, characteristic features of cationic defensins. Amino acid sequence
      similarity and phylogenetic analysis indicated a higher variation in the
      pre-propeptide region, as compared to the mature defensin peptide, assuring the
      presence of finely tuned immune responses to counter pathogens.

TI  - Burden of malaria in India: retrospective and prospective view.
PG  - 69-78
AB  - In India, nine Anopheline vectors are involved in transmitting malaria in diverse
      geo-ecological paradigms. About 2 million confirmed malaria cases and 1,000
      deaths are reported annually, although 15 million cases and 20,000 deaths are
      estimated by WHO South East Asia Regional Office. India contributes 77% of the
      total malaria in Southeast Asia. Multi-organ involvement/dysfunction is reported 
      in both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax cases. Most of the malaria burden is
      borne by economically productive ages. The states inhabited by ethnic tribes are 
      entrenched with stable malaria, particularly P. falciparum with growing drug
      resistance. The profound impact of complicated malaria in pregnancy includes
      anemia, abortions, low birth weight in neonates, still births, and maternal
      mortality. Retrospective analysis of burden of malaria showed that disability
      adjusted life years lost due to malaria were 1.86 million years. Cost-benefit
      analysis suggests that each Rupee invested by the National Malaria Control
      Program pays a rich dividend of 19.7 Rupees.

TI  - Repellent activity of selected plant essential oils against the malarial fever
      mosquito Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - In recent years, use of environment friendly and biodegradable natural
      insecticides of plant origin have received renewed attention as agents for vector
      control. In this study, essential oils extracted by steam distillation from
      leaves of five plant species Centella asiatica L., Ipomoea cairica L., Momordica 
      charantia L., Psidium guajava L. and Tridax procumbens L. were evaluated for
      their topical repellency effects against malarial vector Anopheles stephensi in
      mosquito cages. All essential oils were tested at three different concentrations 
      (2, 4 and 6%). Of these, the essential oils of I. cairica, M. charantia and T.
      procumbens exhibited relatively high repellency effect (>300 minutes at 6%
      concentration), followed by C. asiatica and P. guajava which showed less
      effective (< 150 minutes at 6 % concentration). However, the ethanol applied arm 
      served as control provided maximum 8.0 minutes repellency in this study. In
      general, clear dose-response relationships were established in all essential
      oils, with the highest concentration of 6% provided high repellency effect. The
      results obtained from this study suggest that essential oils of I. cairica, M.
      charantia and T. procumbens are promising as repellents at 6% concentration
      against An. stephensi and could be useful in the search for new natural repellent
      compounds.

AB  - The benzene extract of Citrullus vulgaris was tested against Anopheles stephensi 
      and Aedes aegypti for the larvicidal activity and ovicidal properties. The crude 
      benzene extract was found to be more effective against A. stephensi than A.
      aegypti. The LC50 values were 18.56 and 42.76 ppm respectively. The LC50 values
      for silica gel fractions (bioactive fractions I, II, III and IV) were 11.32,
      14.12, 14.53 and 16.02 ppm respectively. The mean per cent hatchability of the
      egg rafts were observed after 48 h post treatment. The crude extract of benzene
      exerted 100% mortality at 250 ppm against A. stephensi and at 300 ppm against A. 
      aegypti. The silica gel fractions I and II afforded 100% mortality at 100 ppm and
      III and IV exerted the hatchability rate of 4.9 and 5.3% at the same
      concentration against A. stephensi.

LID - 10.1007/s00436-007-0864-5 [doi]
AB  - Larvicidal activity of crude hexane, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, acetone and 
      methanol extracts of five medicinal plants, Abutilon indicum, Aegle marmelos,
      Euphorbia thymifolia, Jatropha gossypifolia and Solanum torvum were assayed for
      their toxicity against the early fourth-instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus. 
      The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. All extracts showed
      moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval mortality was found in
      petroleum ether extract of A. indicum. In the present study, bioassay-guided
      fractionation of A. indicum led to the separation and identification of a
      beta-sitosterol as a potential new mosquito larvicidal compound with LC50 value
      of 11.49, 3.58 and 26.67 ppm against Aedes aegypti L, Anopheles stephensi Liston 
      and C. quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), respectively. 1H NMR, 13C NMR
      and mass spectral data confirmed the identification of the active compound.
      beta-sitosterol has been recognized as the active ingredient of many medicinal
      plant extracts. All the crude extracts when screened for their larvicidal
      activities indicated toxicity against the larvae of C. quinquefasciatus. This
      article reports the isolation and identification of the beta-sitosterol as well
      as bioassay data for the crude extracts. There are no reports of beta-sitosterol 
      in the genus A. indicum, and their larvicidal activities are being evaluated for 
      the first time. Results of this study show that the petroleum ether extract of A.
      indicum may be considered as a potent source and beta-sitosterol as a new natural
      mosquito larvicidal agent.

TI  - Wash resistance of PermaNets in comparison to hand-treated nets.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - The wash resistance of factory produced PermaNets (with deltamethrin bonded to
      the netting with a resin) was studied by bioassays with Anopheles stephensi.
      Commercial detergent powders were used to wash the nets. For comparison,
      conventionally treated nets were washed and bio-assayed. Nets were washed under
      laboratory conditions using a Rotary shaker for 10min. Mosquito bioassays used
      standard WHO plastic cones with an exposure time of 3min. The PermaNet caused
      almost a 100% mortality of An. stephensi after up to 18 washes and >80% mortality
      up to 26 washes but after 30 washes mortality declined. The differences between
      the mortality of An. stephensi on treated nets washed with detergent or soap
      (uncoloured, non-perfumed) were not significant. When conventional nets dipped in
      deltamethrin (25mg/m(2)) or lambdacyhalothrin (10mg/m(2)) were washed under
      similar laboratory conditions, the wash resistance was markedly less than that of
      the PermaNet. In the case of deltamethrin, mosquito mortality remained >80% up to
      12 washes and with lambdacyhalothrin mortality remained above 80% up to 11
      washes. The relationship of 80% mortality from a 3min bioassay to effectiveness
      against free flying mosquitoes remains to be determined.

AB  - Malaria is most common infectious disease spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes
      especially in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It is reported by WHO 
      as a 4th leading cause of death in children across the developing countries.
      Unfortunately no vaccine is currently available. Sickle cell trait (HbAS)
      patients provide some resistance for malaria over normal persons (HbAA) or their 
      homozygous state (HbSS) due to various reasons.

TI  - Larvicidal and ovicidal activity of Cassia fistula Linn. leaf extract against
      filarial and malarial vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 289-92
AB  - Methanolic leaf extract of Cassia fistula was tested for larvicidal and ovicidal 
      activity against Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi. The extract was 
      found to be more lethal to the larvae of A. stephensi than C. quinquefasciatus
      with LC(50) values of 17.97 and 20.57 mg/l, respectively. Mean percent
      hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 120 h after treatment. The
      percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract
      and directly proportional to the eggs. The egg raft of C. quinquefasciatus was
      found to be more hatchable than A. stephensi. The results show that the leaf
      extract of C. fistula is promising as a larvicidal and ovicidal agent against C. 
      quinquefasciatus and A. stephensi.

TI  - Strong larvicidal activity of three species of Spilanthes (Akarkara) against
      malaria (Anopheles stephensi Liston, Anopheles culicifacies, species C) and
      filaria vector (Culex quinquefasciatus Say).
PG  - 171-4
AB  - A system for biocontrol of malaria and filarial mosquito vectors has been
      developed using herbal extracts of three Spilanthes species, S. acmella L.var
      oleraceae Clarke, S. calva L. and S. paniculata Wall ex DC. Cent percent
      mortalities was achieved against the late third/early fourth instar larvae of A. 
      stephensi Liston, A. culicifacies species C and C. quinquefasciatus Say using
      crude hexane extract obtained from flower heads of Spilanthes spp. Of the three
      plant species, S. acmella extract proved to be the most effective in inducing
      complete lethality at minimum doses, the respective LC50 and LC90 values being
      4.57 and 7.83 (A. stephensi), 0.87 and 1.92 (A. culicifacies) and 3.11 and 8.89
      ppm (C. quinquefasciatus). This was followed by S. calva and S. paniculata
      extracts, respectively. This is the first report of achieving cent percent
      lethality against these mosquito larvae using minimal doses of plant extracts
      from this or any other plant species.

TI  - Molecular genetic studies of Anopheles stephensi in Pakistan.
PG  - 265-9
AB  - Anopheles stephensi Liston s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the major vectors 
      of malaria in Pakistan, India, Iran and Afghanistan. In parts of its range this
      species has shown increases in both relative and absolute abundance in what is
      hypothesized to be a response to human-mediated environmental change resulting
      from extensive irrigation. We attempted to detect the molecular genetic
      signatures of this population instability based on three samples obtained from
      two villages (149/6R and 111/6R) within an irrigation zone in Punjab Province and
      from one village (Azakhel) outside the irrigation scheme in Northwest Frontier
      Province (NWFP), Pakistan, using seven microsatellite loci and 682 basepairs of
      the mitochondrial CO1 gene. For microsatellite loci, high levels of genetic
      diversity were observed within populations (mean alleles per locus 10.71-11.57;
      mean heterozygosity 0.703-0.733). Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations was 
      observed for only two microsatellite loci in 21 tests. No genetic differentiation
      was observed between populations and average pairwise F(ST) values did not differ
      significantly from zero for any population pair or either marker system. Tests of
      population expansion for both mitochondrial and microsatellite loci were
      inconclusive.

TI  - Malaria situation in forest-fringed villages of Sonitpur district (Assam), India 
      bordering Arunachal Pradesh during an outbreak.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological and entomological studies were
      undertaken in forest-fringed villages in Sonitpur district (Assam) bordering
      Arunachal Pradesh, India to assess the malaria situation. Blood smears (thick and
      thin) were collected from the fever cases through door-to-door survey. Both the
      blood smears stained with Giemsa were used for malaria parasite detection. Slide 
      positivity rate (SPR) was recorded as 39.1% with predominance of Plasmodium
      falciparum (97.1%) infections. Children between 5 and 14 yr showed higher rates
      of infection. METHODS & RESULTS: Over all malaria prevalence was higher among the
      males (SPR 43.2%) than in females (SPR 34.5%). Adult mosquito collection was made
      using CDC miniature light-traps from dusk-to-dawn. Per-trap night density of
      mosquitoes in human dwellings and cattlesheds were 289 and 925, respectively.
      Anopheles minimus and An. dirus, the major vectors of malaria in Northeastern
      region of India formed 33.2% of the total vectors recorded. An. dirus could be
      recorded only from human dwellings. The results showed high malaria risk in the
      study villages. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: High vector density with high parity
      rate, poor socio-economic conditions, lack of awareness, poor sanitation and
      congenial atmosphere for mosquito proliferation are aggravating the malaria
      situation in the study area.

TI  - Chemical composition and larvicidal activities of the essential oil of
      Zanthoxylum armatum DC (Rutaceae) against three mosquito vectors.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In view of the recently increased interest in developing
      plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticide, this study
      was undertaken to assess the larvicidal potential of the essential oil from the
      seeds of Zanthoxylum armatum DC [syn. Z. alatum Roxb] (Rutaceae) against three
      medically important species of mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. METHODS: Essential oil was hydro distilled 
      in the laboratory from the seeds obtained from the market and the chemical
      constituents of the oil were determined using GC/GC-MS. Bioefficacy of the
      essential oil was evaluated under laboratory conditions using III instar mosquito
      larvae. RESULTS: Among the three mosquito species tested, Cx. quinquefasciatus
      was the most sensitive (LC50 = 49 ppm) followed by Ae. aegypti (LC50 = 54 ppm)
      and An. stephensi (LC50 = 58 ppm). GC-MS analysis of the oil revealed at least 28
      compounds, consisting mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (75%) and monoterpenes
      (22%). Linalool though constituted a major part (57%), failed to produce any
      appreciable mortality when tested alone. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: From the
      results it can be concluded that the larvae of the three mosquito species were
      susceptible to the essential oil composition. Such findings would be useful in
      promoting research aiming at the development of new agent for mosquito control
      based on bioactive chemical compounds from indigenous plant sources as an
      alternative to chemical larvicides.

PG  - 106-11
AB  - Secondary metabolites from Dysoxylum malabaricum and Dysoxylum beddomei were
      tested against mature and immature stage of the mosquito vector Anopheles
      stephensi under laboratory conditions. The triterpenes
      3beta,24,25-trihydroxycycloartane and beddomeilactone from D. malabaricum and D. 
      beddomei showed strong larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity. They also 
      affected the reproductive potential of adults by acting as oviposition
      deterrents. The highest concentration tested (10 ppm) of both compounds evoked
      more than 90% mortality and oviposition deterrence.

TI  - Efficacy of PermaNet 2.0 against Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi, 
      malaria vectors in India.
PG  - 220-3
AB  - Bioefficacy of PermaNet was evaluated in both the laboratory and field against
      Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi, major malaria vectors in India. Contact
      bioassays were carried out after repeated washings and ring net bioassays to
      determine the median knockdown time of mosquitoes. Three villages were selected
      for the field trial: in the 1st village PermaNets were distributed, in the 2nd
      village untreated nets were distributed, and the 3rd village was a control.
      Entomological data were collected using standard procedures. The PermaNet contact
      bioassays showed high mortality (>80%) even after 20 washes against both the
      vector species. The median knockdown time of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi
      was 392 and 480 sec when exposed to fresh PermaNets and 472 and 986 sec when
      exposed to PermaNets that had been washed 20 times, respectively. PermaNets
      showed high efficacy in reducing the person-vector contact as evidenced by
      reduced person-hour density in the PermaNet village. Long-term field trials are
      indicated to test the impact of use of PermaNets in controlling malaria.

AB  - The use of larvivorous fish in malaria control is not new but a half-forgotten
      strategy. It has been shown to be effective and sustainable in many
      circumstances. A strategic action plan targeting relevant sibling species of the 
      vectors as well as application of global positioning system technology to
      facilitate rapid re-checking of sites for the continuing presence of fish are
      important new features of this strategy.

TI  - Impact of Olyset nets on malaria transmission in India.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Efficacy of Olyset nets, long-lasting insecticidal nets 
      were tested from August 2003 to August 2006 against Anopheles culicifacies, the
      vector which transmits 60% of all malaria cases in rural India. METHODS: Three
      villages in District Gautam Budh Nagar (Uttar Pradesh), India were selected for
      the trial and Olyset nets were distributed in one village, in another village
      untreated nets were distributed and the third village was kept as control where
      nets were not used. Entomological, and epidemiological data were collected using 
      standard methods. RESULTS: The use of Olyset nets reduced the indoor resting
      density of An. culicifacies and also reduced mosquito entry into the structures
      where Olyset nets were used. No mosquitoes were caught landing on the Olyset
      nets. There was a reduction in the parity rate of An. culicifacies in the Olyset 
      net village as compared with untreated net and no net villages. The impact of
      Olyset nets was observed on malaria incidence and only one case of
      Plasmodiumfalciparum malaria was reported in the Olyset net village but these
      continued to be found in the village with untreated nets and the control.
      CONCLUSION: Results of the present study confirmed that Olyset nets are highly
      effective in reducing the indoor resting density of mosquitoes, man-vector
      contact and malaria incidence.

TI  - rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay for grouping the cryptic species of Anopheles culicifacies
      complex (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 72-7
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies, a predominant vector of malaria in India exists as a
      complex of five sibling species A, B, C, D and E, of which, except species B, all
      the rest are vectors with varying vectorial capacities. With a combination of PCR
      assays, it is possible to identify all the five members of this species complex. 
      These assays include amplification of the rDNA-ITS2 region followed by digestion 
      of the ITS2 amplicon using restriction enzyme, Rsa I which groups the five
      members of the An. culicifacies complex into two categories: species A and D
      forming one category and species B, C and E forming another. The samples grouped 
      thus are then subjected to two allele-specific PCR assays (AD-PCR and BCE-PCR),
      which has been designed using sequence differences in the mitochondrial
      cytochrome oxidase II (CO II) subunit. The AD-PCR assay distinguishes species A
      and D, whereas the BCE-PCR assay distinguishes species B, C and E. In the present
      study, the differences in the ITS2 region of the five species was used to design 
      a PCR assay which groups the five members into the same two categories as
      obtained after digestion of the ITS2-PCR product. This assay uses a common
      forward primer based on the 5.8S region and two reverse primers, which is
      specific for the two categories. Amplification of a PCR product of size 253bp
      indicates the presence of species A/D, while a product of size 409bp indicates
      the presence of species B/C/E. By using this ITS2 PCR assay, the three-step
      procedure is reduced to two cutting down the time and cost involved. The ITS2 PCR
      assay has been validated on specimens collected from different regions of India
      and the results confirm to the earlier reports on the distribution of the members
      of the An. culicifacies complex.

TI  - Prediction of 3-dimensional structure of salivary odorant-binding protein-2 of
      the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, the vector of human lymphatic filariasis.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Olfaction of insects is currently recognized as the major area of research for
      developing novel control strategies to prevent mosquito-borne infections. A
      3-dimensional model (3D) was developed for the salivary gland odorant-binding
      protein-2 of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, a major vector of human
      lymphatic filariasis. A homology modeling method was used for the prediction of
      the structure. For the modeling, two template proteins were obtained by
      mGenTHERADER, namely the high-resolution X-ray crystallography structure of a
      pheromone-binding protein (ASP1) of Apis mellifera L., [1R5R:A] and the
      aristolochene synthase from Penicillium roqueforti [1DI1:B]. By comparing the
      template protein a rough model was constructed for the target protein using
      MODELLER, a program for comparative modelling. The structure of OBP of the
      mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus resembles the structure of pheromone-binding
      protein ASP1 of Apis mellifera L., [1R5R:A]. From Ramachandran plot analysis it
      was found that the portion of residues falling into the most favoured regions was
      86.0%. The predicted 3-D model may be further used in characterizing the protein 
      in wet laboratory.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of Solanum xanthocarpum extracts alone and in combination
      with a synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, against malaria vector, Anopheles
      stephensi.
PG  - 256-60
AB  - With a goal of minimal application of environmentally hazardous chemical
      insecticides, the larvicidal activity of cypermethrin was studied alone and in
      combination with the root extract of Solanum xanthocarpum against anopheline
      larvae. Petroleum ether extract was observed to be the most toxic, with LC,, of
      1.41 and 0.93 ppm and LC90 of 16.94 and 8.48 ppm at 24 and 48 hours after
      application, respectively, followed by carbon tetrachloride and methanol
      extracts. The values for cypermethrin were an LC50 of 0.0369 ppm after 24 hours
      and 0.0096 ppm after 48 hours and LC90 of 0.0142 and 0.0091 ppm after 24 and 48
      hours, respectively. The ratios of cypermethrin and petroleum ether extracts
      tested were 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4. Of the various ratios tested, the cypermethrin and 
      petroleum ether extract ratio of 1:1 was observed to be more efficient than the
      other combinations. From the individual efficacy of each constituent, synergism
      was noted. This is an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of malaria
      vector, Anopheles stephensi.

TI  - Evaluation of mosquitocidal activity of essential oil and sesquiterpenes from
      leaves of Chloroxylon swietenia DC.
PG  - 413-8
AB  - Growing awareness in using ecofriendly and biologically compatible
      phytoconstituents as natural insecticides and repellents for the safety of life
      and ecological balance led to conscientious efforts by scientists all over the
      world to search for alternative sources of plant derivatives for effective use as
      mosquitocides. Encouraged by this, the essential oil and the sesquiterpenes
      isolated from the leaves of Chloroxylon swietenia DC. were screened for
      mosquitocidal activity by fumigant toxicity against three mosquito species,
      Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. The essential oil
      had pronounced mosquitocidal activity with LD50 of 1.0, 1.2 and 1.7 x 10(-3)
      mg/cm(-3), respectively, for the three vector species. Furthermore, the major
      sesquiterpenes were tested at different doses, which again showed varying levels 
      of toxicity. However, germacrene D performed better and proved to be the
      potential candidate with LD50 values of 1.8-2.8 x 10(-3) mg/cm(-3) followed by
      pregeijerene and geijerene. Nevertheless, the oil and the isolated compounds were
      particularly active against A. gambiae. The essential oil from the leaves was
      obtained by hydrodistillation, and the chemical composition was determined by GC 
      and GC-MS. The main compounds identified were limonene, germacrene D, geijerene, 
      pregeijerene, trans-beta-ocimene and methyl eugenol. The present study indicates 
      that the oil and the isolated compounds of C. swietenia displayed remarkable
      mosquitocidal activity suggesting that the method could be extended for future
      field trials in various mosquito control programmes, and the results are compared
      with synthetic insecticides.

TI  - Transcriptional analysis of an immune-responsive serine protease from Indian
      malarial vector, Anopheles culicifacies.
PG  - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main vector for transmission of malaria in India is the Anopheles
      culicifacies mosquito species, a naturally selected subgroup of which is
      completely refractory (R) to transmission of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium
      vivax; RESULTS: Here, we report the molecular characterization of a serine
      protease (acsp30)-encoding gene from A. culicifacies, which was expressed in high
      abundance in the refractory strain compared to the susceptible (S) strain. The
      transcriptional upregulation of acsp30 upon Plasmodium challenge in the
      refractory strain coincided with ookinete invasion of mosquito midgut. Gene
      organization and primary sequence of acsp30 were identical in the R and S strains
      suggesting a divergent regulatory status of acsp30 in these strains. To examine
      this further, the upstream regulatory sequences of acsp30 were isolated, cloned
      and evaluated for the presence of promoter activity. The 702 bp upstream region
      of acsp30 from the two strains revealed sequence divergence. The promoter
      activity measured by luciferase-based reporter assay was shown to be 1.5-fold
      higher in the R strain than in the S. Gel shift experiments demonstrated a
      differential recruitment of nuclear proteins to upstream sequences of acsp30 as
      well as a difference in the composition of nuclear proteins in the two strains,
      both of which might contribute to the relative abundance of acsp30 in the R
      strain; CONCLUSION: The specific upregulation of acsp30 in the R strain only in
      response to Plasmodium infection is suggestive of its role in contributing the
      refractory phenotype to the A. culicifacies mosquito population.

      unique mosquito processing method.
PG  - 837-43
AB  - A multiplex PCR assay has been developed for detection of Anopheles fluviatilis
      cryptic species, their human host preference, and Plasmodium falciparum presence 
      in the mosquito. PCR conditions were optimized using primer sets specific for A. 
      fluviatilis cryptic species, Homo sapiens, and P. falciparum and evaluated with
      field-collected mosquitoes. A unique mosquito processing method was used for
      screening P. falciparum carrying capacity and human host preference of A.
      fluviatilis mosquitoes in first-round multiplex PCR. The vectorial status of the 
      mosquito for P. falciparum parasite was confirmed in second-round PCR. Of the 121
      collected mosquitoes, 92 were of S type, 26 of T type, and 3 were of other types.
      Human host preference was dominant in S type, of which 4% were P. falciparum
      sporozoite positive. This assay and processing method can also be used to
      evaluate vector competence of other anophelines.

AB  - Thirty four species of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were collected across
      three phytogeographic zones; tropical (300 to 1000 m), sub tropical (1000 to 2000
      m) and temperate (2000 to 3000 m) in the Garhwal region of India. They included 5
      genera: Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Uranotaenia. Of these, the
      immature forms of 23 species were recovered from different breeding habitats. The
      larval habitats were seepage pools, river beds, rice fields, tanks, forest pools,
      ditches, streams, rock holes, tree holes, intradomestic containers and shallow
      pits. Three groups and two separate individual species were associated, based on 
      breeding habitat similarity by means of cluster analysis. The characters taken
      into consideration for classification were natural/artificial,
      temporary/permanent, shady/lighted, vegetation, movement and turbidity. Breeding 
      habitats such as streams and rock holes were the richest habitats shared by 18
      mosquito species followed by seepage pools harboring 16 species of mosquitoes.
      The lowest species diversity (6 species) was recorded from shallow pits.
      Generally, all the collected species were found in natural habitats in
      quiet/stagnant conditions at a depth of 0.1-0.5 m. Generally, the maximum number 
      of species preferred partially shady and temporary water habitats. Moderate
      vegetation and clear water habitats also had a diversity of mosquito species.
      Culex mimeticus Noe and Anopheles maculatus Theobald had the highest association 
      coefficient (0.941) followed by Anopheles stephensi Liston and Anopheles vagus
      Donitz (0.884). The highest negative association (-0.30) was found between the
      species of Culex vishnui Theobald and Culex brevipalpis (Giles). There were a few
      species of mosquitoes for which only immatures were collected.
      Phytogeographically, the zones of lower elevation shared higher species abundance
      than the higher elevation.

TI  - Eco-friendly control of mosquito larvae by Brachytron pratense nymph.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - The study reported here revealed the biocontrol efficacy of aquatic nymphs of the
      dragonfly Brachytron pratense against larvae of the mosquito Anopheles subpictus.
      It was found that during a 24-hour study period, a nymph of B. pratense would
      consume (mean value of three observations) 66 fourth-instar An. subpictus larvae 
      released in a water bowl containing 3 liters of pond water. The consumption rate 
      was significantly higher (p < .05) during the lights-on phase of the experiment
      than during the lights-off phase (t = 2.15). Under field conditions, a
      significant decrease (p < .05) in larval density in dipper samples was observed
      15 days after the introduction of dragonfly nymphs (10 individuals) in concrete
      tanks. The biocontrol potential of the nymphs under field conditions was also
      indicated by a significant increase (p < .05) in the density of mosquito larvae
      15 days after the removal of nymphs. In the control tanks (where no nymphs were
      introduced), mean larval-mosquito density did not differ significantly throughout
      the study period (p > .05).

TI  - Molecular identification of mosquito species in the Anopheles annularis group in 
      southern Asia.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - The Anopheles annularis group of subgenus Cellia Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae)
      includes five currently recognized species in southern Asia: An. annularis Van
      der Wulp, Anopheles nivipes (Theobald) and Anopheles philippinensis Ludlow, which
      are widespread in the region, Anopheles pallidus Theobald, which is known in Sri 
      Lanka, India and Myanmar, and Anopheles schueffneri Stanton, which occurs in Java
      and Sumatra. Identification of the four mainland species based on morphology is
      problematic. In view of the fact that the three widespread species are variously 
      involved in malaria transmission in different parts of the region, we developed a
      species-specific polymerase chain reaction assay based on rDNA internal
      transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences to facilitate entomological and
      epidemiological studies of the four species. The method proved to be reliable
      when tested over a wide geographical area.

PG  - 176-80
AB  - This study was conducted in laboratory to evaluate the efficacy of filtered
      extracellular metabolites of Lagenidium giganteum against all the four instars of
      An. stephensi larvae. Fungal colonies have been cultured in PYG broth and after
      15 days of culturing the fungus, metabolites have been filtered twice by whatman 
      filter paper. These metabolites were again filtered by column chromatography and 
      by rang syringe filters. Filtered metabolites were then used against all instars 
      of An. stephensi larvae. The bioassays were conducted at five significantly
      different concentrations (1.68, 1.99, 2.17, 2.30, 2.40 ppm). The results suggest 
      significant mortality on first three instar larvae and very low on fourth instar 
      larvae.

TI  - Efficacy of Lagenidium giganteum metabolites on mosquito larvae with reference to
      nontarget organisms.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Lagenidium giganteum is a water mold and an effective mosquito control agent with
      limited use due to poor survival and contamination during storage. Invert
      extracellular metabolites of L. giganteum is easy to produce, long shelf life,
      and a potential candidate in tropical climates. This fungus was grown in PYG
      broth in the laboratory at 25 +/- 2 degrees C, and relative humidity was
      maintained at 75 +/- 5% for 15 +/- 2 days. Filtration process of metabolites was 
      done using Whatman filter paper, column chromatograph, and range syringe filters 
      techniques. Then 5-ml fractions were collected and used to assay larvicidal
      efficacies. Larvicidal efficacies were performed against Culex quinquefasciatus, 
      Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti at five different concentrations, viz.
      1.68, 1.99, 2.17, 2.30, and 2.40 ppm. And also, filtrates were assessed against
      four species of nontarget organisms named Daphnia pulex, Cyclopes, Lymnea
      auriculeta, and tadpoles of Rana tigrina with different concentrations. The
      mortality values were subjected by the Probit analysis. The complete mortalities 
      that resulted from applying filtrates dosage on all instars of mosquitoes
      persisted for a period of 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. The efficacies in
      killing instar of three important vectors and safer for nontarget organisms with 
      good biological stability of extracellular metabolites make this a promising
      alternative to mycelium and conidial-based larvicides. It could be regarded as
      fungal-based natural larvicide for the use of vector control.

PG  - 1134-8
AB  - Anopheles (Cellia) philippinensis Ludlow and Anopheles (Cellia) nivipes
      (Theobald) are two closely related, morphologically very similar, mosquito
      species in the Annularis group, which play a supportive role in malaria
      transmission in north-east India. We amplified and performed sequence analysis
      for the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) locus of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene
      of morphologically confirmed specimens of these two species from the states of
      Assam and Nagaland. An. philippinensis and An. nivipes shared 85.2% sequence
      similarity and no intra-species variation was found in the nucleotide sequences
      of the two species. Overall, sequence data of the ITS2 marker revealed that both 
      these species from north-east India differed by as much as have been reported
      from specimens of eastern Thailand.

TI  - Reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin and kdr mutation in Anopheles stephensi
      Liston, a malaria vector in India.
PG  - 678-88
AB  - The Indian urban malaria vector Anopheles stephensi Liston was selected for
      deltamethrin resistance for 25 generations (F25) at larval and adult stages
      separately in the laboratory. There was roughly a 151-fold increase in the lethal
      concentration (LC)50 and a 99-fold increase in the LC90 in larval selection, when
      the F25 was compared with the parent colony. Similarly, adult selection resulted 
      in a 39-fold increase in the LC50 and a 31-fold increase in the LC90 in the
      adults. Knockdown bioassays conducted on adults (selected at the larval and adult
      stages) against the diagnostic concentration of insecticide-impregnated papers,
      namely, deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%), lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05%), and
      cyfluthrin (0.15%), revealed that the adults selected at the adult stage were
      more resistant to deltamethrin and the other pyrethroids than those selected at
      the larval stage. A significant cross-resistance to DDT was noticed only in the
      adults selected at the adult stage, and no cross-resistance to malathion and
      propoxur was observed in the adults of both resistant colonies. Polymerase chain 
      reaction studies revealed an occurrence of heterozygote level of kdr mutation
      (leucine to phenylalanine) in the adults selected at the adult stage. This event 
      was not observed in the adults selected at the larval stage. Moreover, this is
      the first report on the occurrence of kdr mutation in Indian An. stephensi
      resistant to deltamethrin.

AB  - Blood meals of 1,491 Anopheles fluviatilis sensu lato (s.l.), 1,690 An.
      culicifacies s.l., 719 An. annularis s.l., and 358 An. varuna sensu stricto were 
      examined by gel diffusion method. The overall anthropophilic index (AI) was
      78.9%, 1.6%, 3.2%, and 6.7% for An. fluviatilis, An. culicifacies, An. annularis,
      and An. varuna, respectively. Out of 4 anopheline species studied, only 0.2% of
      An. culicifacies blood meals contained blood from humans and cattle. Anopheles
      fluviatilis and An. culicifacies revealed seasonality in their anthropophilic
      index. An. fluviatilis showed a human forage ratio of more than 1, whereas An.
      culicifacies, An. annularis, and An. varuna had forage ratios of 2.6, 2.5, and
      2.4, respectively, for bovine. There was a correlation between the Al of An.
      fluviatilis and the malaria slide positivity rate. This study suggests that the
      use of repellent, insecticide-treated nets will be effective for controlling
      biting mosquitoes inside houses in Orissa.

TI  - On the conspecificity of Anopheles fluviatilis species S with Anopheles minimus
      species C.
PG  - 671-7
AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis and An. minimus complexes,each comprising of at least three
      sibling species, are closely related and important malaria vectors in Oriental
      Region. Recently An. fluviatilis species S, which is a highly efficient malaria
      vector in India, has been made conspecific with An. minimus species C (senior
      synonym) on the basis of homology in 335 base pair nucleotide sequence of D3
      domain of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). We examined the conspecificity of these two
      nominal species by obtaining and analysing the DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal
      loci internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D2-D3 domain of 28S rDNA
      (28S-D2/D3) from those of An. fluviatilis S and An. minimus C. We found that the 
      sequences of An. fluviatilis S are appreciably different from those of An.
      minimus C with pair-wise distance (Kimura-2-parametre model)of 3.6 and 0.7%for
      loci ITS2 and 28S-D2/D3, respectively. Pair-wise distance and phylogenetic
      analyses using ITS2 sequences of members of Minimus and Fluviatilis Complexes
      revealed that An. fluviatilis S is distantly related to An. minimus C as compared
      to any other members of the Fluviatilis Complex. These findings suggest that the 
      two nominal species, An. fluviatilis S and An. minimus C, do not merit synonymy. 
      The study also confirms that the reported species An. fluviatilis X is synonym
      with species S.

      bed nets: experience in armed forces.
PG  - 297-300
AB  - The study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of deltamethrin-impregnated
      mosquito nets on malaria incidence, mosquito density, any adverse side effect
      among users. A field trial was carried out over a period of three years in two
      adjacent military stations at Allahabad (UP), keeping one as a trial and other as
      a control station. During first year, baseline data were collected and during
      next two years residual spray was replaced with use of deltamethrin impregnated
      mosquito nets in trial station. The use of deltamethrin-impregnated mosquito
      nets/insecticide treated bed nets resulted in a significant decline in malaria
      incidence and Annual Parasite Index (API). The average mosquito density of
      Anopheline mosquitoes decreased by 67.8% and Culex by 49.7%. The insecticide was 
      found safe for use amongst troops. Use of deltamethrin-impregnated mosquito nets 
      has beneficial impact on integrated control of malaria.

TI  - Introduction, transmission and aggravation of malaria in desert ecosystem of
      Rajasthan, India.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is an important public health problem in
      northwestern desert part of Rajasthan. Since desert malaria is seasonal or
      unstable, there is a need to study its epidemiology in the totality to address
      factors like how malaria is introduced into desert every year and what are
      desert-specific transmission risk factors leading to epidemics? METHODS:
      Twenty-six villages in irrigated, semi-irrigated and non-irrigated settings of
      the desert have been selected. Periodic investigations were undertaken in all the
      seasons from 2001 through 2002 to determine causes of introduction of disease,
      the factors involved in its transmission and the epidemic risk factors. Standard 
      methods/procedures for mosquito collection, preservation and identification and
      for parasitological studies were employed. Rainfall data were analysed and
      correlated. RESULTS: Importation of malaria infection through individuals was the
      major cause of introduction of disease in all the 12 villages showing some
      initial load of infection. Areas having higher population of cattle in relation
      to humans (human to cattle ratio of 1:25) had less transmission of disease (ratio
      of primary to secondary cases 1:3) as compared to relatively less cattle (human
      to cattle ratio 1:3) resulting into high transmission of disease with 1:47 ratio 
      of primary to secondary cases. Introduced through migration, prospective
      transmission of malaria was observed as a resultant interaction of density of
      three components namely malaria cases, vector density and cattle to human ratio. 
      Rainfall more than average when coupled with more cases of imported malaria leads
      to the eruption of malaria epidemics. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Importation of
      malaria cases was the major cause of seasonal introduction of malaria in the
      desert. This initial or primary parasitic load available in a village leads to a 
      particular transmission quantum depending upon the density of vectors, human and 
      cattle population at a particular time. Areas with more imported cases when
      coupled with profuse vector population lead to epidemic malaria situations in the
      desert.

TI  - A community-based health education programme for bio-environmental control of
      malaria through folk theatre (Kalajatha) in rural India.
PG  - 123
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health education is an important component in disease control
      programme. Kalajatha is a popular, traditional art form of folk theatre depicting
      various life processes of a local socio-cultural setting. It is an effective
      medium of mass communication in the Indian sub-continent especially in rural
      areas. Using this medium, an operational feasibility health education programme
      was carried out for malaria control. METHODS: In December 2001, the Kalajatha
      events were performed in the evening hours for two weeks in a malaria-affected
      district in Karnataka State, south India. Thirty local artists including ten
      governmental and non-governmental organizations actively participated. Impact of 
      this programme was assessed after two months on exposed vs. non-exposed
      respondents. RESULTS: The exposed respondents had significant increase in
      knowledge and change in attitude about malaria and its control strategies,
      especially on bio-environmental measures (p < 0.001). They could easily associate
      clean water with anopheline breeding and the role of larvivorous fish in malaria 
      control. In 2002, the local community actively co-operated and participated in
      releasing larvivorous fish, which subsequently resulted in a noteworthy reduction
      of malaria cases. Immediate behavioural changes, especially maintenance of
      general sanitation and hygiene did not improve as much as expected. CONCLUSION:
      This study was carried out under the primary health care system involving the
      local community and various potential partners. Kalajatha conveyed the important 
      messages on malaria control and prevention to the rural community. Similar
      methods of communication in the health education programme should be intensified 
      with suitable modifications to reach all sectors, if malaria needs to be
      controlled.

      microfilaremic blood.
PG  - 1222-6
AB  - The efficiency of laboratory colonies of mosquitoes such as Anopheles stephensi
      Liston, Aedes aegypti (L.) Liverpool strain, Ae. aegypti wild type, Aedes
      albopictus (Skuse), Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles, Culex sitiens Wiedemann, and
      Armigeres subalbatus Coquillett in supporting the development of Wuchereria
      bancrofti (Cobbold) (Spirurida: Onchocercidae) microfilariae to infective larvae 
      was investigated. The mosquitoes were fed on heparinized microfilaremic human
      blood by using a membrane-feeding unit with Parafilm as membrane. The rate of
      infection, parasite development, and parasite burden were compared with that in
      the known vector mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Cx. quinquefasciatus showed
      the highest percentage of infection, followed by Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain and
      An. stephensi. The rate of development of the parasite was more or less similar
      in all the three species, and infective larvae were found on day 13. When the
      larvae were harvested on day 17, Cx. quinquefasciatus yielded the highest
      numbers, followed by Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain and An. stephensi. The
      percentage of infection was low, and the development was slow in Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus compared with the other susceptible species. The parasite
      developed to second-stage larvae only by day 22 and to infective larvae by day
      28. When 2-wk-old Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were fed on microfilaremic blood, they
      could develop the parasite to infective larvae by day 13 postfeeding. All other
      species of mosquitoes tested were found to be refractory to parasite development.
      It is shown that Cx. quinquefasciatus is the most suitable mosquito host for the 
      production of infective larvae. However, Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain, which is
      commonly used for Brugia malayi filarial parasite, also can be used for
      generation of W. bancrofti infective larvae to circumvent the problem of
      maintaining two mosquito species.

TI  - Studies on sporozoite-induced and chronic infections with Plasmodium fragile in
      Macaca mulatta and New World monkeys.
PG  - 1019-26
AB  - Plasmodium fragile continues to be investigated because of its biologic
      similarities to the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Two strains of
      P. fragile are available for study; one strain is able to infect mosquitoes,
      whereas the other strain is transmissible only by blood inoculation. The Sri
      Lanka strain of P. fragile was transmitted to Macaca mulatta, Macaca
      fascicularis, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus nancymaae, Aotus vociferans,
      and Saimiri boliviensis monkeys via sporozoites that developed to maturity only
      in Anopheles dirus mosquitoes. The prepatent periods ranged from 12 to 35 days
      for macaques and from 15 to 30 days for New World monkeys after intravenous
      injection of sporozoites. Eight rhesus monkeys were infected with the Nilgiri
      strain and followed for 482 days. Parasitemia in 6 animals persisted at
      relatively high density through the period of observation. Erythrocyte,
      hematocrit, and hemoglobin values reached their lowest levels 3 wk after
      infection and slowly recovered; however, the values did not approach preinfection
      levels as long as parasitemia persisted in the monkeys. The mean corpuscular
      volume and corpuscular hemoglobin concentration reached their peak and lowest
      values, respectively, at day 38 and then returned to the preinfection level. The 
      mean corpuscular hemoglobin value decreased to its lowest level at day 87 and
      then returned to preinfection level.

TI  - Identification of two cryptic species in the Anopheles (Cellia) annularis complex
      using ribosomal DNA PCR-RFLP.
PG  - 943-8
AB  - Anopheles (Cellia) annularis Van der Wulp is a complex of two sibling species
      provisionally designated as species A and B and can only be differentiated on the
      basis of the paracentric inversion in the ovarian polytene chromosomes. To
      analyze the distribution of these two species and to develop a molecular method
      for the identification of these two cryptic species, we sequenced the ribosomal
      DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and domain 3 (D3) of A. annularis
      specimens collected from Sonapur (Assam), Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Ranchi
      (Jharkhand), and Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh). We did not find any sequence
      variation among the specimens collected from Assam, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand
      states, whereas two types of sequences were obtained from the specimens collected
      from the state of Uttar Pradesh, which correspond to species A and B of the A.
      annularis complex. Species A was more prevalent among the all four regions
      studied. The ITS2 sequence of species A showed unique restriction sites for MvaI 
      and Eco24I, while species B displayed HinfI and NruI sites. Similarly, the D3
      sequence of species A showed unique restriction site for Alw26I, while species B 
      showed a unique KpnI site. In this study, we report for the first time the
      development of ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism methods for identifying these two cryptic species of the
      Annularis complex.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria in an area of low transmission in central India.
PG  - 812-6
AB  - A longitudinal study on malaria was carried out from 2003 to 2005 in an area of
      unstable malaria in the Panna district in central India. Both Plasmodium vivax
      and P. falciparum were prevalent; however, the risk of P. falciparum malaria was 
      31.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29.6-33.6%), which is four times higher
      compared with that of P. vivax malaria (7.8%, 95% CI = 6.7-9%). An increasing
      trend was recorded in malaria prevalence from 30.2% in 2003 to 46.6% in 2004
      (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6-2.5) that increased to 58.6% in 2005 (OR =
      1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1). This increase was statistically significant (chi(2) =
      120.5, degrees of freedom = 2, P < 0.0001). Anopheles culicifacies was the
      dominant vector of malaria and showed partial (< 50%) resistance to DDT, which
      indicated that DDT can still be used. Improved access to treatment facilities,
      combination therapy, and vector control appears to be the most promising method
      for controlling malaria in this region.

PG  - 156-61
AB  - The sibling species composition of the Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus
      complexes is poorly known in the highly malarious north-eastern region of India
      where these two vector taxa are accountable for most of the malaria transmission 
      among 30.7 million inhabitants. Prevalent members of these two complexes in this 
      part of India were identified using sequences for the second internal transcribed
      spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA. Anopheles baimaii (species D) of the An. dirus
      complex and An. minimus s.s. (species A) of the An. minimus complex were detected
      in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland states. No intraspecific
      variation was observed in the ITS2 sequence (479bp) of An. baimaii whereas a
      single substitution was detected in the ITS2 sequence (372bp) of An. minimus from
      Nagaland state.

TI  - Malaria: anti malarial resistance and policy ramifications and challenges.
PG  - 291-3
AB  - 'The National health Policy 2002 of India and the "Roll Back Malaria " policy
      makers have set up an ambitious goal of reducing malaria mortality and morbidity 
      by 25% by 2007, and by 50% by 2010. To achieve these goals, problems should be
      identified, available evidence analyzed and policy should be changed early.
      Infection with drug resistant malarial parasites has a tremendous impact on
      health (prolonged recurrent illness, increased hospital admissions and death),
      health system (higher cost of treatment) and socioeconomics of the region. In
      view of the evidence of the economic burden of malaria, it has been suggested
      that second line treatment could be considered at 10% failure instead of 25%.
      Effective schizonticidal drugs will not only reduce morbidity and mortality but
      will also reduce transmission. Studies have shown that prevalence of viable (as
      tested by exflagellation test) gametocytes is considerably more after the
      Chloroquine or Chloroquine + Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine treatment compared to
      Quinine. Unfortunately, the only gametocytocidal drug for Plasmodium falciparum, 
      primaquine, is also loosing its efficacy. 45 mg Primaquine reduces gametocyte
      prevalence by 50% while a new drug, 75 mg bulaquine or 60 mg primaquine reduces
      it by 90%. Plasmodium vivax forms 60-70% of malaria cases in India. Relapses
      which occur in 10-20% of cases adds to the burden. Efficacy, as confirmed by
      Polymerase Chain Reaction-Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism (PCRSSCP) to 
      differentiate relapse and re-infection, of standard dose of primaquine (15 mg/day
      for 5 days, even 15 mg/day for 14 days) for vivax malaria is reducing. Fourteen
      day treatment is also impractical as compliance is poor. Newer drugs, newer drug 
      delivery systems are thus needed. Slow release formulations with blood levels
      maintained for one week may be useful. Rationale of giving primaquine in higher
      doses and different timing need to be considered. The genome of Plasmodium
      falciparum and genome of Anopheles gambiae have been unraveled in last past 3
      years. This has given us an opportunity to develop new tools. Whatever be the
      tool, educating health care workers as well as lay public and ensuring
      appropriate use of available drug are essential to achieve our goals of
      controlling malaria.

      microsatellite characteristics per se of five fully sequenced insect genomes
      (fruit-fly, honeybee, malarial mosquito, red-flour beetle and silkworm). InSatDb 
      allows users to obtain microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and
      repeat units); genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon); nature
      (perfect or imperfect); and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). One can 
      access microsatellite cluster (compound repeats) information and a list of
      microsatellites with conserved flanking sequences (microsatellite family or
      paralogs). InSatDb is complete with the insects information, web links to find
      details, methodology and a tutorial. A separate 'Analysis' section illustrates
      the comparative genomic analysis that can be carried out using the output.
      InSatDb is available at www.cdfd.org.in/insatdb.

AB  - Efficacy of Agnique MMF, a monomolecular film formulation, was tested against
      immatures of Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria vector in India, in simulated 
      and natural habitats. Simulated field trials carried out in cement tanks showed
      100% inhibition of adult emergence for up to 1 wk at 0.4 ml/m2 and up to 3 wk at 
      1 ml/m2. A small-scale field trial in tanks and wells at 1 and 2 ml/m2 produced
      more than 75% reduction of late instars and 100% reduction of pupae on day 1. The
      reduction in pupae at 1 and 2 ml/m2 lasted up to 2 wk in tanks and 5 wk in wells.
      These results suggest that Agnique MMF could be used as one of the choices in an 
      urban malaria control program.

      recorded in the mangroves of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, in collections
      made during May and June 2001. Larvae of 43 species were collected from different
      mangrove habitats. Together with collections made in nonmangrove areas, 83
      species in 22 subgenera and 20 genera in total were recorded of which 33 species 
      are new records for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Rhinoskusea wardi, Fl.
      flavipennis, and Ve. consonensis are 3 new country records for India. Collections
      included topotype specimens of St. seampi. Together with species known from
      earlier records, the mosquito fauna of Andaman and Nicobar Islands is updated to 
      107 species in 23 subgenera and 24 genera.

TI  - Wash resistance and bioefficacy of Olyset net--a long-lasting insecticide-treated
      mosquito net against malaria vectors and nontarget household pests.
PG  - 884-8
AB  - During recent years, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) have been
      developed to overcome the problems of low retreatment rates, washing, and erratic
      dose of the insecticide resulting in the dilution of efficacy of the conventional
      insecticide-treated mosquito nets. These nets are treated at factory level with
      insecticide either incorporated into or coated around fibers. Olyset net, a
      polyethylene net with 2% permethrin incorporated within fibers, is one type of
      LLIN. Therefore, these nets were evaluated for their wash resistance and
      bioefficacy against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies Giles and Anopheles
      fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) and other nontarget species. Cone bioassay
      tests produced 100% mortality in these two vector species with 3-min exposure.
      Results of the bioassays on washed nets showed 100% mortality in An. fluviatilis 
      even after 20 washings, whereas in An. culicifacies 100% mortality up to 11
      washings and 80% mortality up to 20 washings were observed. Cone bioassay tests
      also were performed on nontarget mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus Say;
      house fly, Musca domestica L.; American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.);
      head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer; and bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. 
      with 30-min exposure. Except for bed bugs, 100% mortality was observed in these
      nontarget species after 24-h recovery period. In bed bugs, only 25% mortality was
      observed. The density of An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis was significantly
      reduced in houses with Olyset nets compared with those with untreated nets or no 
      nets. Thus, it may be concluded that Olyset nets are highly effective against
      malaria vectors and moderately against other nontarget household insects.

TI  - Malaria control using indoor residual spraying and larvivorous fish: a case study
      in Betul, central India.
PG  - 1512-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of intensified malaria control interventions in 
      an ethnic minority community in Betul using existing tools. METHODS: Two rounds
      of indoor residual spraying with synthetic pyrethroid insecticide were applied
      and larvivorous fish introduced, followed by intensive surveillance for early
      detection of Plasmodium falciparum with rapid diagnostic tests and prompt
      treatment with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine. RESULTS: Pre-intervention surveys
      revealed a very high fever rate in the community in all age groups with a slide
      positivity rate of >50% with >90%P. falciparum. The post-intervention phase
      showed a sharp steady decline in number of malaria cases (beta 0.972; P < 0.0001,
      95% CI 0.35-0.47). Monitoring of entomological results revealed a significant
      decline in both Anopheles species and An. culicifacies (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: 
      A combination of indoor residual spraying and early detection and prompt
      treatment complemented by rapid diagnostic tests and larvivorous fishes
      successfully brought malaria under control. These approaches could be applied in 
      other regions of different endemicity to control malaria in India.

TI  - The use of Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. (Myrtaceae) oil (leaf extract) as a
      natural larvicidal agent against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi Liston
      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 1856-60
AB  - Secondary metabolites obtained from the indigenous plants with proven mosquito
      control potential can be used as an alternative to synthetic insecticides under
      the integrated vector control. The essential oil extract from the forest redgum, 
      Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. (Myrtaceae) was tested against mature and immature
      mosquito vector Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera) under laboratory condition. 
      The extract showed strong larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity. The
      leaf oil extracts showed high bioactivity at high doses. Results obtained from
      the laboratory experiment showed that the leaf extracts suppressed the pupal and 
      adult activity of Anopheles stephensi at higher doses. In general, first and
      second instar larvae were more susceptible to all treatments. Clear dose
      -response relationships were established with the highest dose of 160ppm plant
      extract evoking almost 100% mortality. The results obtained suggest that, in
      addition to their medicinal activities, E. tereticornis can also serve as a
      natural mosquitocide.

TI  - Identification of all members of the anopheles culicifacies complex using
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays.
PG  - 454-60
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies, a complex of five isomorphic sibling species, is a major 
      vector of malaria in India and neighboring countries. The five species are
      provisionally designated as species A, B, C, D, and E. Polytene chromosome
      examination has been the only method available that differentiates four members
      of this complex in areas where species E is not prevalent. However, this
      technique requires the mosquitoes to be in the half-gravid stage and thus limits 
      its application to only about one fourth to one third of the total adult
      collection and excludes immature stages completely. For species E, both polytene 
      chromosome examination and mitotic chromosome examination of F1 males are
      required. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on the D3 domain (D3-PCR)
      of 28S rDNA and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay involving ITS2 of rDNA are available for the
      discrimination of the members of the An. culicifacies complex. However, both
      these can only differentiate species A and D from species B, C, and E. We report 
      here two allele-specific PCR assays (AD-PCR and BCE-PCR) using sequence
      differences in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (CO II) subunit. The
      AD-PCR assay distinguishes species A and D, whereas the BCE-PCR assay
      distinguishes species B, C, and E. Thus, with a combination of two PCR assays,
      namely the D3-PCR/ITS2-RsaI assay, followed by either the AD-PCR or the BCE-PCR
      assay, it is possible to identify individual specimens of any of the species of
      this complex. This assay system is the first, and the best available at present
      to distinguish all sibling species and especially to discriminate non-vector,
      species B from all the vector species, A, C, D, and E, of the An. culicifacies
      complex. Until another DNA-based method involving fewer steps is developed, this 
      assay system can be used in all malaria epidemiologic studies where An.
      culicifacies is prevalent.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a new putative c-type lysozyme from
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - Lysozyme (E.C. 3.2.1.17) activity is reported from the malaria vector Anopheles
      stephensi. The activity was detected in the salivary gland and midgut using
      bacteriolytic radial diffusion assay. Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that 
      higher level of lysozyme activity was maintained in both midgut and salivary
      gland tissues. The activity reached the highest level in 4-8 days old mosquitoes.
      Genomic PCR amplification revealed the presence of at least two putative lysozyme
      genes in the mosquito genome. Preliminary analysis of one of the 413 bp genomic
      fragments showed 56% identity to the lysozyme of mosquito A. gambiae. However,
      the nature and origin of the putative cloned lysozyme gene remains elusive.

TI  - Population interactions between Culex vishnui mosquitoes and their natural
      enemies in Pondicherry, India.
PG  - 84-8
AB  - Population interactions among mosquitoes in the Culex vishnui subgroup, which are
      vectors of Japanese Encephalitis, and their natural enemies were studied in
      Pondicherry, India. We tested the hypothesis that the breakdown of interactions
      between the larvae and their natural enemies due to drought followed by rain was 
      responsible for the sudden increase in the vector population above the threshold 
      for disease transmission during the heavy rainy period. We randomly sampled
      mosquito larvae and their predators in different breeding habitats and subjected 
      the mean densities of prey, predator, and mosquito larvae infected with
      parasites/pathogens to covariate analysis to understand the interaction between
      prey and their natural enemies in relation to environmental factors. In rice
      fields, neither prey nor predator showed any positive correlation with
      temperature, RH, or the number of rainy days. However, the pathogen/parasite of
      mosquito immatures showed a positive correlation with RH. Among the mosquito
      predators, notonectids exhibited a significant positive correlation with Cx.
      vishnui larvae. The parasitic Romanomermis iyengari and pathogenic Coelomomyces
      anopheliscus also showed positive correlations with immatures. No parasites and
      pathogens of mosquito larvae were recorded in shallow water pools (SWP) or cement
      tanks (CT) during the study period. Important predators recorded in SWP were
      notonectids, damselfly nymphs, Diplonychus indicus, and hydrophilids. Dragonfly
      nymphs, gerrids, and tadpole shrimps were recorded in CT. In CT, prey and their
      predators were positively correlated with RH and rainy days. In SWP, there was a 
      highly significant correlation between prey, predators and environmental factors.
      We conclude that rice fields are a stable ecosystem where regular interaction
      occurs between larvae and their natural enemies and a sudden increase in mosquito
      populations is uncommon. In transient habitats, no such stability is present and 
      they become more important as breeding habitats in terms of seasonality and
      number. Shallow water pools should be seriously considered for the control of
      these vectors.

AB  - Leaves of Artemisia annua linn. and Azadirachta indica were extracted in
      petroleum ether and hexane respectively by different methods of extraction i.e.
      cold extraction, reflux extraction and soxhlet extraction. The crude extract
      obtained was tested against third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi. On

      both soxhlet and reflux extraction method showed 100% mortality at 200 ppm after 
      48 hr in case of A. annua. However LC50 (20 ppm) value of crude extract obtained 
      by soxhlet extraction showed better results than reflux extraction (35 ppm)
      method after 72 hr. In case of A. indica, crude obtained by soxhlet showed 100%
      mortality (after 48 hr) at 250 ppm and LC50 of 69 ppm at 72 hr. Reflux extraction
      does not show any appreciable mortality even at 250 ppm concentration.

      humankind.
PG  - 83-93
AB  - Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the protist Plasmodium spp. and it
      currently kills more than one million people annually. The burden of malaria is
      concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. The parasite's
      resistance to commonly used anti-malarial drugs has worsened the situation in the
      poorest countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than
      100 countries suffer from endemic malaria episodes. In addition to numerous
      control measures and treatments, several vaccines are at different research
      stages and trials. We have assayed RTS,S/AS02A, a pre-erythrocytic candidate
      vaccine that has shown promising protection levels in phase IIb trials in
      Mozambique. The vaccine is directed against the sporozoite form of the parasite, 
      which is injected by the mosquito Anopheles spp. The vaccine induces a strong
      antibody response and stimulates Th1 cells-a subset of helper T cells that
      participates in cell-mediated immunity. Recent interest by international funding 
      agencies has provided new inputs into initiatives and programs to fight malaria, 
      which, under normal welfare and adequate social development conditions, is a
      curable disease.

TI  - Composition and larvicidal activity of leaves and stem essential oils of
      Chloroxylon swietenia DC against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 2481-4
AB  - The laboratory bioassay of the essential oil and the isolated compounds from
      Chloroxylon swietenia against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi was carried
      out to evaluate the larvicidal activity. LC50 value estimated for A. aegypti and 
      An. stephensi were 16.5 and 14.9 microg/ml and 20.2 and 19 microg/ml for leaf and
      stem oils, respectively. The three sesquiterpenes pregeijerene, geijerene and
      germacrene D were isolated and their Larvicidal activity was evaluated.
      Pregeijerene and geijerene were observed for the first time in the volatile
      constituents of C. swietenia, however, leaves contained higher amount of
      geijerene compared to stems.

TI  - PCR-RFLP method for the identification of four members of the Anopheles annularis
      group of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 239-44
AB  - The Anopheles annularis group of mosquitoes is widely distributed in Southeast
      Asia and may be locally important as malaria vectors. Members of this group are
      morphologically very similar and often difficult to distinguish, particularly A. 
      nivipes and A. philippinensis. We report the sequence analysis of the rDNA
      internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and Domain-3 (D3) regions of the four
      members of the A. annularis group -A. nivipes, A. philippinensis, A. annularis
      and A. pallidus - and a method for their molecular identification. No
      intraspecies sequence variation was detected among the specimens, while
      interspecific sequence differences were greater for ITS2 than the D3 regions.
      Comparison of the D3 sequences of the four species revealed two SmaI restriction 
      sites in A. nivipes, but only one site in A. philippinensis, A. annularis and A. 
      pallidus. The ApaI site was present in both A. philippinensis and A. pallidus,
      while an NcoI site was present in A. pallidus only. Restriction digestion of the 
      PCR products of D3 fragment individually with SmaI, ApaI and NcoI produced a
      distinctive pattern for all the four species. We present, for the first time, a
      PCR-RFLP method to distinguish the four members of the A. annularis group of
      mosquitoes.

TI  - An approach for the identification of microRNA with an application to Anopheles
      gambiae.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of 20-27 nt long noncoding RNAs,
      involved in post-transcriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes. These miRNAs 
      are usually highly conserved between the genomes of related organisms and their
      pre-miRNA transcript, about 60-120 nt long, forms extended stem-loop structure.
      Keeping these facts in mind miRsearch is developed which relies on searching the 
      homologues of all known miRNAs of one organism in the genome of a related
      organism allowing few mismatches depending on the phylogenetic distance between
      them, followed by assessing for the capability of formation of stem-loop
      structure. The precursor sequences so obtained were then screened through the RNA
      folding program MFOLD selecting the cut-off values on the basis of known
      Drosophila melanogaster pre-miRNAs. With this approach, about 91 probable
      candidate miRNAs along with pre-miRNAs were identified in Anopheles gambiae using
      known D. melanogaster miRNAs. Out of these, 41 probable miRNAs have 100%
      similarity with already known D. melanogaster miRNAs and others were found to be 
      at least 85% similar to the miRNAs of various other organisms.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria transmission in forest and plain ecotype villages in
      Sundargarh District, Orissa, India.
PG  - 917-25
AB  - A study of the epidemiology of malaria transmission was undertaken in 13 tribal
      villages located in forest and plain areas of Sundargarh District of Orissa
      state, India, from January 2001 to December 2003. In forest areas, intense
      transmission of malaria is attributed to the highly anthropophagic vector
      Anopheles fluviatilis sibling species S and is complemented by A. culicifacies
      sibling species C. In plain areas, A. culicifacies sibling species C is
      responsible for malaria transmission. The entomological inoculation rate in the
      forest and plain areas was 0.311 and 0.014 infective bites/person/night,
      respectively, during 2003. Malaria transmission is perennial both in forest and
      plain areas but is markedly low in the plain area compared with the forest area. 
      Plasmodium falciparum accounted for 85.0% of the total malaria cases during the
      study period. In forest and plain areas, the number of P. falciparum cases per
      1000 population per year was 284.1 and 31.2, respectively, whereas the parasite
      rate was 14.0% and 1.7%, respectively. In forest areas, clinical malaria occurs
      more frequently in children aged 0-5 years and declines gradually with increasing
      age. The study showed that villages in forest and plain areas separated by short 
      geographical distances have distinct epidemiology of malaria transmission.

PG  - 155-7
AB  - The larvicidal activity of roots of Hibiscus abelmoschus was evaluated against
      the larvae of mosquitoes in the genera Anopheles and Culex. Mean median lethal
      concentration values of the aqueous extract from the roots of H. abelmoschus
      against the larvae of Anopheles culicifacies, An. stephensi, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus were 52.3, 52.6, and 43.8 ppm, respectively. Efficacy of
      fraction code HAM-4 decreased with an increase in water depth when sprayed at a
      dose calculated by surface area. Fraction code HAM-4 at the rate of 82 ppm showed
      91.1% reduction of larval An. stephensi in a tank, whereas 87.4% reduction of
      larval Cx. quinquefaisciatus occurred in a blocked drain 24 h after application
      of HAM-4 under field conditions.

TI  - Comparative efficacy and persistency of permethrin in Olyset net and
      conventionally treated net against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - The efficacy of the Olyset net was compared to a net treated conventionally with 
      permethrin 10% emulsifiable concentrate at the World Health Organization
      recommended dose. The nets were assessed under laboratory conditions against the 
      mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. Knockdown efficacy for
      the Olyset net was assessed after the first 10 washings and then after the 15th
      and 20th washings. Data were not collected for the conventionally treated netting
      after 5 washings because the conventional treatment was no longer effective. The 
      results of the study indicate permethrin effectively persisted on Olyset net for 
      at least 20 washings, confirming the regeneration of pesticide after each wash.

TI  - Bioefficacy of Olyset nets against mosquitoes in India.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - Olyset nets are highly effective in killing anopheline mosquitoes within 3 min of
      exposure, as evidenced in cone bioassay tests. These nets also showed their
      efficacy on other vector mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus) at
      higher exposure periods. The efficacy remained at approximately 90% even after 20
      washings at an interval of 24 h against Anopheles culicifacies and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. Use of the nets inside the house also resulted in drastic
      reduction of daytime resting density of mosquitoes because of high repellency,
      excitorepellency, and killing action of the nets. Pilot studies are indicated to 
      evaluate the impact of use of Olyset nets on vector-borne diseases, particularly 
      malaria, and its cost-effectiveness in comparison to conventional indoor residual
      spraying.

TI  - Biocontrol efficacy of Cestrum diurnum L. (Solanaceae: Solanales) against the
      larval forms of Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 371-9
AB  - Cestrum diurnum L. (Solanaceae: Solanales) is a multistemmed shrub that is also
      known as 'Day Jasmine'. The efficacy of the plant as a strong biocontrol agent of
      the larval anopheline mosquito was evaluated in the laboratory and bioactive
      ingredients were characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and infrared
      (IR) analysis. Thin layer chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of
      steroidal compound as a bioactive ingredient and IR analysis reported the
      presence of O-H group, C-S bond as a -CH2S group, H bonded -C=O group and
      carbonyl stress of esters. The LC50 value of the active ingredient was determined
      as 0.70, 0.89, 0.90 and 1.03 mg/100 mL-1, for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instar larva 
      respectively in 24 h study period. The active component was analyzed by GLC and
      GLC-MS and altogether 14 components were detected.

TI  - Anopheles culicifacies sibling species B and E in Sri Lanka differ in longevity
      and in their susceptibility to malaria parasite infection and common
      insecticides.
PG  - 153-6
AB  - Members of the Anopheles culicifacies Giles complex (Diptera: Culicidae) are well
      established as the predominant vectors of malaria in Sri Lanka. Until recently,
      only sibling species B was reported to be present in Sri Lanka, which was
      surprising as species B is a poor vector of malaria in India. This was clarified 
      by the identification through Y-chromosome morphology that what was reported as B
      on the island is really a mixture of B and E. The fecundity, longevity and
      insecticide resistance of B and E are of relevance to malaria transmission and
      its control and are reported in this study. The mean egg production of these two 
      sibling species did not differ significantly. The mean age of wild mosquitoes was
      assessed by the Polovodova technique of observing ovarian dilatations. More of
      species E than B had three or more dilatations, i.e. had reached an age at which 
      sporozoites could have developed to maturity, although the difference between the
      species was of borderline significance. Following feeding on Plasmodium vivax or 
      Plasmodium falciparum infected blood, some females of species E developed oocysts
      but none of species B did so. Both sibling species were found fully susceptible
      in laboratory tests to lambdacyhalothrin and deltamethrin, but resistant to DDT
      and partially resistant to malathion.

TI  - Molecular variation, systematics and distribution of the Anopheles fluviatilis
      complex in southern Asia.
PG  - 33-43
AB  - Species of the Anopheles fluviatilis James and Anopheles minimus complexes
      (Diptera: Culicidae) are difficult to distinguish morphologically. Members of the
      two complexes have been confused and, consequently, their distributions and roles
      in malaria transmission are uncertain. We identified numerous mosquitoes from
      China, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Iran by single-strand
      conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and/or sequencing, and analysed the variation in
      the 28S D3 region of ribosomal DNA for members of the Minimus Subgroup and also
      the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) for members of the An.
      fluviatilis complex. The D3 region is highly conserved between taxa and therefore
      could serve as a standard for molecular diagnosis of the subgroup members. D3
      sequence, bionomics and malaria transmission data provide further evidence that
      An. fluviatilis S in India is conspecific with An. minimus C in South-east Asia. 
      An. fluviatilis T has three ITS2 haplotypes (designated T1, T2 and Y) and its
      distribution in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Iran is confirmed. An. fluviatilis U
      is well defined on cytogenetic grounds in Uttar Pradesh, India, but is very close
      to An. fluviatilis T and the two species may hybridize in some regions. Variant
      ITS2 sequences suggest the possible existence of two additional taxa within the
      An. fluviatilis complex, one in Iran and another in India, provisionally
      designated An. fluviatilis forms V and X, respectively. The distributions of
      members of the An. fluviatilis and An. minimus complexes in south-central Asia
      are summarized.

TI  - Relationship between Anopheles fluviatilis & A. stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae)
      catches & the prevalence of malaria cases at Kalsi area in Dehradun district
      (Uttaranchal).
PG  - 151-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Though the relationship between mosquito density and
      transmission of malaria in different regions of the country is known, no studies 
      are available on the relationship between mosquito catches and malaria cases in
      Kalsi area of Dehradun district in Uttaranchal. Hence, the present study was done
      to evaluate the role of anopheline mosquitoes catches and prevalence of malaria
      cases in this area. METHODS: During three consecutive years (2000-2003)
      mosquitoes were collected from 10 villages in Kalsi area twice a month, during
      the morning and evening hours. Identification of anopheline mosquitoes was done. 
      Indoor collected female mosquitoes were dissected to see infection. Sporozoites
      were fixed and stained. Data on temperature and rainfall were also collected.
      RESULTS: As many as 10 species of anophelines were collected during three
      consecutive years - January 2000 to December 2002 at Kalsi block in district
      Dehradun (Uttaranchal). Proportion of the total anopheline species as well as the
      abundance of Anopheles stephensi was found more in the year 2002 than in 2000 and
      2001. Incrimination studies revealed malarial infection (sporozoite positive) in 
      A. fluviatilis and A. stephensi. Of the 5450 blood smears examined, only 50
      (0.91%) were found positive for malarial parasite i.e., Plasmodium vivax. There
      was no case of P. falciparum during the study period. Highest slide positive rate
      (SPR) of 1.107 per cent was recorded in 2002 while in 2001, highest month-wise
      malaria positive cases were recorded in the month of August. September shared
      highest positive cases during 2000 and 2002. While correlating a relationship
      between mosquito catch especially infected ones and monthly parasite incidence,
      the density of A. stephensi showed significantly high correlation (r = 0.819;
      P<0.001). A slight variation in this type of relationship was seen in A.
      fluviatilis. Both temperature and rainfall were found to be positively correlated
      with malaria incidence. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that A. 
      fluviatilis and A. stephensi played a significant role in transmission of malaria
      in Kalsi area of Dehradun.

TI  - Ultra low volume aerosol application of deltacide (deltamethrin 0.5% w/v,
      S-bioallethrin 0.71% w/v & piperonyl butoxide 8.9% w/v) against mosquitoes.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Insecticide in the form of space spray as an ultra low
      volume (ULV) aerosol are used during epidemics of vector borne diseases.
      Deltacide, a formulation comprising of three chemicals viz., deltamethrin 0.5 per
      cent w/v, S-bio-allethrin 0.71 per cent w/v and piperonyl butoxide 8.9 per cent
      w/v is suitable for ULV application. As this combination is found to be effective
      in preventing resistance development tackling the population, which had already
      developed resistance and cause immediate mortality, its synergistic effect was
      tested in Peet Grady chamber, against three species of mosquitoes, viz., Aedes
      aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. METHODS: Blood fed
      females were exposed to ULV application of deltacide in a Peet Grady chamber at
      four dosages viz., 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 ml/m2 and examined for knockdown
      activity at 10 min interval for 60 min. Thereafter, the mosquitoes were removed
      from the chamber and maintained in another room having controlled temperature
      (28+/-2 degrees C) and humidity (60-75%) and observed for recovery, if any, and
      the per cent knockdown was calculated. Mortality rate after 24 h of holding
      period was also determined from moribund and dead adults. RESULTS: Pairwise
      comparison showed that the effect of deltacide spray varied significantly
      (P<0.001) among the three species tested. The effectiveness was significantly
      higher in Ae. aegypti, when compared with that of Cx. quiquefasciatus (P<0.001)
      and An. stephensi (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the
      efficacy of deltacide between Cx. quiquefasciatus and An. stephensi. All species 
      of mosquitoes became inactive i.e., knocked down completely within 60 min of
      exposure at all the dosages tested and mortality observed was 100 per cent after 
      24 h of exposure. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Deltacide when tested in the form 
      of ULV cold aerosol, the dosage 0.01 ml/m2 was effective against both Ae.
      aegypti, and An. stephensi, and 0.02 ml/m2 against Cx. quiquefasciatus, causing
      100 per cent mortality. The efficacy of ULV application of deltacide against
      vector mosquitoes needs to be assessed under field conditions.

TI  - Long-term study of Japanese encephalitis virus infection in Anopheles subpictus
      in Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, South India.
PG  - 288-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Anopheles subpictus Grassi as a vector of
      Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission in Cuddalore, an area of Tamil
      Nadu endemic for the disease. METHOD: We collected 98 pools (4,900 specimens) of 
      wild adult male An. subpictus mosquitoes outdoors during dusk hours and screened 
      them for JEV antigen by antigen-capture Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay.
      Additionally, over a period of 1 year, we tested 166 pools (8,300 specimens) of
      wild adult female An. subpictus mosquitoes collected indoors for JEV. RESULTS:
      Four pools of male An. subpictus tested positive. This indicates possible natural
      transovarial transmission of the virus through An. subpictus. Nineteen female
      pools were positive with a minimum infection rate of 2.3. From January through
      March the maximum infection rate was highest: 5.0 compared with 1.7 between April
      and September and 2.1 from October to December, although the difference was not
      statistically significant. From the 19 positive female pools, four isolates were 
      confirmed as JEV by insect bioassay. CONCLUSION: The role of An. subpictus as a
      secondary vector in JEV transmission in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu lends support to
      the hypothesis of periodic epidemics in the region.

TI  - Observations on anopheline breeding in relation to aquatic plants in different
      breeding habitats of Kheda (Gujarat).
PG  - 187-94
AB  - Water bodies infested with aquatic vegetations may pose problems in mosquito
      control through bio-environmental methods. Paucity of information pertaining to
      association of mosquito breeding with aquatic vegetation was the basis for
      present investigation. The mosquito breeding sites infested with
      solitary/dominating plant community viz., Eichhornia crassipes, Ipomoea aquatica,
      Hydrilla verticillata, Nymphea neuchali, Trapa bispinosa, Lemna paucicostata,
      Trachelomonas spp., Azolla pinnata, Algae spp. and Cynodon dactylon were selected
      for the study. The investigation revealed that breeding of eleven anopheline
      species was associated with Eichhornia in different habitats followed by
      Hydrilla, algae and Cynodon (8 each), Ipomoea and Trapa (6), Lemna. and Nymphea
      (5), Azolla and Trachelomonas (4). An. subpictus was associated with all types of
      vegetation. An. annularis, An. nigerrimus and An. barbirostris were associated
      with nine plant species. An. culicifacies, the principal malaria vector was found
      breeding in association with seven aquatic plants and showed strong association
      with Cynodon, Hydrilla and algae. The species diversity in habitats infested with
      Hydrilla, algae and Cynodon seems to be most favourable for the breeding of An.
      culicifacies. It is suggested that thinning or removal of such vegetations at
      regular interval may help to reduce vector population and enhance the efficacy of
      biological control agents particularly the larvivorous fishes in such habitats.

TI  - Malaria control using deltamethrin impregnated bed nets in a cantonment area at
      Allahabad (U. P.).
PG  - 171-6
AB  - The study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of deltamethrin impregnated
      mosquito nets on malaria incidence, mosquito density, any adverse side effect
      among users and collateral effects on bed bugs and houseflies. A field trial was 
      carried out over a period of three years in two adjacent military stations at
      Allahabad (UP), keeping one as a trial and other as a control station. During
      first year, baseline data were collected and during next two years residual spray
      was replaced with use of deltamethrin impregnated mosquito nets in trial station.
      The use of deltamethrin-treated bed nets resulted in a significant decline in
      malaria incidence and annual parasite index (API). The average mosquito density
      of anopheline mosquitoes decreased by 67.8% and culicine by 49.7%. The
      insecticide was found safe for use amongst troops and had favourable collateral
      effects against bed bugs and flies. Use of deltamethrin impregnated bed nets has 
      beneficial impact on integrated control of malaria.

TI  - Laboratory and field evaluation of Hilmilin against mosquitoes.
PG  - 432-6
AB  - Hilmilin (diflubenzuron), an insect growth regulator, was tested for efficacy
      against Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles culicifacies, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus in the laboratory and in field conditions. Fifty percent and 90%
      lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) of Hilmilin formulations were determined by
      exposing early 4th-stage larvae to serial dilutions of the formulation, and data 
      were subjected to log probit analysis. Two doses (0.004 and 0.008 g/m2) were
      applied in different breeding habitats of mosquitoes with the help of stirrup
      pumps. Percent inhibition of adult emergence was compared according to a
      previously described procedure. Laboratory results revealed that both 25WP
      (wettable powder) and 22SL (semiliquid) formulations showed more or less the same
      degree of efficacy against tested mosquito species (P < 0.05). Of 4 species
      tested, An. stephensi was more susceptible, followed by An. culicifacies, Ae.
      aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. One hundred percent inhibition of adult
      emergence was observed at a dose of 0.0125 ppm (25WP and 22SL) against all
      mosquitoes tested in the laboratory. Both formulations showed almost similar
      effect when applied in the field at doses of 0.004 and 0.008 g/m2 in their
      respective preferential breeding habitats. However, the effect was more
      pronounced at a higher concentration (0.008 g/m2) against all species of
      mosquitoes. Hilmilin at a dose of 0.008 g/m2 can be used to contain mosquito
      breeding in stone quarries, pools, cement tanks, unused wells, unused coolers,
      and irrigation channels.

TI  - Taxonomical observations on Anopheles philippinensis/nivipes group mosquitoes in 
      north-east India.
PG  - 264-70
AB  - To examine the distribution pattern of Anopheles philippinensis and An. nivipes, 
      mosquitoes belonging to An. philippinensis/nivipes group were collected from five
      sites in north-east Indian state of Assam and its adjoining areas and identified.
      Presence of both An. philippinensis and An. nivipes, with predominance of the
      latter taxon, was recorded with conformity on the basis of pupal paddle
      characteristics. Based on adult wing characters, 91.4% specimens were identified 
      as An. philippinensis and 8.6% as An. nivipes with gradually increasing
      proportion of An. nivipes in westwardly direction. An. philippinensis/ nivipes
      was noted to be mid night biter, mainly exophagic and exclusively exophilic. Of
      the two species, An. philippinensis appears to be mostly anthropophilic and
      available in broken forest areas whereas An. nivipes seems to be mostly zoophilic
      and generally found in ecotone zones in plains areas.

PG  - 719-23
AB  - Anopheles philippinensis-nivipes complex mosquitoes, captured in outdoor human
      landing catches and light traps in human dwellings from four different sites in
      Assam state and adjoining areas, were examined (n=1670) for the presence of
      circumsporozoite antigen (CSA) through enzyme linked immunosorbent assays
      (ELISA), using species specific capture monoclonal antibodies, of Plasmodium
      falciparum and two Plasmodium vivax polymorphs (Pv 210 and VK 247). In ELISA, 28 
      pools were found positive for CSA that accounted for minimum sporozoite rate of
      1.7% (95% CI 1.11-2.41). Twenty five percent (7/28) of the positive pools were
      reactive for P. falciparum and between the two polymorphs of P. vivax, VK 247 was
      predominant with 77% (20/26) of all P. vivax positive pools. Results were
      suggestive of most likely involvement of Anopheles philippinensis-nivipes complex
      mosquitoes in malaria transmission in north-east India.

TI  - Larvicidal potential of Nerium indicum and Thuja oriertelis extracts against

PG  - 657-60
AB  - Ethanolic and acetone extracts of Nerium indicum and Thuja orientelis have been
      studied against III instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. Ethanolic extract of N. indicum is found more effective than
      its acetone extract against anopheline larvae with LC50 values of 185.99 and
      148.05 ppm for former and 229.28 and 149.43 ppm for the later after 24 and 48 hrs
      of exposure. The acetone extract with LC50 values of 209.00 and 155.97 ppm is
      more effective in case of culicine larvae than its ethanolic extract with LC50
      494.07 and 194.49 ppm after 24 and 48 hours of treatment. Ethanolic extract of T.
      orientelis is more effective against both the larval species with LC50 values of 
      13.10 and 9.02 ppm after 24 and 48 hours for anopheline and 22.74 and 16.72 ppm
      against culicine larvae. The acetone extract showed LC50 values of 200.87 and
      127.53 ppm against anopheline and 69.03 and 51.14 ppm against culicine larvae.
      Thus ethanolic extract of T. orientelis is an ideal potential larvicide for both 
      types of mosquito larvae.

TI  - Study of social determinants of malaria in desert part of Rajasthan, India.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A longitudinal study on social determinants of malaria
      has been undertaken in different villages of Ramgarh PHC of Jaisalmer district,
      Rajasthan. The study aims to determine social determinants of malaria as
      applicable to existing cast groups of desert part of Rajasthan. METHODS: Out of
      940 households in five villages, 150 households of Rajput community (forward
      community) and Meghwal community (backward community) were selected at random to 
      study whether due to different behaviour of existing caste groups, transmission
      of malaria and its intensity also vary or not. RESULTS: It was found that
      magnitude of malaria was three times more in the Meghwal community as compared to
      Rajput community. In-migration of natives importing malaria was found to be
      prominent cause of more malaria incidence in the backward community.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: An intervention policy aiming to study existing
      status of knowledge among different caste groups of desert areas could lead to a 
      substantial control over in-migration as well as further transmission of disease 
      in the desert part of Rajasthan.

TI  - Effect of food on immature development, consumption rate, and relative growth
      rate of Toxorhynchites splendens (Diptera: Culicidae), a predator of container
      breeding mosquitoes.
PG  - 893-902
AB  - Food utilization by the larvae of Toxorhynchites splendens (Wiedemann) was
      studied in the laboratory by offering larvae of Aedes aegypti Linnaeus, Anopheles
      stephensi (Liston), and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). Quantitative analyses of
      data indicated that immature development was significantly faster with increase
      in food availability. The regression analysis showed that the degrees of the
      relationship between immature duration (Id) and food availability were higher
      when offered early instars of prey (first and second instars) than late instars. 
      Consumption rate (Cr) of the predator increased with increase in food
      availability and this relationship was highly significant when larvae of An.
      stephensi were offered as food. Consumption rate to food level decreased with
      increase in the age class of the prey. There was a significant negative
      correlation between Id and Cr. This aspect helps to increase population turnover 
      of T. splendens in a shorter period when the prey is abundant. Conversely, the
      predator compensated the loss in daily food intake at low food level by extending
      Id thereby attains the minimum threshold pupal weight for adult emergence. There 
      was an increase in the relative growth rate (RGR) of the predator when An.
      stephensi was offered as prey and this was related to the high protein content of
      the prey per body weight. There was a positive correlation between Cr and RGR.
      This adaptive life characteristic strategy of this predator is useful for
      mass-rearing for large scale field release programmes in the control of container
      breeding mosquitoes is discussed.

TI  - Utility of expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads in the control of vector-borne
      diseases.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - The use of chemicals or bio-larvicides for the control of Culex quinquefasciatus 
      and Anopheles stephensi breeding in pit latrines and overhead tanks (OHT)
      respectively is discouraged owing to many undesirable impacts in the environment.
      Due to faecal contamination and poor survival, use of predatory fish in OHTs is
      not feasible. The use of expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads is a potential
      alternative in these habitats. EPS beads not only prevent oviposition but also
      kill the immature by forming a thick blanket on the water surface. A thick layer 
      of 2 cm with beads of 2 mm is sufficient to suppress and prevent mosquito
      breeding. These are cheap, environmentally safe and do not need frequent
      application since they remain on the surface for quiet a long time. Successful
      trials against C. quinquefasciatus breeding in pit latrines, soakage pits, septic
      tanks, etc., have been carried out in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Certain
      trials with EPS indicated reduction in microfilaria (mf) rate besides decline in 
      biting density. In India, EPS beads have also been used on small scale for the
      control of A. stephensi and A. culicifacies breeding in OHTs and unused wells
      respectively. The polystyrene beads have also been reported to be effective in
      the control of mosquito breeding in biogas plants and other industrial
      situations. The practical utility of EPS beads in the control of vector-borne
      diseases has been discussed in the present review.

TI  - Phytoextract-induced developmental deformities in malaria vector.
PG  - 1599-604
AB  - Larvicidal potential of petroleum ether (Pee), carbon tetrachloride (Cte) and
      methanol extract (Mee) of Artemisia annua, Chenopodium album and Sonchus
      oleraceus was observed against malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi Liston. The
      Pee of A. annua with LC50 16.85 ppm after 24 h and 11.45 ppm after 48 h of
      treatment was found most effective, followed by Cte of A. annua and Ch. album,
      Pee of Ch. album and Mee of A. annua. However, no significant larvicidal activity
      was observed in Mee of Ch. album and all the three extracts of S. oleraceous. The
      Pee of A. annua was further investigated for its effect on the metamorphosis and 
      the development of the malaria vector. It influenced the early life cycle of An. 
      stephensi by reducing the percentage of hatching, larval, pupal and adult
      emergence and also lengthening the larval and pupal periods. The growth index was
      also reduced significantly. As the extract has remarkable effect on the
      metamorphosis and high larvicidal potential, it could, therefore, be used as an
      effective biocontrol agent against the highly nuisant malaria vector.

      extract against the malarial vector Anopheles stephensi.
PG  - 15
AB  - The leaf extract of Solanum trilobatum (Solanaceae) was tested under laboratory
      conditions for oviposition deterrent and skin repellent activities against the
      adult mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Concentrations of 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075
      and 0.1% reduced egg laying by gravid females from 18 to 99% compared to
      ethanol-treated controls. In skin repellent tests, concentrations of 0.001,
      0.005, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 % provided 70 to 120 minutes protection against
      mosquito bites, whereas the ethanol control provided only 2.2 minutes of
      protection. Both oviposition deterrent and skin repellent activity were dose
      dependent. The results suggest that the leaf extract of S. trilobatum is an
      effective oviposition deterrent and skin repellent against An. stephensi.

TI  - Malaria transmission risk by the mosquito Anopheles baimaii (formerly known as
      An. dirus species D) at different hours of the night in North-east India.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - The risk of acquiring malaria transmitted by Anopheles baimaii Sallum & Peyton,
      2005, formerly known as An. dirus species D (Sallum et al., 2005) (Diptera:
      Culicidae), at different hours of the night in a forest-fringed village of Assam,
      North-east India was assessed through all-night mosquito landing catches during
      1995-2000. An estimated overall mean biting rate of 36.1 bites/person/night (95% 
      CI = 26.2-45.8), a sporozoite rate of 1.9% (95% CI = 1.1-2.9%) and a parous rate 
      of 58.7% (95% CI = 55.3-62.0%) were recorded. Parous and sporozoite-positive
      females tended to be caught mainly before midnight. The effective entomological
      inoculation rate was the highest (0.249 positive bites/person/night) from 21.00
      to 24.00 hours, suggesting that the second quartile of the night is the most
      risky period for malaria transmission by An. baimaii. Considering that
      approximately 21% of mean inoculations take place before 21.00 hours, it appears 
      that there is a need for appropriate protective measures during the pre-bed time 
      period to supplement the impact of insecticide-treated nets against An. baimaii
      in north-east India.

TI  - Biodiversity of mosquitoes in Manipur State and their medical significance.
PG  - 531-8
AB  - Entomological studies conducted during monsoon and post-monsoon season in Manipur
      State revealed the presence of fifty-five species of mosquitoes under ten genera.
      Out of the seventeen Anopheles species recorded, Anopheles aconitus, An. dirus
      and An. nivipes were recorded for the first time from the state. The present
      study has confirmed the existence of An. dirus, the major malaria vector in the
      Northeast from a selected area of the state. Among Culicines, four species viz., 
      Aedes nigrostriatus, Malaya genurostris, Aediomyia catasticta and Toxorhynchites 
      splendens which were not reported earlier from this state have been recorded in
      the present study. With the addition of these seven species of mosquitoes to the 
      earlier record of mosquitoes so far reported from Manipur, the mosquito fauna
      swells up to one hundred and eleven including the major vectors of malaria of the
      Northeast and the potential vectors of Japanese encephalitis and dengue virus
      transmission in India.

PG  - 399-401
AB  - Mosquito larvicidal activity of crude carbon-tetra-chloride, methanol and
      petroleum ether extracts of Solanum xanthocarpum fruits was examined against
      Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Among the extracts tested,
      carbon-tetra-chloride extract was the most effective with LC50 values of 5.11 ppm
      after 24 hours and 1.27 ppm after 48 hours of treatment against An. stephensi. In
      the case of Cx. quinquefasciatus the petroleum ether extract was observed as most
      toxic with LC50 values of 62.62 ppm after 24 hours and 59.45 ppm after 48 hours
      of exposure period respectively. It is, therefore, suggested that S. xanthocarpum
      can be applied as an ideal potential larvicide against An. stephensi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Bionomics of Anopheles stephensi Liston in the malarious area of Hormozgan
      province, southern Iran, 2002.
PG  - 196-203
AB  - Anopheles stephensi Liston is an important malaria vector in Hormozgan province, 
      where it is the most prevalent anopheline mosquito. It shows two annual activity 
      peaks, one in spring and another in the autumn. In mountainous areas the second
      peak starts earlier than in coastal regions. Adults are endophilic and
      endophagic, but in the hot season when people sleep outside buildings they
      frequently bite outdoors. Larvae are found in a wide-range of habitats, both
      natural and man-made. All three biological forms of the species, occur in the
      province, i.e. An. stephensi stephensi (type form), An. stephensi mysorensis, and
      the intermediate form. An. stephensi mysorensis is found only in
      rural-mountainous areas, whereas the type and intermediate forms occur in
      urban-coastal regions and the rural plains, with the type form predominant. The
      presence of the type form in urban areas and mysorensis in rural areas is
      consistent with the available epidemiological data for malaria in the region and 
      with the finding in India that the type form is an efficient malaria vector
      inhabiting urban areas whereas mysorensis is rural and has a lower vectorial
      capacity. Insecticide susceptibility tests on field collected adult mysorensis
      and adults from laboratory strains of the type and intermediate forms were
      carried out according to WHO standard methods. These showed that all three forms 
      are susceptible to bendiocarb, propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion, deltamethrin,
      permethrin, cyfluthrin, and lambdacyhalothrin, but are resistant to DDT and show 
      low level of tolerance to dieldrin. Examination of the larvicidal activity of
      malathion, fenitrothion, temephos and chlorpyrifos at diagnostic doses showed
      that these stephensi forms are susceptible to all larvicides except fenitrothion.
      Irritability tests to pyrethroid insecticides showed high levels of irritability 
      to permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin, but low irritability to cyfluthrin and
      deltamethrin. The importance of these findings for the epidemiology and control
      of malaria in the region are discussed.

      Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 2077-83
AB  - In recent years, use of environmentally friendly and biodegradable natural
      insecticides of plant origin have received renewed attention as agents for
      disease vector control. Methanol extracts of leaves from the Indian white cedar
      Dysoxylum malabaricum Bedd. (Meliaceae) were tested against mature and immature
      Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera) mosquitoes under laboratory conditions. The 
      extract showed strong larvicidal, pupicidal, adulticidal, and antiovipositional
      activity. The maximum leaf extract concentration tested in this study was 4%,
      which produced pronounced effects. In general, first and second instars were more
      susceptible to leaf extract than older insects. Clear dose-response relationships
      were established, with the highest dose of 4% plant extract causing 97% mortality
      of first instars.

TI  - Morphotaxonomic studies to identify the members of the Anopheles subpictus Grassi
      (Diptera: Culicidae) species complex in riverine villages of District Sonepat,
      Haryana State, India.
PG  - 35-40
AB  - Anopheles subpictus was reported to be a complex of four sibling species
      provisionally designated as species A, B, C and D. Present studies in District
      Sonepat, Haryana have revealed the sympatricity of species A, C and D based on
      the reported distinct morphotaxanomical identification characters in different
      life stages of the mosquito. Studies on field collected adult mosquitoes and
      isofemale progeny did not show variations in the prevalence of sibling species
      and also showed a possibility of use of a single reported morphological character
      in a given life stage for the identification of the members of this complex.

TI  - Efficacy of IGR compound Starycide 480 SC (Triflumuron) against mosquito larvae
      in clear and polluted water.
PG  - 109-16
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An environmental friendly formulation Starycide 480 SC
      (Triflumuron-OMS-2015 ), a new insect growth regulator with chitin synthesis
      inhibitor type mode of action was evaluated against mosquito larvae in laboratory
      and small-scale field trials carried out in and around Delhi. METHODS: The
      formulation was tested in laboratory for its bio-efficacy against late III instar
      mosquito larvae of different species using WHO bioassay procedure. In the field
      formulation was sprayed at doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1 ppm (g/m3) in the natural
      breeding habitats of Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. The impact was assessed by
      monitoring densities of larvae by dipper and observing the reduction in larval
      density and inhibition of adult emergence. RESULTS: In the laboratory,
      formulation was more effective against larvae of Anopheles stephensi and Aedes
      aegypti than Culex quinquefasciatus, but it produced 100% inhibition of adult
      emergence for all mosquito species at a concentration of 0.02 ppm. In the field
      trials, formulation did not produce 100% reduction in the density of late stage
      larvae even at 1 ppm (g/m3), the highest dose tested, but it resulted in 100%
      inhibition of pupal formation of both Anopheles and Culex spp in different types 
      of habitats for 3-7 weeks even at a lower dose of 0.5 ppm. INTERPRETATION AND
      CONCLUSION: Application of triflumuron in the natural breeding habitats in both
      clean and polluted water @ 0.5 ppm (g/m3) resulted in complete inhibition of
      adult emergence of both Anopheles and Culex spp for 3-7 weeks. This formulation
      may be tested in large-scale field trials for further use in the vector control
      programme.

TI  - Larvicidal and mosquito repellent activities of Pine (Pinus longifolia, family:
      Pinaceae) oil.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Various plant-based products are safe and
      biodegradable alternatives to synthetic chemicals for use against mosquitoes. Oil
      of Pinus longifolia is traditionally used for protection against mosquitoes in
      some rural areas but there is no documented report of its use against mosquitoes.
      The present study was undertaken to scientifically evaluate the activity of Pine 
      oil against mosquitoes. METHODS: The oil was procured from the market and its
      contents were chemically analysed. Larvicidal activity of oil was tested in
      laboratory bioassays, while repellent action was studied during whole night bait 
      collections in field by direct application on the skin and after its impregnation
      on mats. RESULTS: Results showed varying degree of larvicidal activity of Pine
      oil against mosquitoes with LC50 values ranging between 82 and 112 ppm. The Pine 
      oil had strong repellent action against mosquitoes as it provided 100% protection
      against Anopheles culicifacies for 11 h and 97% protection against Culex
      quinquefasciatus for nine hours respectively. Electrically heated mats prepared
      from Pine oil provided, 94 and 88% protection against An. culicifacies and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus for 10 and seven hours respectively. INTERPRETAION AND
      CONCLUSION: Pine oil is effective against mosquito larvae at very higher doses
      which are not of any practical utility. However, Pine oil showed strong repellent
      action against An. culicifacies (malaria vector) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (pest
      mosquito). Thus its use could be popularised as mosquito repellent.

TI  - A new domain family in the superfamily of alkaline phosphatases.
PG  - 379-87
AB  - During the course of our large-scale genome analysis a conserved domain,
      currently detectable only in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster,
      Caenorhabditis elegans and Anopheles gambiae, has been identified. The function
      of this domain is currently unknown and no function annotation is provided for
      this domain in the publicly available genomic, protein family and sequence
      databases. The search for the homologues of this domain in the non-redundant
      sequence database using PSI-BLAST, resulted in identification of distant
      relationship between this family and the alkaline phosphatase-like superfamily,
      which includes families of aryl sulfatase, N-acetylgalactosomine-4-sulfatase,
      alkaline phosphatase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate
      mutase (iPGM). The fold recognition procedures showed that this new domain could 
      adopt a similar 3-D fold as for this superfamily. Most of the phosphatases and
      sulfatases of this superfamily are characterized by functional residues Ser and
      Cys respectively in the topologically equivalent positions. This functionally
      important site aligns with Ser/Thr in the members of the new family.
      Additionally, set of residues responsible for a metal binding site in
      phosphatases and sulphtases are conserved in the new family. The in-depth
      analysis suggests that the new family could possess phosphatase activity.

TI  - Impact of DDT spraying on malaria transmission in Bareilly District, Uttar
      Pradesh, India.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Impact of indoor residual spraying of DDT on malaria
      transmission and vector density was evaluated in six villages of Shergarh PHC,
      Bareilly district, Uttar Pradesh under the operational condition of National
      Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) from July 2001 to March 2002 (one
      transmission season only). METHODS: Two rounds of DDT (50% WDP) spraying @ 1 g/m2
      were done both in the experimental and control villages by the state health
      authorities. The spraying in experimental villages was supervised by Malaria
      Research Centre (MRC) whereas the district health authorities supervised the
      operation in control villages. Mass blood surveys were made three times--before
      the first round, in between the first and second rounds and after the second
      round of spraying. The blood smears were examined by the trained microscopists of
      MRC, Haldwani. From the above examinations epidemiological indicators such as
      slide positivity rate (SPR), slide falciparum rate (SFR) and infant parasite rate
      (IPR) were calculated. All malaria positive cases were given radical treatment as
      per NVBDCP schedule. Entomological parameters such as per man hour mosquito
      density, parity rate, gonotrophic condition and adult susceptibility status of
      Anopheles culicifacies to diagnostic dosages of DDT (4%) were monitored as per
      the standard techniques. RESULTS: A total of 988.5 kg of DDT was consumed during 
      two rounds of spray. The house coverage varied from 87 to 95.3%. Parasitological 
      evaluation revealed significant reduction in malaria cases (p < 0.0005) and
      infant parasite rate declined from 2.9 to 0%. Entomological observations revealed
      considerable reduction in the density of malaria vector An. culicifacies despite 
      of its 21.4% mortality against DDT test papers. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The 
      overall results of the study revealed that DDT is still a viable insecticide in
      indoor residual spraying owing to its effectivity in well supervised spray
      operation and high excito-repellency factor.

TI  - Some characteristics of the larval breeding sites of Anopheles culicifacies
      species B and E in Sri Lanka.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles culicifacies Giles, the major malaria vector
      in Sri Lanka, exists as a species complex comprising two sympatric sibling
      species--species B and E. Species E is reported to be the major vector of
      Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum parasites in Sri Lanka, whilst species B is a 
      poor or nonvector as in India. Knowledge of the breeding habits of the two
      sibling species can help in designing optimal vector control strategies. Hence, a
      survey was conducted in Sri Lanka to study the preferential breeding habitats of 
      An. culicifacies species B and E. METHODS: Immature forms of An. culicifacies
      were collected from identified breeding sites in malarious districts. Collected
      larvae were typed for their sibling species status based on mitotic Y-chromosome 
      structure. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science version
      10.0. RESULTS: An. culicifacies immature forms were found in 23 collection sites.
      Among these samples 19 were found to have species E and four to have species B.
      All species B larvae were collected from Tonigala village in the Puttalam
      district. None of the 23 sites was found to have both species B and E. Species E,
      the major vector of malaria, appears to breed in variety of breeding sites which 
      can be of an indication of its adaptive variation to exploit breeding sites with 
      varying limnological characteristics. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The present
      findings have to be taken into account when formulating more effective larval
      control measures. They also show the need for a detailed study of possible
      different preferences for larval breeding sites between species B and E.

TI  - Village-scale evaluation of mosquito nets treated with a tablet formulation of
      deltamethrin against malaria vectors.
PG  - 286-92
AB  - A field trial was carried out in the Sundargarh district of Orissa, India on the 
      efficacy of mosquito nets treated with a tablet formulation of deltamethrin (K-O 
      TAB) against malaria vectors. Treated nets were used in one village, and in the
      two control villages, one used untreated nets and the other used indoor spraying 
      with DDT, without nets. In this area the primary malaria vectors are Anopheles
      culicifacies Giles sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae) and An. fluviatilis James
      s.l., which are both endophagic and endophilic, and fully susceptible to
      deltamethrin. Treatment of a 10-m(2) mosquito net with one of the tablets gave a 
      deltamethrin deposit of 25 mg/m(2). Bioassays repeated on domestically used nets 
      over 7 months showed persistence of almost 100% mortality of An. fluviatilis,
      whereas An. culicifacies showed a decline from 100% to 71% mortality over this
      period, after which the nets were re-treated and bioassays were not continued.
      The sum of collections of mosquitoes resting in village houses and those in exit 
      traps and dead on floor sheets showed a reduction in the numbers of the two
      vector species due to the treated nets, compared with untreated or no nets, but
      no reduction in other anophelines or Culex species. Large proportions of the
      collections of the vector and non-vector anophelines were dead on the floor
      sheets, but among Culex, mortality was delayed. Treated and untreated nets
      reduced the proportion of anophelines that had blood-fed; the treated nets did so
      more effectively than the untreated in the case of An. culicifacies and of Culex 
      mosquitoes. In rooms with treated nets a larger proportion of the total
      collections [dead + live] were in the exit traps, which can be attributed to the 
      excito-repellent effect of deltamethrin. It is easier to pack and handle tablets 
      of insecticide than liquid concentrate and the use of one tablet per net may be
      preferable to making up a large volume of diluted insecticide and dipping many
      nets at a time.

TI  - Molecular identification of Anopheles (Cellia) sundaicus from the Andaman and
      Nicobar islands of India.
PG  - 10-8
AB  - Anopheles (Cellia) sundaicus (Rodenwaldt) is an important malaria vector in the
      Andaman and Nicobar islands of India where it breeds in freshwater as well as in 
      brackish water. To establish the molecular identity of An. sundaicus on these
      islands we analyzed samples from four geographically isolated areas-Teressa,
      Nancowry, Car Nicobar and Katchal islands. PCR-amplification and nucleotide
      sequence analysis were performed for internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and
      domain-3 (D3) of 28S rRNA. The ITS2 region of An. sundaicus from all four islands
      was identical but different from An. sundaicus A of Vietnam and An. sundaicus s.s
      of Malaysia. Furthermore, freshwater and brackish water forms of An. sundaicus
      did not reveal any sequence variation. Similarly, the D3 sequences were identical
      among all An. sundaicus samples from the four islands. D3 sequences for a species
      of the Sundaicus Complex are reported here for the first time and thus could not 
      be compared with other regional isolates of this species. In conclusion, probably
      only one member of the Sundaicus Complex exists on the Andaman and Nicobar
      islands, which breeds in freshwater as well as in brackish water and is different
      from the An. sundaicus A and Malaysian An. sundaicus s.s. The identification of a
      new sibling species of the Sundaicus Complex in these islands is significant from
      the viewpoint of vector control strategies.

TI  - Habitat biodiversity of mosquito richness in certain parts of Garhwal
      (Uttaranchal), India.
PG  - 616-22
AB  - The present study gives an overview of data on the habitat biodiversity of
      mosquitoes occurring in certain parts (viz, Pauri, Tehri and Uttarkashi) of
      Garhwal (Uttaranchal), India. The study was based on the mosquito sampling in 450
      sites/spots in all the 3 districts, each spot having an area of 25 km2 and
      geographically located at varying altitudes between 300 to 3,000 m. While
      compiling the data, published sources in the recent past were also considered.
      The species richness was categorized as most species and least species by
      estimating the top and least 5 percentile of species density in each grid
      cells/spots, respectively. Our database showed that the area harbors 45 species
      from 3 genera. As many as 17 species of Anopheles and 15 species of the genus
      Aedes were recorded during November 2000 to October 2002. Further, there were 13 
      species of Culex, besides few specimens that could not be identified correctly
      because of damage body parts. Collected species of Anophelines were grouped as
      common, uncommon, and rare species depending to their percentage of occupying in 
      grid cells/spots. There were 9 common species, while the number of rare species
      and uncommon species were 3 and 5, respectively. The sites/ spots nearer to
      riverine areas or thick-forested areas showed more diversity of mosquitoes than
      those nearer to non-forested or thin-forested areas. However, the biodiversity
      rich spots were up to 1,200 m altitudes.

TI  - Morphological assessment and molecular phylogenetics of the Funestus and Minimus 
      groups of Anopheles (Cellia).
PG  - 522-36
AB  - A morphological comparison and molecular study of the Afrotropical Funestus and
      Afro-Oriental Minimus groups within the Myzomyia series of Anopheles (Cellia) was
      conducted to determine their phylogenetic affinities. Relationships were
      investigated using morphological characters and ribosomal (D3) and mitochondrial 
      (COII) nucleotide sequences. Cross-identification of specimens from one group by 
      using keys for the other group confirmed their morphological similarity, i.e.,
      members of one group shared the key characters with members of the other group.
      Molecular analyses recognized five clades, not strictly related to geographical
      distribution: the Aconitus, Culicifacies, Funestus, Minimus, and Rivulorum
      subgroups. Morphological observations were congruent with the results of
      molecular analyses. Anopheles leesoni, an Afrotropical species, is closely
      related to the Oriental Minimus complex, and these taxa share a close
      relationship with the Fluviatilis complex that occurs from the Arabian Peninsula 
      through India. The immature and adult stages of An. rivulorum in Africa bear
      morphological characters that distinguish this species from members of the
      Afrotropical Funestus subgroup. A composite scheme of classification based on the
      results and previously published information is proposed for the two groups. It
      is noted that An. fluviatilis species S is conspecific with An. minimus species
      C.

TI  - Evaluation of the mutagenic potential of chlorpyrifos (CPF) using polytene
      chromosomes of Anopheles mosquito.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Diverse cytogenetic tests are employed for short term screening of suspect
      environmental mutagens by using insects and mammals as models. In the present
      paper the polytene chromosomes of a mosquito Anopheles maculatus were used to
      evaluate the mutagenic potential of a widely used organophosphate pesticide
      chlorpyrifos-[o, o-diethyl-o-(3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphothioate]. The
      results are based on the frequency of various structural aberrations encountered 
      in the polytene chromosomes of the larvae treated with LC20 of chlorpyrifos
      (CPF). These aberrations were dominated by inversions, stickiness of the
      chromosomes, heterochromatinization of the bands and lack of polyteny. The
      frequency of various aberrations was highest in the left arm of chromosome number
      2L followed by 2R, 3L, 3R, and X-chromosomes i.e. 2.10 +/- 0.44, 1.84 +/- 0.44,
      1.57 +/- 0.54, 1.31 +/- 0.50, and 0.22 +/- 0.27 respectively. The susceptibility 
      of different chromosomal arms to this pesticide was 2L > 2R > 3L > 3R > X and the
      regions prone to these aberrations have been marked on the polytene chromosome
      map of Anopheles maculatus.

TI  - Reappearance of Anopheles minimus in Singhbum hills of East-Central India.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - Anopheles minimus, an important malaria vector of South East Asia, has reappeared
      in the Singhbum hills, East-Central India where deforestation and DDT residual
      spraying had reportedly eliminated it during the Malaria Eradication Programme.
      The species reported has been identified as sibling species A of the An. minimus 
      complex. An. minimus is susceptible to both deltamethrin and DDT. The study shows
      that the environmental conditions in this region still favour the existence of
      the species and one of the possible reasons for its reappearance may be the
      scaling down of residual insecticide spraying in the area.

      were highly effective as both larvicidal and ovicidal. The essential oil of P.
      anisum showed toxicity against 4th instar larvae of A. stephensi and A. aegypti
      with equivalent LD95 values of 115.7 microg/ml, whereas it was 149.7 microg/ml
      against C. quinquefasciatus larvae. Essential oils of Zingiber officinale and
      Rosmarinus officinalis were found to be ovicidal and repellent, respectively
      towards the three mosquito species. The essential oil of Cinnamomum zeylanicum
      resulted into highest repellent (RD95) values of 49.6, 53.9 and 44.2 mg/mat
      against A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively apart from
      oviposition-deterrent potential.

TI  - Mosquitoes of the mangrove forests of India: part 2--Sundarbans, West Bengal.
PG  - 136-8
AB  - Mosquitoes of 19 species belonging to 9 subgenera and 6 genera, Aedes, Aedeomyia,
      Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex, and Mansonia, were recorded in Sundarbans mangrove
      forest in West Bengal, India. With 6 and 5 species, respectively, the 2 genera
      Culex and Anopheles were found to be more diverse while less than 3 species were 
      recorded in the other 4 genera. Adults were mainly collected resting on walls in 
      the guesthouse, tree holes in the forest, landing on humans in the guesthouse,
      and in the forest, and in light traps. Larvae were obtained from tree holes in
      the forest. The list of species recorded is not conclusive due to the restriction
      in access to most parts of the mangroves due to the presence of tigers. The
      occurrence of the urban species Cx. quinquefasciatus within the Sajnakhali
      sanctuary is indicative of the need to monitor environmental changes that result 
      with the introduction of man-made facilities.

PG  - 131-5
AB  - In this first paper of a series on mosquitoes of the mangrove forests of India,
      details of mosquito species recorded in Bhitarkanika, Orissa, are presented.
      Forty-three species of mosquitoes belonging to 21 subgenera and 13 genera, Aedes,
      Anopheles, Armigeres, Coquillettidia, Culex, Ficalbia, Heizmannia, Lutzia,
      Mansonia, Ochlerotatus, Toxorhynchites, Uranotaenia, and Verrallina, were
      recorded. Predominant larval habitat was the tree holes, from which 15 species
      were taken. Adults were mostly found resting in crab holes, tree holes, and hoof 
      prints in the forest area and on walls in the guesthouse area. About 14 species
      were caught in light traps, while 19 species landed on humans for feeding. Ae.
      franciscoi and Oc. feegradei are 2 new country records for India. Ae. cancricomes
      and Cx. perplexus, known only from Andaman Islands of India, are new records for 
      mainland India.

      three new country records, Culex (Lophoceraomyia) pilifemoralis, Culex
      (Lophoceraomyia) wilfredi, and Heizmannia (Heizmannia) chengi.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - The occurrence of Culex (Lophoceraomyia) pilifermoralis, Cx. (Lop.) wilfredi, and
      Heizmannia (Heizmannia) chengi is reported for the first time from India from
      mosquito collections made in the Jeypore hills, Orissa. In collections made
      during October 1998 from 10 locations, 74 species belonging to 12 genera and 20
      subgenera were recorded. Larvae of 40 species were obtained from different larval
      habitats like bamboo, leaf axils, fallen logs, paddy fields, ponds, ground pools,
      rock pools, streams, and tree holes. Together with the 14 anopheline species from
      earlier records, this report brings to 88 the number of mosquito species in the
      Jeypore hills.

TI  - Altered environment and risk of malaria outbreak in South Andaman, Andaman &
      Nicobar Islands, India affected by tsunami disaster.
PG  - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pools of salt water and puddles created by giant waves from the sea
      due to the tsunami that occurred on 26th December 2004 would facilitate increased
      breeding of brackish water malaria vector, Anopheles sundaicus. Land uplifts in
      North Andaman and subsidence in South Andaman have been reported and subsidence
      may lead to environmental disturbances and vector proliferation. This warrants a 
      situation analysis and vector surveillance in the tsunami hit areas endemic for
      malaria transmitted by brackish water mosquito, An. sundaicus to predict the risk
      of outbreak. METHODS: An extensive survey was carried out in the tsunami-affected
      areas in Andaman district of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India to assess the
      extent of breeding of malaria vectors in the habitats created by seawater
      flooding. Types of habitats in relation to source of seawater inundation and
      frequency were identified. The salinity of the water samples and the mosquito
      species present in the larval samples collected from these habitats were
      recorded. The malaria situation in the area was also analysed. RESULTS: South
      Andaman, covering Port Blair and Ferrargunj sub districts, is still under the
      recurring phenomenon of seawater intrusion either directly from the sea or
      through a network of creeks. Both daily cycles of high tides and periodical
      spring tides continue to cause flooding. Low-lying paddy fields and fallow land, 
      with a salinity ranging from 3,000 to 42,505 ppm, were found to support profuse
      breeding of An. sundaicus, the local malaria vector, and Anopheles subpictus, a
      vector implicated elsewhere. This area is endemic for both vivax and falciparum
      malaria. Malaria slide positivity rate has started increasing during post-tsunami
      period, which can be considered as an indication of risk of malaria outbreak.
      CONCLUSION: Paddy fields and fallow land with freshwater, hitherto not considered
      as potential sites for An. sundaicus, are now major breeding sites due to saline 
      water. Consequently, there is a risk of vector abundance with enhanced malaria
      transmission potential, due to the vastness of these tsunami-created breeding
      grounds and likelihood of them becoming permanent due to continued flooding in
      view of land subsidence. The close proximity of the houses and paucity of cattle 
      may lead to a higher degree of man/vector contact causing a threat of malaria
      outbreak in this densely populated area. Measures to prevent the possible
      outbreak of malaria in this tsunami-affected area are discussed.

      80/53 (elubaquine) in rhesus monkeys.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - The gametocytocidal action of a new enamine analogue of primaquine, elubaquine
      (compound CDRI 80/53, bulaquine), has been evaluated against Plasmodium cynomolgi
      B in rhesus monkeys. Colony bred Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed on
      gametocyte carrying rhesus monkeys prior to and at varying intervals after oral
      administration of a single dose of elubaquine at doses ranging between 0.63 and
      5.00 mg/kg. Complete loss of oocyst development and mosquito infectivity was
      observed within 24 h after administering a single 1.25 mg/kg dose, while higher
      dose of 3.75 mg/kg inhibited oocyst development within 5 h, indicating
      gametocytocidal action of the compound. Elubaquine did not show any action
      against developing oocysts in the vector.

TI  - Entomological studies on malaria in irrigated and non-irrigated areas of Thar
      desert, Rajasthan, India.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Malaria is the major health problem in western Rajasthan
      yet its vector fauna and transmission dynamics thereof is not understood
      properly. The present investigations report complete profile of qualitative and
      quantitative aspects of anopheline species occurring in different settings of
      desert ecosystem. METHODS: Area with irrigation through canal for more than 20
      years (setting I), area with irrigation through canal for 10 years (setting II)
      and area without any irrigation (setting III) have been selected for studies.
      Species identification and their densities (per man hour) was made as per
      standard methods. RESULTS: In village of setting I, during rainy season, An.
      subpictus and An. stephensi were present while during winter season four
      species--An. subpictus, An. stephensi, An. culicifacies and An. annularis were
      collected. In all the villages of setting I, II and III no Anopheles mosquito was
      observed during summer season. In the villages of desert region without any
      irrigation facilities through any canal, the anopheline species were present only
      during rainy season. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: An. stephensi is the major
      malaria vector of desert irrespective of whether the area is canal irrigated or
      not. During summer season absence of vector species in all the villages require
      further studies on micro-ecology of the species under desert conditions.

TI  - A prospective epidemiological study to see if mosquito bite could be responsible 
      for spread of hepatitis B virus infection.
PG  - 29-30
AB  - India is a intermediate prevalence zone for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
      Although mode of transmission of HBV is parenteral, a significant number of
      patients contract HBV without any such history, the so-called "sporadic" cases.
      It is postulated that mosquitoes or other arthropods like bedbugs may be involved
      in transmitting hepatitis B virus (HBV). We hypothesized that, should mosquitoes 
      be responsible for the transmission of HBV, then the incidences of malaria and
      acute hepatitis due to HBV should show a linkage. We have therefore studied the
      frequencies of malaria and acute hepatitis B prospectively over three years to
      see any (a) seasonal changes in the frequencies of the two diseases and (b) any
      correlation between the seasonal frequencies of two diseases. This study was
      carried out at Gujrat research and Medical Institute, which is a busy general
      hospital. Frequencies of malaria and acute hepatitis B were monitored monthly,
      prospectively over a period of three years. Malaria was clearly a seasonal
      disease but no distinct peak for acute hepatitis B was documented. Correlation or
      Linkage between the frequencies of malaria and acute hepatitis B could not be
      documented to suggest that mosquito bite may be responsible for HBV transmission.

TI  - PCR-RFLP of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II and ITS2 of ribosomal
      DNA: markers for the identification of members of the Anopheles culicifacies
      complex (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 92-9
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies Giles is a complex of five sibling species, provisionally 
      designated as species A, B, C, D and E. Species A, C, D and E are vectors of
      malaria in India. Species A, B, C and D can be identified by polytene chromosome 
      examination except in areas where species B and E are sympatric. Species B and E 
      share the same configuration of the polytene chromosomes but can be
      differentiated by examining the mitotic chromosomes of F(1) progeny from field
      collection. Further, polytene chromosome examination method requires the
      mosquitoes to be at the semigravid stage, which limits on use of this method to a
      very small proportion of the population. The present study investigated whether
      the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
      method can be used to differentiate the members of this complex. Complete ITS2
      region along with part of the 5.8S and 28S rDNA sequences (512 bp) and the
      mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (530 bp) were amplified and digested with
      different restriction endonucleases. The Alu I digest of the COII amplicon and
      Rsa I digest of the ITS2 amplicon could distinguish two categories: species A and
      D forming one category and species B, C and E forming another. Further, Dde I
      digestion of the COII amplicon could distinguish species E from species B and C
      within the latter category. The PCR-RFLP techniques developed in this study can
      be applied to areas where species A and B and species B and E are sympatric.

TI  - Six new species of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group, reinterpretation of An.
      elegans and vector implications.
PG  - 158-99
AB  - Among Oriental anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), several major vectors 
      of forest malaria belong to the group of Anopheles (Cellia) leucosphyrus Donitz. 
      We have morphologically examined representative material (> 8000 specimens from
      seven countries) for taxonomic revision of the Leucosphyrus Group. Six new
      species are here described from adult, pupal and larval stages (with
      illustrations of immature stages) and formally named as follows: An. latens n.
      sp. (= An. leucosphyrus species A of Baimai et al., 1988b), An. cracens n. sp.,
      An. scanloni n. sp., An. baimaii n. sp. (formerly An. dirus species B, C, D,
      respectively), An. mirans n. sp. and An. recens n. sp. Additionally, An. elegans 
      (James) is redescribed and placed in the complex of An. dirus Peyton & Harrison
      (comprising An. baimaii, An. cracens, An. dirus, An. elegans, An. nemophilous
      Peyton and Ramalingam, An. scanloni and An. takasagoensis Morishita) of the
      Leucosphyrus Subgroup, together with An. baisasi Colless and the An. leucosphyrus
      complex (comprising An. balabacensis Baisas, An. introlatus Baisas, An. latens
      and An. leucosphyrus). Hence, the former Elegans Subgroup is renamed the Hackeri 
      Subgroup (comprising An. hackeri Edwards, An. pujutensis Colless, An. recens and 
      An. sulawesi Waktoedi). Distribution data and bionomics of the newly defined
      species are given, based on new material and published records, with discussion
      of morphological characters for species distinction and implications for ecology 
      and vector roles of such species. Now these and other members of the Leucosphyrus
      Group are identifiable, it should be possible to clarify the medical importance
      and distribution of each species. Those already regarded as vectors of human
      malaria are: An. baimaii[Bangladesh, China (Yunnan), India (Andamans, Assam,
      Meghalaya, West Bengal), Myanmar, Thailand]; An. latens[Borneo (where it also
      transmits Bancroftian filariasis), peninsular Malaysia, Thailand]; probably An.
      cracens (Sumatra, peninsular Malaysia, Thailand); presumably An. scanloni
      (Thailand); perhaps An. elegans (the Western Ghat form of An. dirus, restricted
      to peninsular India); but apparently not An. recens (Sumatra) nor An. mirans[Sri 
      Lanka and south-west India (Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu)], which is a natural
      vector of simian malarias. Together with typical An. balabacensis, An. dirus and 
      An. leucosphyrus, therefore, the Leucosphyrus Group includes about seven
      important vectors of forest malaria, plus at least a dozen species of no known
      medical importance, with differential specific distributions collectively
      spanning > 5000 km from India to the Philippines.

      laboratory and field conditions of Kumaun foothills of Uttaranchal, India.
PG  - 290-9
AB  - Efficacy of a new Bti formulation was tested in the laboratory and small scale
      field trials against mosquito larvae were carried out from March to June, 2001 in
      different breeding habitats of Kumaun foothill region of Nainital and Udham Singh
      Nagar districts, Uttaranchal state, India. Laboratory tests revealed increased
      efficacy against Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 0.035 mg/L) followed by Aedes
      aegypti (LC50 = 0.0628 mg/L), An. culicifacies sp A (LC50 = 0.184mg/L) and An.
      stephensi (LC50 - 0.2216mg/L). Results of field trials revealed 100% mortality of
      mosquito larvae after treatment with Bti @ 0.5 gm/m2 surface area. The impact was
      similar on different mosquito species breeding in different habitats. However,
      repeated treatments were required due to reappearance of larvae in the breeding
      habitats within a week. No side effects of Bti was observed during field trial on
      non- target organisms (NTOs). Environmental disturbances and man made problems
      affected the spray impact of Bti.

AB  - Evaluation of the potency of four organophosphate (OP) (Malathion, Fenthion,
      Fenitrothion and Temephos) and two synthetic pyrethroid (SP) compounds
      (cypermethrin and deltamethrin) was carried out against larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi, the major malaria vector in district Bikaner (Rajasthan). Different
      concentrations supplied by WHO were used for determining the percent mortalities.
      LC50 values as calculated by probit analysis were 1.2740, 0.0600, 0.0405, 0.0046,
      0.0019 and 0.0016 mg/l respectively for the above six insecticides. Both SP
      compounds were found more toxic followed by temephos among the OP compounds.
      Malathion was found the least toxic while fenthion and fenitrothion were in
      between these two extremes.

TI  - Midgut antibodies reduce the reproductive capacity of Anopheles stephensi
      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 330-4
AB  - Rabbits immunized with polypeptides of midgut of glucose fed A. stephensi
      resulted in high titer of antibodies (10(4)-10(6)) as detected by ELISA. Effect
      of antisera on fecundity, hatchability and engorgement was investigated.
      Fecundity was reduced drastically (62.4%). Eight polypeptides were recognized by 
      the antisera raised against midgut tissues viz., 92, 85, 55, 52, 45, 38, 29 and
      13 kDa. Cross reactivity of these antibodies with different tissues of A.
      stephensi as well as different species of Anopheles was also analyzed. The
      results indicated that anti-mosquito midgut antibodies had the potential to
      disrupt the reproductive physiology of mosquitoes in view of the present study,
      there is a need for further investigation with target antigens.

TI  - Comparative susceptibility of three important malaria vectors Anopheles
      stephensi, Anopheles fluviatilis, and Anopheles sundaicus to Plasmodium vivax.
PG  - 79-82
AB  - The 3 laboratory-colonized malaria vectors, i.e., Anopheles stephensi, An.
      sundaicus, and An. fluviatilis, were studied for their comparative susceptibility
      to Plasmodium vivax sporogony. There was no significant difference in oocyst and 
      sporozoite recruitment by these 3 species, whereas the geometric mean (GM) of the
      oocyst number per midgut was significantly lower in An. fluviatilis as compared
      with that in the other 2 species. There was no difference in the GM of oocyst
      between An. stephensi and An. sundaicus. Adaptability to laboratory conditions
      and susceptibility to plasmodial infection suggest that An. fluviatilis and An.
      sundaicus can also be used as a vector model for vector-parasite interaction
      studies.

PG  - 241-6
AB  - With the introduction of molecular taxonomy of mosquitoes, polytene chromosome
      maps have become indispensable as standard references for locating genes, puffs, 
      and inversion breakpoints of unique DNA sequences. We present a line map and a
      photomap of the salivary polytene chromosomes of Anopheles (Cellia) subpictus
      Grassi, an important emerging vector of malaria in India. In addition, we discuss
      the nature of this species complex consisting of sibling species A, B, C, and D. 
      The comparative study is in relevance to the X chromosome heterozygous inversion 
      differences between 2 allopatric populations of the species and the recognition
      of 4 X-chromosome inversion genotypes viz: species A-X(+a+b), B-X(ab), C-X(a+b)
      and D-X(+ab).

TI  - Situation analysis in a large urban area of India, prior to launching a programme
      of mass drug administrations to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.
PG  - 243-52
AB  - The main strategy now adopted for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) is
      based on mass drug administrations (MDA). Annual administration of antifilarial
      drugs to 65%-80% of the population at risk of the disease is believed to be
      necessary if LF is to be eliminated, at least as a public-health problem, within 
      a reasonable time-frame. To facilitate the development of drug-delivery
      strategies that are sufficient to ensure such high treatment coverages in large
      urban areas, a situation analysis was undertaken in the Indian city of Chennai.
      The subjects interviewed came from households with high, moderate, low or very
      low incomes. A lack of information on the prevalence and socio-economic impact of
      the disease meant that LF was not viewed as a major pubic-health problem in the
      study area, even though cases of elephantiasis and hydrocele were detected in
      2%-8% and 7%-20% of the households investigated. Overall, 40% of the interviewees
      from very-low-income households and 78% of those from middle-income households
      knew that (the parasite causing) elephantiasis was transmitted by mosquitoes.
      Only 4% of the subjects from high-income areas and 1% of those from low-income
      areas were aware that filarial infection was a major cause of hydrocele. Most of 
      the subjects (>55% of each of the four socio- economic groups considered) felt
      that they were not at risk of developing elephantiasis. When specifically asked, 
      only 35% of the subjects from high-income households but 84% of those from
      low-income households said that they would be willing to consume tablets of an
      antifilarial drug (diethylcarbamazine) in MDA to eliminate LF. It is therefore
      unclear whether high-income households in urban areas should be included in MDA
      programmes. The interviewees felt that an intensive campaign of information,
      education, communication and advocacy would be necessary if an effective
      MDA-based programme were to be implemented. Drug distribution through the health 
      services was the most preferred option.Clearly, factors such as a lack of
      appreciation of the socio-economic impact of LF, a general belief that the risk
      of elephantiasis is low, doubts about the need to include all sectors of the
      eligible population in MDA, and a common dependence on private practitioners make
      successful MDA against LF in urban areas a challenging task. On the positive
      side, however, an urban population is often covered by a huge network of
      colleges, private practitioners, non-governmental organizations and residents'
      associations, and such networks provide new opportunities in the development of
      effective drug-delivery strategies.

TI  - Persistence and wash-resistance of insecticidal efficacy of nettings treated with
      deltamethrin tablet formulation (K-O TAB) against malaria vectors.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - Persistence, wash-resistance, and shelf life of mosquito nets treated with a
      water-dispersible tablet formulation of synthetic pyrethroid insecticide
      deltamethrin (K-O TAB) at 25 mg/m2 was evaluated against malaria vectors in
      India. During June 2001, treated and untreated polyester, nylon, and cotton nets 
      were separately distributed in 3 villages and cone bioassays were performed on
      Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi 1 day after treatment and thereafter
      every month for 12 months. The mosquitoes were exposed for 3 min on the nettings 
      (treated and unwashed, or treated and washed once or twice in 3 months, and
      untreated) and knock-down (1 h) and 24 h postexposure mortality were recorded.
      Unwashed polyester nets, and those washed once 1 month after treatment, gave 100%
      mortality in An. culicifacies for 6 months. A 2nd wash at 3 months after
      treatment marginally reduced the insecticidal action. Anopheles stephensi was
      fully susceptible up to 4 months when exposed to unwashed nets but washing
      considerably reduced insecticidal action (65-78% after 2 washes). Treated nylon
      and cotton nets were effective for 4 months on both vectors. Treated nets kept on
      shelf retained 100% efficacy for 10 months. Overall, the treated nets gave a
      considerably long persistence of insecticidal action even after a single wash.
      Treated polyester nets were found most effective. Compared with our earlier
      experiences of using liquid formulations, the tablet formulation is likely to
      have a better community acceptance in treating nets.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Anopheles fluviatilis species complex in the
      Islamic Republic of Iran.
PG  - 257-65
AB  - A species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to identify the
      species composition of the Anopheles fluviatilis complex in the Islamic Republic 
      of Iran. All the amplified DNA samples from specimens collected from different
      areas yielded a fragment of 450 bp size, a PCR product corresponding to that of
      the species denoted as Y. The sequence data from 21 ITS2 [second internal
      transcribed spacer] regions were compared with those publicly available in the
      GenBank database and confirmed that the specimens were 100% identical to species 
      Y of India. Species Y is presumably the same as species T that has no role in
      transmission of malaria in India, whereas An. fluviatilis is known as a secondary
      vector of malaria in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

TI  - Evaluation of bifenthrin treated mosquito nets against anopheline and culicine
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The main rural malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies
      has developed resistance to dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), hexachloro
      cyclo hexane (HCH) and malathion in the state of Haryana in northern India. An
      alternative synthetic pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin was therefore evaluated
      on mosquito nets against anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, in two villages
      Jagdishpur and Garh Mirakpur of Community Health Center (CHC) Badhkhalsa in
      district Sonipat, Haryana state. METHODS: Two formulations of bifenthrin,
      suspension concentrate (SC) and micro-emulsion (ME) were compared with
      micro-capsule suspension (CS) of lambdacyhalothrin. The impact of three doses of 
      bifenthrin (10, 25 and 50 mg/m(2)) impregnated on mosquito nets was compared with
      lambdacyhalothrin (25 mg/m(2)) and untreated control. Quality assessment of
      treatment on treated nets was carried out by residue analysis and the persistence
      of the insecticide on nets was determined by contact bioassays. Efficacy of
      treated nets on mosquito density was assessed by calculating mosquito entry rate,
      immediate mortality, delayed mortality and excito-repellency to the insecticides.
      RESULTS: In susceptibility tests An. culicifacies was susceptible to bifenthrin
      (0.1% test papers) and to lambdacyhalothrin (0.05% test papers). Bioassays on
      treated nets against A. culicifacies recorded 100 per cent mortality up to tenth 
      fortnight for all the doses of impregnation with bifenthrin (SC and ME) and
      lambdacyhalothrin (CS). Ring-net bioassays against An. culicifacies showed median
      knock-down time between 3.1 to 11.4 min. Behavioural indices were also studied
      for anopheline and culicine mosquitoes. The reduction in entry rates of
      anopheline and culicine mosquitoes into the rooms with treated nets compared to
      control indicated good efficacy with all the formulations and doses of the
      insecticides. INTERPRETAION AND CONCLUSION: Indoor (immediate) mortality of
      mosquitoes with bifenthrin ME formulation was relatively lower compared to SC
      fomulation of bifenthrin and based on delayed mortility and continued
      susceptibility in bioassays, bifenthrin ME at the rate of 10 mg/m(2) dose was
      found suitable for the impregnation of mosquito nets for phase III trial.

TI  - Larval susceptibility of Ajuga remota against anopheline and culicine mosquitos.
PG  - 608-10
AB  - The objective of the present study is to determine the bioefficacy of different
      crude extracts of Ajuga remota against anopheline and culicine larvae. Larval
      susceptibility of crude carbon-tetrachloride, methanol and petroleum-ether
      extracts of Ajuga remota leaves was observed against the malaria vector,
      Anopheles stephensi and the filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus. Among the 
      extracts tested, petroleum-ether extract was the most effective with LC50 values 
      of 0.033% after 24 hours and 0.029% after 48 hours of treatment against the
      larvae of Anopheles stephensi. In the case of the larvae of Culex
      quinquefasciatus, the carbon-tetra-chloride extract exhibited maximum efficacy
      with LC50 values of 0.043% after 24 hours and 0.026% after 48 hours of exposure, 
      respectively. It is, therefore, concluded that Ajuga remota can be applied as an 
      ideal larvicide against An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - DDT indoor residual spray, still an effective tool to control Anopheles
      fluviatilis-transmitted Plasmodium falciparum malaria in India.
PG  - 160-8
AB  - This study from two districts of Orissa State which are endemic for Plasmodium
      falciparum transmitted by Anopheles fluviatilis and A. culicifacies investigated 
      the impact of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) indoor residual spraying, in
      view of the ongoing discussion on phasing out DDT in India. Based on their high
      annual parasite incidence and logistical considerations, 26 villages in
      Malkangiri and 28 in Koraput district were selected for DDT spraying. For
      comparison, six and four unsprayed villages were chosen from the same districts. 
      In each district, the prevalence of malaria infection and incidence of malaria
      fever, indoor resting density and parous rate of the vectors, and their
      susceptibility to DDT were monitored in six and three villages selected randomly 
      from the sprayed and unsprayed groups respectively. Anopheles fluviatilis was
      susceptible to DDT while A. culicifacies was resistant. DDT residual spraying
      with 1 g/m(2), was carried out in October-November 2001. Spraying 74-86% of human
      dwellings and 100% of cattle sheds brought down the indoor resting density of A. 
      fluviatilis by 93-95%. This was associated with a significant reduction of
      incidence of malaria fever as well as prevalence of malaria infection from
      November to February in both districts. The spraying also seemed to impact on
      vector longevity, and a residual effect of DDT on the sprayed walls was observed 
      up to 10-12 weeks despite re-plastering. Hence DDT spraying can still be an
      effective tool for controlling fluviatilis-transmitted malaria. Although this
      species is exophilic, its nocturnal resting behaviour facilitates its contact
      with the sprayed surfaces. DDT is still useful for residual spraying in India,
      particularly in areas where the vectors are endophilic and not resistant.

TI  - Field evaluation of biolarvicides in Surat city, India.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Two bacterial larvicide (bio-larvicide)
      formulations--Bacticide and VectoBac containing viable endospores and delta
      endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis H-14 were evaluated in 2001
      for their mosquito larvicidal efficacy under the operational conditions of urban 
      malaria control programme in Surat city, India. METHODS: Larvicides were applied 
      at the recommended dose in selected breeding habitats of Anopheles (An.
      stephensi), Aedes (Ae. aegypti) and Culex (Cx. quinquefasciatus) and reductions
      in the densities of III and IV instars were compared with that of untreated
      matched controls. RESULTS: At the construction sites in cemented tanks/chambers
      VectoBac produced reduction in the density of III and IV instar larvae of An.
      stephensi (98-100%) and Ae. aegypti (100%) in the first week of application
      whereas Bacticide produced 71-100% reduction in An. stephensi and 100% in Ae.
      aegypti. Re-application of VectoBac on Day 10 caused better control up to Day 20 
      when compared with Bacticide. In stagnant water pools, VectoBac produced
      27.6-85.3% reduction in the larvae of An. subpictus and 18.5-83.8% in those of
      Cx. quinquefasciatus whereas Bacticide produced 23.3-30.3% and 39-97.2% reduction
      in An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larval densities in the first week post
      application, respectively. Bacticide application gave better impact on Cx.
      quinquefasciatus larvae in the second week after re-application as compared to
      VectoBac. In storm water drains, VectoBac caused respectively 6.2-100% and
      6.4-97.6% reduction in An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae in the first
      week of application whereas Bacticide produced 100% and 13.3-98.8% reduction in
      An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larval densities, respectively.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Both the formulations were equally effective on An. 
      subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae after a second application. The results
      showed that application of these biolarvicides would be required at 7-10 day
      intervals. The health workers engaged in the application of biolarvicides
      reported a better ease of handling and application of the liquid formulation
      (VectoBac) than the wettable powder formulation (Bacticide).

TI  - Impact of residual spraying of Reldan against Anopheles culicifacies in selected 
      villages of District Ghaziabad (Uttar pradesh), India.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Indoor residual spraying of Reldan 40% EC @ 0.5 and 1
      g/m2 was done in Tatarpur and Chauna villages, respectively in Dhaulana PHC,
      Distt. Ghaziabad (U.P.) to evaluate its impact against Anopheles culicifacies and
      malaria incidence. Results were compared with that of Piyawali village which was 
      taken as control area. METHODS: Four rounds of spray were done from 1999--2000 in
      human dwellings and cattlesheds in experimental villages. Entomological
      parameters--man hour density, parity rate, sporozoite rate, etc. were monitored
      using standard procedures. Epidemiological indicators such as SPR, SFR,
      cases/000, Pf/000 were also calculated. Cone bioassays as per WHO method were
      also carried out to assess the persistence of the insecticide on different
      surfaces. RESULTS: Entomological results revealed that spraying of reldan @ 0.5
      g/m2 resulted in significant reduction in adult densities of An. culicifacies in 
      sprayed villages over the control village. Spraying also resulted in reduction of
      percent parous females, reduction in malaria incidence (p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION
      & CONCLUSION: Reldan showed high efficacy @ 0.5 g/m2 in controlling the densities
      of An. culicifacies and malaria incidence. However, double dosage of reldan @ 1
      g/m2 can be used for comprehensive vector control provided > 95% spray coverage
      is achieved.

TI  - Follow-up studies after withdrawal of deltamethrin spraying against Anopheles
      culicifacies and malaria incidence.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - Follow-up studies were carried out from 1989 to 1998 after withdrawal of
      deltamethrin indoor spraying to evaluate the recovery rate of a population of
      Anopheles culicifacies resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
      hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in selected villages in Uttar Pradesh State, India.
      The study revealed 82.4-96.5% reduction in adult density of An. culicifacies and 
      72.7-96% reduction in malaria incidence in the area sprayed with deltamethrin at 
      20 mg/m2 as compared to a control area sprayed with HCH, for 5 successive years
      even after withdrawal of deltamethrin spray. The impact was very clear when the
      annual falciparum incidence was compared with that of the control area. The
      vector population gradually started recovering after 5 years. However, the slide 
      falciparum rate remained below 4 even after 10 years of withdrawal of spraying.
      The study revealed that indoor residual spraying of deltamethrin would be
      cost-effective, at least in areas where malaria is transmitted by An.
      culicifacies, which is primarily a zoophilic species and associated with malaria 
      epidemics. In view of this, a review of the insecticide policy and strategy of
      vector control is urgently needed because of the possible risks associated with
      the presence of nonbiodegradable insecticide in the environment, as well as to
      minimize the costs of operation and to enhance the useful life of insecticides.

TI  - Impact of residual spraying of bendiocarb against the malaria vector Anopheles
      culicifacies in selected villages of the Ghaziabad District, Uttar Pradesh,
      India.
PG  - 418-23
AB  - A longitudinal study was carried out to evaluate the bioefficacy of indoor
      residual spraying of bendiocarb 80% wettable powder (WP) at 0.2 and 0.4 g/m2
      against Anopheles culicifacies, a principle malaria vector, and the impact of
      bendiocarb use on malaria incidence in selected villages of the Ghaziabad
      District, Uttar Pradesh, India. The control village was sprayed with malathion at
      1 g/m2 in 2001. Two rounds of bendiocarb spraying were carried out in each year
      from 1999 to 2001. Bendiocarb applications resulted in significant reduction in
      densities of adult An. culicifacies and other mosquito species in villages when
      compared to that of the control village (P < 0.05). Bioassay tests revealed that 
      persistence of insecticide against An. culicifacies at 100% mortality was
      observed for about 10, 8, and 10 wk on mud, cement, and brick wall surfaces,
      respectively. Epidemiological evaluation revealed that malaria cases were
      significantly reduced after 1 year of spraying (P < 0.05) and by 2001, no
      Plasmodium falciparum was recorded in either of the bendiocarb-sprayed villages. 
      The study revealed that indoor residual spraying of bendiocarb 80% WP at 0.2 g/m2
      produced effective control of resistant An. culicifacies, provided that >95%
      human-dwelling room coverage is achieved in both 1st and 2nd rounds of spraying
      at an interval of 10 wk in areas where malaria is a seasonal problem.

TI  - Variations in the insecticide-resistance spectrum of Anopheles stephensi after
      selection with deltamethrin or a deltamethrin-piperonyl-butoxide combination.
PG  - 861-71
AB  - When the larvae of Anopheles stephensi, a malaria vector, were selected with
      deltamethrin for 40 successive generations, there was a 60-fold increase in
      larval resistance to deltamethrin but no increase in the resistance of the adult 
      mosquitoes. This result, and the observation that deltamethrin selection of
      adults for 40 generations resulted in only a six-fold increase in adult
      resistance to deltamethrin, indicated some stage specificity. When F(24)
      deltamethrin-resistant larvae were selected with 1:5 deltamethrin-piperonyl
      butoxide (deltamethrin-PBO), instead of deltamethrin alone, for 16 generations,
      the level of resistance to deltamethrin in the F(40) larvae was reduced by
      6%-21%. Similarly, selection with deltamethrin-PBO of adults of the parental
      strain for 20 generations reduced the speed of the development of resistance to
      deltamethrin, compared with that seen using selection with deltamethrin alone.
      Deltamethrin selection appears to select initially a monooxygenase-based
      mechanism. When the monooxygenase-based mechanism is blocked, by treatment with
      PBO, selection of a kdr-type mechanism is accelerated, as is evident from
      increased cross-resistance to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)
      in the adults selected with deltamethrin-PBO. The implications of these results
      are discussed in terms of the management of the larval and adult stages of An.
      stephensi .

TI  - The changing dynamics of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum in central India:
      trends over a 27-year period (1975--2002).
PG  - 239-48
AB  - The changing epidemiology of malaria since 1975 was studied in a tribal forested 
      belt of central India, Chhattisgarh state, which is the second most highly
      malarious state in India. Chhattisgarh, which accounts for 2% of the total
      population of the country, contributed >16% of the total malaria cases, 23% of
      Plasmodium falciparum, and 7% of deaths due to malaria in the country.
      Retrospective analysis further revealed that, in 1975--76, P. vivax was the
      predominant species (58%); however, since 1979, P. falciparum showed a steady
      upward trend (50%), and in 2002. P. vivax reduced to 28%. Between 1986 and 2000, 
      P. falciparum cases reported by the National Anti Malaria Programme have
      increased 500%, and the number of deaths also showed a similar alarming increase.
      From 2000 to 2002, though the number of malaria infections and number of deaths
      declined sharply as a result of intensive intervention measures (30% and 95%,
      respectively), which included new drugs like Sulfadoxine Pyrimethamine and
      Arteether under Enhanced Malaria Control Programme, the proportion of P.
      falciparum has held steady without any decline. Moreover, along with Anopheles
      fluviatilis, the traditional vector in the forest, An. culicifacies has also
      established itself in the forest. The comeback of malaria and establishment of
      new vectors was largely due to the deterioration of health services along with
      emergence of resistance in P. falciparum to Chloroquine and in An. culicifacies
      to DDT. Therefore, a more diversified malaria control program might be needed for
      sustainable malaria control.

TI  - Larvivorous fish in wells target the malaria vector sibling species of the
      Anopheles culicifacies complex in villages in Karnataka, India.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Malaria was a major problem in a sericulture area of Karnataka, south India,
      where Anopheles culicifacies s.l. and A. fluviatilis s.l. were considered to be
      the main vectors. Sibling species complexes of these two species were analysed in
      three ecologically different villages. Among A. culicifacies, only sibling
      species A and B were found. In Puram, a village with 22 wells, species A
      predominated; species B predominated in a village with four wells and a stream,
      and in a village with a stream and no wells. Poecilia reticulata fish were
      introduced into all wells and streams in the villages, and after one year no
      vectors were found in Puram, and all, or nearly all, A. culicifacies were species
      B in the other two villages. All A. fluviatilis belonged to the sibling species
      T. Blood meal analysis indicated that a few of the A. culicifacies collected had 
      fed on humans while all the A. fluviatilis had fed on bovines. Before the
      introduction of fish, the annual parasite incidence for malaria was high in
      Puram, but much lower in the other two villages. From 1998 (over one year after
      release of fish) until 2003, no malaria cases were detected in the three
      villages.

AB  - An entomological survey in Kurnool and Mahboobnagar districts of Andhra Pradesh
      state, India was undertaken in January, 2002 to find out vector population of
      Japanese Encephalitis and their susceptibility status to different insecticides. 
      Five Culicine species viz. of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, Cx.
      pseudovishnui, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. gelidus were captured during the survey.
      Another suspected vectors Anopheles subpictus and An. hyrcanus were also
      prevalent in the study villages. The larval population showed a high degree of
      resistance to Fenthion and Temephos. The test mortality to DDT ranged between 75%
      and 90%. The mortality of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx vishnui and An. subpictus
      ranged from 85% to 95%. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus is susceptible to Deltamethrin and 
      Cyfluthrin. Cx. vishnui showed 80 % and 85% mortality to DDT and Malathion
      respectively.

TI  - Resting behavior and malaria vector incrimination of Anopheles stephensi in Goa, 
      India.
PG  - 317-8
AB  - Malaria in Goa, India, has been endemic ever since an outbreak occurred in 1986. 
      Anopheles stephensi Liston has always been suspected as a malaria vector in this 
      area. Due to lack of knowledge on its resting behavior, sufficient adult females 
      could not be collected and incriminated as vectors in the past. In this study
      mosquito collections were conducted in three endemic urban and suburban areas of 
      Goa. In well-built houses, 67 h of collections did not yield a single An.
      stephensi mosquito, although other species were encountered. However, collections
      in construction sites and workers' huts for 151 h yielded, besides other mosquito
      species, 38 An. stephensi females resting in 15 types of sites at a height
      varying from 30 cm to 2.4 m. Of the 37 of these mosquitoes tested for the
      presence of circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by an ELISA technique, 1 was found to 
      be Plasmodium falciparum CSP positive.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria transmission and development of natural immunity in a
      malaria-endemic village, San Dulakudar, in Orissa state, India.
PG  - 457-65
AB  - We describe the epidemiology of malaria in San Dulakudar, a village in Sundargarh
      District in the state of Orissa in eastern India. Malaria transmission is
      perennial with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting for greater than 80% of malaria 
      cases. Transmission intensity varies with season with high transmission after the
      monsoon rains in autumn and winter, low transmission in summer, and intermediate 
      transmission in spring. The anthropophagic mosquito Anopheles fluviatilis was
      identified as the main vector for malaria transmission. Based on observations of 
      spleen rates and supported by data on malaria parasite prevalence and malaria
      incidence, San Dulakudar can be classified as a hyperendemic area for P.
      falciparum malaria. Parasite prevalence and malaria incidence rates decrease with
      age, suggesting that residents of San Dulakudar develop immunity to malaria. The 
      study demonstrates the presence of regions in the Indian subcontinent such as
      Sundargarh District where P. falciparum is the primary cause of malaria and where
      malaria transmission rates are comparable to those found in many parts of Africa.

TI  - Physiographic and entomologic risk factors of malaria in Assam, India.
PG  - 451-6
AB  - Fever surveys were conducted in several districts of the Indian state of Assam to
      ascertain the prevalence of malaria in relation to vector abundance, entomologic 
      inoculation rates (EIRs), and geographic location of human settlements. Anopheles
      minimus were incriminated, but their relative abundance and biting rates varied
      among districts, and no significant correlation was observed between these two
      indicators (r = 0.43, P = 0.34). Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant
      parasite species except in two districts where P. vivax was the majority
      parasite. The EIRs per person/night were 0.46-0.71 in P. falciparum-predominant
      areas and 0.12 in the district where P. vivax predominated. The correlation of
      percentage of fever cases positive for malaria infection in each district with
      the corresponding EIR was not significant (r = 0.6, P = 0.21). Malaria cases were
      detected in all months of the year but peaked during May-June, which corresponded
      to the months of heavy rainfall. These were also the months with highest
      incidence of infection with P. falciparum. Malaria cases were observed in all age
      groups of both sexes, and there was clustering of cases in villages near the
      vector-breeding habitat (perennial seepage streams), and foothill villages.
      However, malaria incidences were consistently lower in villages within 5 km of
      the nearest health care facility, which were in town areas. The data presented
      are indicative of low-to-moderate levels of malaria transmission by An. minimus, 
      and would be of value for developing future intervention strategies.

TI  - Prediction of 3-D structures of fucose-binding proteins and structural analysis
      of their interaction with ligands.
PG  - 545-50
AB  - The importance of fucose-binding proteins stems from the presence of fucose as
      terminal sugars in H and Lewis (a) blood groups. Recently, the structure of a
      complex between Anguilla anguilla agglutinin (AAA) and alpha-L-fucose has been
      worked out at 1.9 A resolution. The structure of AAA characterizes the novel fold
      of an entire lectin family. In the present study, molecular modeling techniques
      have been used to identify new proteins that can provide a similar fucose binding
      module in the newly discovered genomic sequences using the above mentioned
      structural information. We modeled 3-D structures of three such proteins, namely,
      ebiP5322 protein of Anopheles gambiae, a pentraxin of Xenopus laevis, and the fw 
      gene product of Drosophila melanogaster. alpha-L-fucose was docked in the binding
      pockets of the modeled structures followed by energy minimization and molecular
      dynamic runs to obtain the most probable structures of the complexes. Properties 
      of these modeled complexes were studied to examine the nature of physicochemical 
      forces involved in the complex formation and compared with AAA-alpha-L-fucose
      complex. It was found that ebiP5322 protein of A. gambiae and the pentraxin of X.
      laevis can provide a fucose-binding fold similar to AAA. We studied structures of
      four protein-fucose complexes to examine the electrostatic potential surfaces
      around the binding site and concluded that a highly positive-charged surface was 
      not a necessary condition of fucose-binding.

TI  - An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for the differentiation of
      members of the Anopheles culicifacies complex.
PG  - 275-80
AB  - Anopheles culicifacies, the principal vector of malaria in India, is a complex of
      five cryptic species which are morphologically indistinguishable at any stage of 
      life. In view of the practical difficulties associated with classical
      cytotaxonomic method for the identification of members of the complex, an
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) assay targeted to the D3 domain
      of 28S ribosomal DNA was developed. The assay discriminates An. culicifacies
      species A and D from species B, C and E. The assay was validated using
      chromosomally identified specimens of An. culicifacies from different
      geographical regions of India representing different sympatric associations. The 
      assay correctly differentiates species A and D from species B, C and E. The
      possible use of this diagnostic assay in disease vector control programmes is
      discussed.

PG  - 109-18
AB  - Larvicidal efficacy of Teknar HP-D, an improved biolarvicidal formulation of
      Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. israelensis (Bti), against Anopheles stephensi, Culex
      quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti was determined in the laboratory, and in field
      the efficacy of the formulation was tested against Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding 
      in cesspits, unused wells and drains. The toxicity of the formulation to Gambusia
      affinis (larvivorous fish), Notonecta sp. and Diplonychus indicus (water bugs)
      was also evaluated in the laboratory. Teknar HP-D was field tested at three
      recommended dosages, 1, 1.5 and 2l/ha, selecting five habitats for each dosage.
      Another five habitats were kept untreated as controls. Ae. aegypti showed
      greatest susceptibility to the Bti toxin in the laboratory. In cesspits, all the 
      three dosages caused >80% reduction of pupal recruitment up to day 6
      post-treatment, indicating that a weekly application at the lowest would be
      necessary for sustained control. The residual activity of the formulation was
      longer in unused wells, causing >80% reduction of pupal recruitment for 17 days
      from the day of treatment. In controlling pupal recruitment the three dosages
      produced equal effect. Application of Teknar HP-D at 1 l/ha once in three weeks
      is therefore recommended to control Cx. quinquefasciatus in unused wells.
      However, in drains, >80% reduction of pupal recruitment was observed for only 3
      days and hence, application of Teknar HP-D at 2 l/ha that caused significantly
      higher level of reduction twice in a week at 3-day interval is necessary. At
      dosages from 0.032 to 3.2 mg/l (ppm), Teknar HP-D was non-toxic to Gambusia fish.
      The two predatory water bugs, Notonecta sp. and Diplonychus indicus that fed on
      the surviving larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus exposed to the sub-lethal doses
      (LC(50) and LC(80)) of Teknar HP-D were safe with out having any mortality.

      Part-I.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mosquito fauna diversity in mountainous areas of Garhwal
      region was studied during November 2000 to October 2002 to correlate the
      altitudinal vegetation and distribution of mosquitoes. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes 
      and mosquito immatures were collected using WHO methods and identified using
      standard keys and catalogues. Altitude of mosquito habitat was measured using
      portable altimeter and also by GPS. RESULTS: Altogether 34 species in five
      genera--Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Uranotaenia were encountered in
      the present study in the altitude range of 300 to 2000 m. Majority of the
      mosquitoes were found in between 300 to 900 m altitude except Culex vagus and
      Anopheles maculatus, which were found throughout the range. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: The mosquitoes were categorised into six groups based on their
      altitudinal distribution. The areas at lowest elevation were having the greatest 
      number of species but not the corresponding greater number of specimens in the
      present study.

TI  - Evaluation of pirimiphos-methyl (50% EC) against the immatures of Anopheles
      stephensi/An. culicifacies (malaria vectors) and Culex quinquefasciatus (vector
      of bancroftian filariasis).
PG  - 10-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In India, temephos and fenthion are used as larvicides
      in fresh and polluted waters. Since use of same insecticide may precipitate
      resistant, as an alternative bioefficacy of pirimiphos-methyl--an
      organophosphorus insecticide was evaluated against immatures of Anopheles and
      Culex species in different breeding habitats in District Ghaziabad (U.P.) and
      Goa. METHODS: Laboratory bioassays were carried out using standard WHO procedure.
      LC50 and LC90 were calculated using Probit analysis. Abbott's formula was used to
      calculate per cent corrected mortality in laboratory exposures while, Mulla's
      formula was applied for calculating per cent reduction in mosquito immatures
      under field conditions. RESULTS: Pirimiphos-methyl was found to be most effective
      against larvae of An. stephensi followed by An. culicifacies and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. The LC50 and LC90 values against three species were 0.023,
      0.032 and 0.04 ppm; and 0.045, 0.057 and 0.114 ppm respectively. In field,
      pirimiphos-methyl @ 200 g a.i./ha against Anopheles species and @ 300 g a.i./ha
      against Culex species can produce > 80% reduction in density of immatures up to
      one week in different habitats. Pirimiphos-methyl < 0.25 ppm is not toxic to
      fish. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Pirimiphos-methyl is more effective against
      anophelines in clean water than culicines in polluted water. This larvicide
      should not be used at a concentration above 0.25 ppm in habitats harbouring the
      larvivorous fish.

TI  - Epidemiological and entomological aspects of malaria in forest-fringed villages
      of Sonitpur district, Assam.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Detailed epidemiological and entomological studies were 
      undertaken in forest-fringed villages and a Tea Estate in Sonitpur, Assam to
      assess the malaria situation. METHODS: Door-to-door active surveillance was
      carried out to collect blood samples. Thick and thin blood smears stained with
      Giemsa were used for malaria parasite detection. Mosquito collections were made
      using CDC miniature light-traps and hand catch methods from dusk-to-dawn.
      RESULTS: 48% SPR, 49.1 Pf% was recorded from the study villages. Children between
      10 and 14 years were most sufferers. Per trap night density of mosquitoes in
      human dwellings was 204.3 and in cattlesheds--908.7, An. minimus accounted for
      20.7% of total malaria vectors. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results showed
      high malaria risk in the study villages. High vector density with high parity
      rate, poor socio-economic conditions, lack of awareness, poor sanitation and
      congenial atmosphere for mosquito proliferation are aggravating the malaria
      situation more complex in the study area.

AB  - Laboratory bioassay of the essential oil extracted from an indigenous plant,
      Ipomoea cairica, commonly known as 'Railway creeper', was carried out against the
      larvae of four vector species of mosquitoes in order to evaluate its mosquito
      larvicidal effect. Bioassay test revealed that the essential oil of the plant
      possess remarkable larvicidal properties as it could induce 100% mortality in the
      larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus (100 ppm), Aedes aegypti (120 ppm), Anopheles
      stephensi (120 ppm), and Culex quinquefasciatus (170 ppm) mosquitoes at
      concentrations rangeing from 100 to 170 ppm. The LC(50) and LC(90) values
      estimated for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi, and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus were 14.8 and 78.3, 22.3 and 92.7, 14.9 and 109.9, and 58.9 and 
      161.6 ppm, respectively. The essential oil was found to be most highly toxic to
      the larvae of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus followed by Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi, and
      Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.

TI  - Role of the prevalent Anopheles species in the transmission of Plasmodium
      falciparum and P. vivax in Assam state, north-eastern India.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - In north-eastern India, Anopheles minimus, An. dirus and An. fluviatilis are
      considered the three major vectors of the parasites causing human malaria. The
      role in transmission of the other Anopheles species present in this region is
      not, however, very clear. To examine the vectorial role of the more common
      anopheline mosquitoes, the heads and thoraces of 4126 female Anopheles belonging 
      to 16 species (collected using miniature light traps set in human dwellings in a 
      foothill village in the Jorhat district of Assam state) were tested, in ELISA,
      for the circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum or the VK-210
      and VK-247 polymorphs of P. vivax. Sixty-five pools of head-thorax homogenates,
      representing 10 different species of Anopheles, were found reactive, giving an
      overall minimum prevalence of infection (MPI) of 1.58%, with a 95% confidence
      interval (CI) of 1.21%-2.0%. Among the CSP-reactive pools of mosquitoes, 31% were
      positive only for P. falciparum, 45% only for P. vivax VK 247, 6% only for P.
      vivax VK 210, and 18% for both P. falciparum and P. vivax VK 247. The results
      indicate that not only the proven vector, An. minimus s.l. (MPI = 0.71%), but
      also several species of Anopheles previously considered unimportant in the
      epidemiology of malaria, especially An. aconitus (MPI = 3.95%), An. annularis
      (MPI = 5.8%), the An. hyrcanus group (MPI = 0.48%), An. kochi (MPI = 1.28%), the 
      An. philippinensis-nivipes complex (MPI = 0.94%), and An. vagus (MPI = 3.87%),
      are important vectors in the foothills of Assam.

TI  - Piperitenone oxide as toxic, repellent, and reproduction retardant toward
      malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Anophelinae).
PG  - 691-8
AB  - Anopheles stephensi (Liston) is a well-known vector of malarial parasite in
      tropical countries. The developing trend of resistance in mosquitoes toward
      synthetic mosquitocidal agents makes their management extremely difficult.
      Effectiveness of essential oils with aroma therapeutic values seems to be an
      emerging tool to combat this vector. Piperitenone oxide isolated from essential
      oil of a new genotype, Mentha spicata L. variety viridis, has been evaluated for 
      larvicidal, ovicidal, oviposition-deterrent, developmental toxicity, and
      repellent properties against various stages of A. stephensi. The results
      indicated the higher efficacy of piperitenone oxide than the crude essential oil 
      of M. spicata variety viridis in all the bioassay experiments. The lethal
      response of piperitenone oxide and the oil toward fourth instar larvae showed
      LD50 values of 61.64 and 82.95 microg/ml, respectively. Female adults of A.
      stephensi exposed to the oil laid approximately 42 times less number of eggs at
      the dose of 60.0 microg/ml as compared with control, whereas exposure of
      piperitenone oxide at the same dose completely inhibited the oviposition.
      Furthermore, piperitenone oxide also completely inhibited egg hatching at the
      dose of 75.0 microg/ml in ovicidal assay. Developmental toxicity studies showed
      the significant developmental inhibition potential of the compound and oil.
      Additionally, piperitenone oxide was found to be highly toxic and repellent
      toward adults of A. stephensi as compared with oil.

AB  - Changes in polypeptides pattern of haemolymph, midgut, ovary and salivary glands 
      of female mosquito A. stephensi were studied when fed upon anti-mosquito
      haemolymph antibodies. The expression of almost all polypeptides was reduced in
      haemolymph and ovary of the immune fed mosquitoes as compared to control.
      However, there was no significant difference in case of midgut and salivary
      glands. Seven polypeptides 100, 90, 84, 80, 62, 19 and 12.5 kDa were absent in
      haemolymph and five 92, 90, 80, 60 and 55 kDa were absent in ovaries. Changes in 
      the polypeptide pattern have been correlated with the fecundity reduction due to 
      immunized blood feeding.

TI  - Transmission of malaria and its control in the northeastern region of India.
PG  - 1073-6
AB  - Let alone the eradication, malaria control itself has amounted to be a challenge,
      and is detrimental to the all round development of the northeastern region of
      India. Focal outbreaks are frequent taking heavy tool on human lives. Plasmodium 
      falciparum is the predominant parasite species and is solely responsible for
      increased morbidity and mortality. The region contributes bulk of P. falciparum
      cases for the rest of India, and its proportions are increasing. Efficient
      vectors like Anopheles minimus, Anopheles fluviatilis and Anopheles dirus
      persistently support transmission of malaria. The present review gives a
      comprehensive account of the factors responsible for transmission of the disease 
      with focus on vector bionomics, its prevention and control.

      lambdacyhalothrin, and etofenprox at 25 mg/m2 by standard methods. Repellent,
      excito-repellency, killing, and airborne actions were monitored from dusk to dawn
      by hourly collection of mosquitoes that entered and rested in rooms and also
      females that landed on treated and untreated mosquito nets. Results revealed
      15.3-22.9% repellent action, 98.3-99.3% excito-repellency action, and 100%
      mortality of females that landed on treated fabrics. No significant differences
      were observed in the efficacy of different synthetic pyrethroids against
      anophelines. However, against Culex quinquefasciatus Say there was a significant 
      difference between deltamethrin and etofenprox. Control of anophelines was more
      pronounced than Cx. quinquefasciatus. There was no pronounced airborne action
      with any insecticide tested. Synthetic pyrethroids with strong airborne action
      may be more appropriate for impregnation of mosquito nets.

TI  - Malaria vectors in the changing environment of the southern Punjab, Pakistan.
PG  - 442-9
AB  - The Pakistani Punjab experienced several devastating malaria epidemics during the
      twentieth century. Since the 1980s, however, malaria has been at a low ebb, while
      in other areas of Pakistan and neighbouring India malaria is on the increase.
      This raises the question of whether transmission in the Pakistani Punjab may have
      been influenced by a change in vector species abundance or composition, possibly 
      induced by environmental changes. To investigate this question,
      routinely-collected government entomological data for the period 1970 to 1999 for
      the district of Bahawalnagar, in the Indus Basin irrigation system in the
      southern Punjab, was analysed. Our findings suggest that Anopheles stephensi has 
      increased in prevalence and became more common than A. culicifacies during the
      1980s. This shift in species dominance may be due to the large-scale ecological
      changes that have taken place in the Punjab, where irrigation-induced
      waterlogging of soil with related salinization has created an environment
      favourable for the more salt-tolerant A. stephensi. Some biotypes of A. stephensi
      are suspected of being less efficient vectors and, therefore, the shift in
      species dominance might have played a role in the reduced transmission in the
      Punjab, although further research is needed to investigate the effect of other
      transmission-influencing factors.

      & Nicobar Islands, India.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - A field study was carried out to evaluate the mosquito repellent action of
      Cymbopogan martinii martinii Stapf var sofia oil in tribal village of Car Nicobar
      Island. Results revealed that application of 1 ml of the oil provided 98.7%
      protection in indoor and 96.52% in outdoor conditions during 12 h period of
      observation from the bites of An. sundaicus. Cymbopogan martinii martinii Stapf
      var sofia oil is an indigenous product, its application is safe and can be widely
      used for protection from malaria.

TI  - Bioecology of An. philippinensis in Andaman group of islands.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Studies on bioecology of An. philippinensis a vector of malaria was carried out
      in eight islands of the Andaman group. It was found that An. philippinensis
      preferred to rest and bite outdoors. Maximum biting was observed during 1800 to
      2100 hrs on both cattle and human bait. The maximum breeding of An.
      philippinensis was recorded in slow moving stream followed by ponds with
      vegetation. The breeding sites infested with Chara and Spirogyra algae were most 
      favourable whereas, with Lemna and Oscillatoria were unfavourable for the
      proliferation of this species. The breeding association of An. philippinensis was
      found with other seven anopheline species in different breeding habitats.
