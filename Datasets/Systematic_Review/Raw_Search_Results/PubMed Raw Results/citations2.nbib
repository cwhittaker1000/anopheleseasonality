TI  - Mitochondrial DNA-based genetic diversity of Anopheles nivipes in North East
      India.
PG  - 4236-4239
AB  - Malaria is a major public health problem in north-east India mainly transmitted
      by Anopheles baimai and An. minimus while Anopheles nivipes plays an important
      supportive role. The genetic diversity of An. nivipes in north-east India was
      investigated by employing two mitochondrial DNA markers namely NADH dehydrogenase
      5 (ND5) and cytochrome oxidase sub unit II (COII). High genetic diversity in An. 
      nivipes was observed by the detection of 16 haplotypes among 30 sequences of ND5 
      gene and 29 haplotypes among 29 COII sequences. Anopheles nivipes of north-east
      India was significantly differentiated genetically with that of neighboring
      South-east Asian An. nivipes as revealed by pairwise FST values of 0.127 (p <
      0.01) and 0.044 (p < 0.001) for ND5 and COII genes, respectively, suggesting
      geographical barriers to gene flow in this species between the two geographical
      areas resulting in significant population structuring.

TI  - An investigation on the diversity of mosquitocidal bacteria and its relationship 
      with incidence of vector borne diseases.
PG  - 84-97
AB  - Control of mosquitoes is the most important aspect of public health, as
      mosquitoes transmit many human diseases, including the fatal infection, Japanese 
      encephalitis. This paper addresses the isolation of new mosquitocidal bacteria
      from soil samples in the Union Territory of Pondicherry, India, where, no
      clinical cases of vector borne infections have been reported. Bacterial isolates 
      from soil samples were screened for potential mosquitocidal strains and bioassays
      against mosquito vectors (Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes
      aegypti) were carried out. Genomic DNA of potential mosquitocidal isolates was
      amplified and species identification was carried out using BLASTn program (NCBI).
      Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of mosquitocidal bacteria revealed
      seven potential isolates. SDS-PAGE results have shown that there was considerable
      difference in the protein profiles. Numerical analysis revealed 4 distinct groups
      at similarity level 25%. The relationship between VBDs and prevalence of soil
      mosquitocidal bacteria in the study sites has elicited considerable interest in
      the diversity of mosquitocidal bacteria and their application for mosquito borne 
      diseases control.

TI  - Feeding stage, species, body part and sex-specific activity of glutathione
      S-transferase in mosquito.
PG  - 65-75
AB  - In the present study, the feeding stage, body parts, development and sex specific
      activity of Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were observed in different mosquito
      species (Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, An.
      culicifacies, An. annularis, An. subpictus, An. vagus). GST activity was assayed 
      spectrophotometrically at 23 degrees C, using a UV Max microplate Reader, to
      measure the rate of conjugation of GSH to CDNB. A significant species-specific
      difference in the activity of GST was noticed, highest being in unfed Ae. aegypti
      (41.2 nmol/min/mg) followed by unfed Cx. quinquefasciatus (7.9 nmol/min/mg) and
      the least in unfed An. stephensi (5.8 nmol/min/mg). In all the species the GST
      activity was found to be significantly higher in fully fed and gravid stages
      compared with the unfed, while the enzyme activity was reduced after egg laying
      either to the level of unfed animals or well below its level in all the
      experimental species. The GST activity was found to be higher in the abdominal
      region of all the experimental species in comparison with the other body parts
      (head and thorax). The GST activity of An. stephensi increased gradually through 
      the larval stages and reached the maximum level in the pupae and remained at that
      level in the newly emerged adults. However, its activity declined markedly (10
      fold) with ageing from 5 to 40 days. A significant sex-related difference in the 
      specific activity of GST was found in An. stephensi where approximately 3.5 fold 
      lower activity was observed in males compared with its females, whereas no
      significant variation was noticed in Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The
      study corroborates the fact that GSTs are differentially regulated by multiple
      mechanisms in response to xenobiotics modulation in situation-specific manner
      such as species, sex, feeding and developmental stage. The knowledge of
      situation-specific modulation of GST will provide a better understanding of GST
      based insecticide resistance mechanism which is essential for the design of
      sensitive monitoring methods and for an effective insecticide resistance
      management. The findings are significant in terms of the methods used to control 
      mosquito vector population.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of few select indigenous plants of North East India against
      disease vector mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 17-23
AB  - Mosquitoes are the vectors of several life threatening diseases like dengue,
      malaria, Japanese encephalitis and lymphatic filariasis, which are widely present
      in the north-eastern states of India. Investigations on five local plants of
      north-east India, selected on the basis of their use by indigenous communities as
      fish poison, were carried out to study their mosquito larvicidal potential
      against Anopheles stephensi (malaria vector), Stegomyia aegypti (dengue vector)
      and Culex quinquefasciatus (lymphatic filariasis vector) mosquitoes. Crude
      Petroleum ether extracts of the roots of three plants viz. Derris elliptica,
      Linostoma decandrum and Croton tiglium were found to have remarkable larvicidal
      activity; D. elliptica extract was the most effective and with LC50 value of
      0.307 mug/ml its activity was superior to propoxur, the standard synthetic
      larvicide. Half-life of larvicidal activity of D. elliptica and L. decandrum
      extracts ranged from 2-4 days.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119666 [doi]
AB  - Vector control is one of the major global strategies for control of malaria.
      However, the major obstacle for vector control is the development of multiple
      resistances to organochlorine, organophosphorus insecticides and pyrethroids that
      are currently being used in public health for spraying and in bednets. Salivary
      glands of vectors are the first target organ for human-vector contact during
      biting and parasite-vector contact prior to parasite development in the mosquito 
      midguts. The salivary glands secrete anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory
      biologically active molecules to facilitate blood feeding from the host and also 
      inadvertently inject malaria parasites into the vertebrate host. The Anopheles
      stephensi mosquito, an urban vector of malaria to both human and rodent species
      has been identified as a reference laboratory model to study mosquito-parasite
      interactions. In this study, we adopted a conventional proteomic approach of
      2D-electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to
      identify putative differentially expressed annotated functional salivary proteins
      between An. stephensi susceptible and multiresistant strains with same genetic
      background. Our results show 2D gel profile and MALDI-TOF comparisons that
      identified 31 differentially expressed putative modulated proteins in
      deltamethrin/DDT resistant strains of An. stephensi. Among these 15 proteins were
      found to be upregulated and 16 proteins were downregulated. Our studies interpret
      that An. stephensi (multiresistant) caused an upregulated expression of proteins 
      and enzymes like cytochrome 450, short chain dehyrdogenase reductase,
      phosphodiesterase etc that may have an impact in insecticide resistance and
      xenobiotic detoxification. Our study elucidates a proteomic response of salivary 
      glands differentially regulated proteins in response to insecticide resistance
      development which include structural, redox and regulatory enzymes of several
      pathways. These identified proteins may play a role in regulating mosquito biting
      behavior patterns and may have implications in the development of malaria
      parasites in resistant mosquitoes during parasite transmission.

AB  - Mosquito control protein from Bacillus thuringiensis gets inactivated with
      exposure to sunlight. To address this issue, the potential of synthetic and
      natural dye was investigated as sunlight protectants. Bt SV2 in absence of dyes
      when exposed to sunlight showed reduced effectiveness against the fourth instars 
      of mosquito larvae. Whereas acriflavin, congo red and violacein were able to
      maintain 86.4%, 91.6% and 82.2% mosquito larvicidal efficacy of Bt SV2 against
      IVth instars larvae of Anopheles stephensi Meigen after exposure to sunlight.
      Similarly, beetroot dye, acriflavin, congo red and violacein maintained 98.4%,
      97.1%, 90.8% and 70.7% larvicidal activities against Aedes aegypti Linnaeus after
      sunlight exposure. Prodigiosin was found to be the best photo-protectant by
      simultaneously protecting and enhancing Bt activity by 6.16% and 22.16% against
      A. stephensi and A. aegypti, respectively. Combination of dyes with Bt
      formulations can be a good strategy for mosquito control programmes in tropical
      and sub-tropical regions.

TI  - Identification of chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of essential oil 
      from Murraya exotica L. (Rutaceae) against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the phytochemical composition and larvicidal
      effect of leaf essential oil from Murraya exotica against early fourth-instar
      larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Gas
      chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses
      revealed that the essential oil contained 27 components. The major chemical
      components identified were beta-humulene (40.62%), benzyl benzoate (23.96%),
      beta-caryophyllene (7.05%) and alpha-terpinene (5.66%). The larval mortality was 
      observed after 12 and 24 h of exposure period. The results revealed that
      essential oil showed varied levels of larvicidal activity against A. aegypti, A. 
      stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. After 12 h of exposure period, the larvicidal 
      activities were LC(5)(0) = 74.7 and LC(9)(0) = 152.7 ppm (A. aegypti), LC(5)(0) =
      56.3 and LC(9)(0) = 107.8 ppm (A. stephensi ), and LC(5)(0) = 74.4 and LC(9)(0) =
      136.9 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus) and the larvicidal activities after 24 h of
      exposure period were LC(5)(0) = 35.8 and LC(9)(0) = 85.4 ppm (A. aegypti),
      LC(5)(0) = 31.3 and LC(9)(0) = 75.1 ppm (A. stephensi), and LC(5)(0) = 43.2 and
      LC(9)(0) = 103.2 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus). These results suggest that leaf
      essential oil from M. exotica is a promising and eco-friendly source of natural
      larvicidal agent against A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Ovicidal and adulticidal potential of leaf and seed extract of Albizia lebbeck
      (L.) Benth. (Family: Fabaceae) against Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and
      Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae).

AB  - Several diseases are associated to the mosquito-human interaction. Mosquitoes are
      the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, arboviral
      encephalitis, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever.
      These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and
      livestock around the world. In the present study, hexane, benzene, chloroform,
      ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of leaf and seed of Albizia lebbeck were
      assayed for their toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi. The mean percent
      hatchability of the eggs was observed after 48 h post-treatment. The percent
      hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and
      directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed moderate 
      ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract showed the highest ovicidal
      activity. One hundred percent mortality was observed at 250, 200, and 150 ppm for
      leaf methanol extract and 375, 300, and 225 ppm for seed methanol extract of A.
      lebbeck against C. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti, and An. stephensi,
      respectively. The adulticidal activity of plant leaf and seed extracts showed
      moderate toxic effect on the adult mosquitoes after 24 h of exposure period.
      However, the highest adulticidal activity was observed in the leaf methanol
      extract of A. lebbeck against An. stephensi where the LC(5)(0) and LC(9)(0)
      values were 65.12 and 117.70 ppm, respectively. Compared to leaf extracts, seeds 
      have low potency against three mosquito species. No mortality was recorded in the
      control. Our data suggest that the crude hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl
      acetate, and methanol solvent extracts of A. lebbeck have the potential to be
      used as an eco-friendly approach for the control of the An. stephensi, Ae.
      aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. These results suggest that the leaf and seed
      extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of mosquitoes.

AB  - Mosquitoes are blood-feeding insects and serve as the most important vectors for 
      spreading human diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and
      filariasis. The continued use of synthetic insecticides has resulted in
      resistance in mosquitoes. Synthetic insecticides are toxic and affect the
      environment by contaminating soil, water, and air, and then natural products may 
      be an alternative to synthetic insecticides because they are effective,
      biodegradable, eco-friendly, and safe to environment. Botanical origin may serve 
      as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The present study
      was carried out to establish the larvicidal potential of leaf extracts of Gmelina
      asiatica and synthesized silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract against 
      late third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. Larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of plant extracts
      and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. The results were recorded from UV-visible
      spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron
      microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray
      spectroscopy analysis support the biosynthesis and characterization of AgNPs. The
      maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized AgNPs against the larvae of An.
      stephensi (lethal dose (LC(5)(0)) = 22.44 mug/mL; LC(9)(0) 40.65 mug/mL), Ae.
      aegypti (LC(5)(0) = 25.77 mug/mL; LC(9)(0) 45.98 mug/mL), and C. quinquefasciatus
      (LC(5)(0) = 27.83 mug/mL; LC(9)(0) 48.92 mug/mL), respectively. No mortality was 
      observed in the control. This is the first report on mosquito larvicidal activity
      of plant-synthesized nanoparticles. Thus, the use of G. asiatica to synthesize
      silver nanoparticles is a rapid, eco-friendly, and a single-step approach and the
      AgNps formed can be potential mosquito larvicidal agents.

AB  - With the growth of resistance to overused insecticides, vector management has
      become highly problematic. Hence more concentration has been focused on
      botanicals. Therefore our present study was aimed to evaluate the toxicity of
      compounds, aristolochic acid I and aristolochic acid II from the methanol extract
      of Aristolochia indica L. (Aristolochiaceae) leaves on larvae of Anopheles
      stephensi L. (Diptera: Culicidae) employing World Health Organization standard
      larvicide testing procedures. The soxhlet extraction was carried out using polar 
      solvent, methanol. The isolated toxic compounds were purified through RP-HPLC.
      The FTIR spectroscopic studies revealed different peak values with functional
      groups in the mixed compounds (AA-I and AA- II). These two aristolochic acids
      were further studied through (13)C and (1)HNMR analysis with confirmed by
      structures. Bioassay-guided fractionation through flash chromatography lead to
      the isolation of two larvicidal compounds namely aristolochic acid I and II. In
      these bioassays, the larvae were exposed to concentrations of 100, 250, 500,750
      and 1000 ppm for each compound. Between the two, AA-I exerted no significant
      toxicity difference (P < 0.05) on mosquito larvae with LC(5)(0)- 171.3, 209.8,
      269.1, 502.3 ppm and LC(9)(0)-751.6, 963.8, 972.7, 990.8 ppm compared to AA-II
      with LC(5)(0)-134.8, 166.7, 240.4,543.2 ppm and LC(9)(0)- 636.7, 792.5, 990.8,
      986.2 ppm against first, second, third and fourth instars, respectively. Further,
      the isolated compounds were severely affecting the mosquito gut. From the
      results, A. indica toxic compounds could be considered as one of the influential 
      applicant to bring about useful botanicals so as to prevent the resurrection of
      mosquito vectors.

TI  - Mosquitocidal and antibacterial activity of green-synthesized silver
      nanoparticles from Aloe vera extracts: towards an effective tool against the
      malaria vector Anopheles stephensi?
PG  - 1519-29
LID - 10.1007/s00436-015-4336-z [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes represent an important threat for lives of millions of people
      worldwide, acting as vectors for devastating pathogens, such as malaria, yellow
      fever, dengue, and West Nile. In addition, pathogens and parasites polluting
      water also constitute a severe plague for populations of developing countries.
      Here, we investigated the mosquitocidal and antibacterial properties of Aloe vera
      leaf extract and silver nanoparticles synthesized using A. vera extract.
      Mosquitocidal properties were assessed in laboratory against larvae (I-IV instar)
      and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. Green-synthesized silver
      nanoparticles were tested against An. stephensi also in field conditions.
      Antibacterial properties of nanoparticles were evaluated against Bacillus
      subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi using the agar disk
      diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration protocol. The synthesized silver
      nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction
      (XRD). In laboratory conditions, the A. vera extract was toxic against An.
      stephensi larvae and pupae, even at low dosages. LC50 were 48.79 ppm (I instar), 
      59.09 ppm (II instar), 70.88 ppm (III instar), 83.58 ppm (IV instar), and 152.55 
      ppm (pupae). Green-synthesized silver nanoparticles were highly toxic against An.
      stephensi. LC50 were 3.825 ppm (I instar), 4.119 ppm (II instar), 4.982 ppm (III 
      instar), 5.711 ppm (IV instar), and 6.113 ppm (pupae). In field conditions, the
      application of A. vera-synthesized silver nanoparticles (10 x LC50) leads to An. 
      stephensi larval reduction of 74.5, 86.6, and 97.7%, after 24, 48, and 72 h,
      respectively. Nanoparticles also showed antibacterial properties, and the maximum
      concentration tested (150 mg/L) evoked an inhibition zone wider than 80 mm in all
      tested bacterium species. This study adds knowledge about the use of green
      synthesis of nanoparticles in medical entomology and parasitology, allowing us to
      propose A. vera-synthesized silver nanoparticles as effective candidates to
      develop newer and safer mosquitocidal control tools.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides synthesized of natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (Ag
      NPs) were green-synthesized using a floral extract of Chrysanthemum indicum
      screened for larvicidal and pupicidal activity against the first to fourth instar
      larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The
      synthesized Ag NPs were characterized by using UV-vis absorption, X-ray
      diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray
      spectroscopy techniques. The textures of the yielded Ag NPs were found to be
      spherical and polydispersed with a mean size in the range of 25-59 nm. Larvae and
      pupae were exposed to various concentrations of aqueous extract of C. indicum and
      synthesized Ag NPs for 24 h, and the maximum mortality was observed from the
      synthesized Ag NPs against the vector A. stephensi (LC50 = 5.07, 10.35, 14.19,
      22.81, and 35.05 ppm; LC90 = 29.18, 47.15, 65.53, 87.96, and 115.05 ppm). These
      results suggest that the synthesized Ag NPs have the potential to be used as an
      ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of A. stephensi. Additionally, this
      study provides the larvicidal and pupicidal properties of green-synthesized Ag
      NPs with the floral extract of C. indicum against vector mosquito species from
      the geographical location of India.

AB  - In the present investigation, larvicidal potential of hexane, choloroform, ethyl 
      acetate, acetone, and methanol extracts of seven aromatic plants, viz., Blumea
      mollis, Chloroxylon swietenia, Clausena anisata, Feronia limnonia, Lantana
      camera, Plectranthus amboinicus, and Tagetes erecta were screened against Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi. The larval mortality
      was observed after 12 and 24 h of exposure period. The results revealed that all 
      the extracts showed varied levels of larvicidal activity against the mosquito
      species tested. However, the ethyl acetate extract of Chloroxylon swietenia
      showed the remarkable larvicidal activity against C. quinquefasciatus, Ae.
      aegypti, and An. stephensi. After 12 h of exposure period, the larvicidal
      activity was LC50 = 194.22 and LC90 = 458.83 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus), LC50 =
      173.04 and LC90 = 442.73 ppm (Ae. aegypti), and LC50 = 167.28 and LC90 = 433.07
      ppm (An. stephensi), and the larvicidal activity after 24-h exposure period was
      LC50 = 94.12 and LC90 = 249.83 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus), LC50 = 80.58 and LC90 =
      200.96 ppm (Ae. aegypti), and LC50 = 76.24 and LC90 = 194.51 ppm (An. stephensi).
      The larvicidal potential of other plant extracts were in order of ethyl acetate
      extract of Clausena anisata > methanol extract of P. amboinicus > acetone extract
      of F. limonia > methanol extract of T. erecta > methanol extract of B. mollis >
      and methanol extract of L. camera. The results of the present study offer a
      possible way for further investigations to find out the active molecule
      responsible for the activity.

TI  - Mosquito Larvicidal Potential of Gossypium hirsutum (Bt cotton) Leaves Extracts
      against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi larvae.
PG  - 91-101
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to extract the ingredients from leaves of Gossypium hirsutum
      (Bt cotton) using different solvents and evaluate for potential use to control
      different larval stages of mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles
      stephensi. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative estimation of ingredients from
      Go. hirsutum (Bt) plant extract was carried out and their inhibitory action
      against mosquito larvae was determined using mosquito larvicidal assay. RESULTS: 
      LC50 values of water, ethanol, ethyl acetate and hexane extracts for Ae. aegypti 
      were 211.73+/-21.49, 241.64+/-19.92, 358.07+/-32.43, 401.03+/-36.19 and
      232.56+/-26.00, 298.54+/-21.78, 366.50+/-30.59, 387.19+/-31.82 for 4(th) instar
      of An. stephensi, respectively. The water extract displayed lowest LC50 value
      followed by ethanol, ethyl acetate and hexane. Owing to the comparatively better 
      activity of water extract, its efficacy was further evaluated for mosquito
      larvicidal activity, which exhibited LC50 values of 133.95+/-12.79,
      167.65+/-11.34 against 2(nd) and 3(rd) instars of Ae. aegypti and 145.48+/-11.76,
      188.10+/-12.92 against 2(nd) and 3(rd) instars of An. stephensi, respectively.
      Crude protein from the water extract was precipitated using acetone and tested
      against 2(nd), 3(rd) and 4(th) instars of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi. It
      revealed further decrease in LC50 values as 105.72+/-25.84, 138.23+/-23.18,
      126.19+/-25.65, 134.04+/-04 and 137.88+/-17.59, 154.25+/-16.98 for 2(nd), 3(rd)
      and 4(th) instars of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Leaves extracts of Go. hirsutum (Bt) is potential mosquito larvicide and can be
      used as a potent alternative to chemical insecticides in integrated pest
      management.

TI  - Hypothesis: dynamics of classical malaria epidemics show Plasmodium falciparum's 
      survival strategy.
PG  - 561-4
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0541 [doi]
AB  - Areas of marginal transmission can generate enormous lethal falciparum malaria
      epidemics when factors favoring the parasite shift only slightly. Although
      usually described in terms of vectorial capacity, medical scientists working in
      India in the early 20th century came to the conclusion that "an epidemic of
      relapses" was the key triggering event of malaria epidemics. This explanation has
      been largely discarded, because the biology of Plasmodium falciparum
      recrudescence has since been differentiated from P. vivax relapse. Using data
      from the Punjab in 1908 and Ceylon in 1934-1935, the genesis of malaria epidemics
      has been re-examined to inform current control efforts. The epidemics were
      focused geographically depending on recent rainfall or drought. Epidemics arose
      very suddenly and simultaneously in several places. Malaria spleen surveys
      indicated very little recent malaria transmission, and blood smears showed very
      few gametocytes just before the epidemic. Population stress as indicated by high 
      grain prices because of a poor harvest caused by drought the previous year was a 
      risk factor for malaria epidemics. Although increased female Anopheline survival 
      because of increased humidity played an important part in the magnification of
      the epidemic, it does not explain its genesis. Human population stress triggering
      a shift toward gametocytogenesis is hypothesized as the key initiation factor for
      malaria epidemics. Its evolutionary significance may be that it allows the
      parasite to match the tropical agricultural cycle.

      malaria in an endemic district of Assam, India.
PG  - 25442
LID - 10.3402/iee.v5.25442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is perennial in the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh
      interstate border areas in the Sonitpur district of Assam, India. A yearlong
      study was carried out on the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria
      and the role of asymptomatic malaria carriers in persistent transmission of the
      disease. The relationships between malaria incidence and weather parameters were 
      also investigated. METHODS: Active and mass blood surveys were conducted on a
      monthly basis in Bengenajuli, Sapairaumari Pathar, and Nigam villages near the
      Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border. Epidemiological indices were estimated for
      malaria-positive cases. Multiple linear regression between monthly malaria
      incidence and monthly average temperature, and relative humidity along with
      monthly total rainfall was carried out. The known malaria vectors collected in
      CDC light traps were identified and recorded. RESULTS: Slide positivity rate
      (SPR) and Plasmodium falciparum percent (Pf%) for symptomatic malaria were 26.1
      and 79.8, respectively. Prevalence of malaria vectors was observed throughout the
      year with varying density. Anopheles philippinensis/nivipes and A. annularis were
      predominant among the seven known vector species recorded currently. Asymptomatic
      parasitemia was detected throughout the year with SPR ranging from 4.8 to 5.3.
      Monthly rainfall with 1-month lag had the highest correlation (r=0.92) with SPR. 
      The relationship between SPR and weather factors was established as
      SPR=-114.22+0.58 Tmin+1.38 RH+0.03 RF (R2=0.89; p=0.00). CONCLUSION: Low and
      relatively constant levels of asymptomatic parasitemia was present in the study
      area. High malaria vector density and presence of asymptomatic malaria parasite
      carriers were responsible for persistent malaria transmission in the region. This
      study concludes that passive detection and prompt treatment of asymptomatic
      carriers is essential for preventing persistent disease transmission. Rainfall
      along with some other weather variables may be used for predicting the malaria
      epidemics in the region. The predictive information could be useful to target
      resources more effectively.

TI  - Estimation of vectorial capacity of Anopheles minimus Theobald & An. fluviatilis 
      James (Diptera: Culicidae) in a malaria endemic area of Odisha State, India.
PG  - 653-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Anopheles minimus and An. fluviatilis were incriminated 
      as the major malaria vectors in Keonjhar district of Odisha State recently. This 
      study was carried out to elucidate the potential role of these two vector species
      in transmission of malaria during different seasons, and vectorial capacity of
      these species was also estimated. METHODS: Three hilly and forested villages of
      Keonjhar district were randomly selected. Vectorial capacity (C) was calculated
      using the Macdonald's formula as modified by Garret-Jones. The human landing
      density of the vector species was obtained from all night human landing
      collections (bait protected by bed-net). Man feeding habit was estimated by
      multiplying the human blood index with feeding frequency, which was obtained on
      daily basis from the duration of gonotrophic cycle. The probability of survival
      through the extrinsic incubation cycle was calculated from the probability of
      survival through one day and duration of sporogonic cycle. RESULTS: The estimated
      vectorial capacity of An. minimus varied between 0.014 and 1.09 for Plasmodium
      falciparum (Pf) and between 0.1 and 1.46 for P. vivax (Pv). The C of An. minimus 
      for both Pf and Pv was higher during rainy season than the other two seasons. The
      estimated C of An. fluviatilis varied between 0.04 and 1.28 for Pf and between
      0.20 and 1.54 for Pv. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Based on the estimated values
      of vectorial capacity of the two vector species, the area could be stratified and
      such stratification would reflect the difference in the intensity of transmission
      between different strata and accordingly the appropriate control strategy could
      be adopted for each stratum.

AB  - Recent advances in sequencing allow population-genomic data to be generated for
      virtually any species. However, approaches to analyse such data lag behind the
      ability to generate it, particularly in nonmodel species. Linkage disequilibrium 
      (LD, the nonrandom association of alleles from different loci) is a highly
      sensitive indicator of many evolutionary phenomena including chromosomal
      inversions, local adaptation and geographical structure. Here, we present linkage
      disequilibrium network analysis (LDna), which accesses information on LD shared
      between multiple loci genomewide. In LD networks, vertices represent loci, and
      connections between vertices represent the LD between them. We analysed such
      networks in two test cases: a new restriction-site-associated DNA sequence
      (RAD-seq) data set for Anopheles baimaii, a Southeast Asian malaria vector; and a
      well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set from 21
      three-spined stickleback individuals. In each case, we readily identified five
      distinct LD network clusters (single-outlier clusters, SOCs), each comprising
      many loci connected by high LD. In A. baimaii, further population-genetic
      analyses supported the inference that each SOC corresponds to a large inversion, 
      consistent with previous cytological studies. For sticklebacks, we inferred that 
      each SOC was associated with a distinct evolutionary phenomenon: two chromosomal 
      inversions, local adaptation, population-demographic history and geographic
      structure. LDna is thus a useful exploratory tool, able to give a global overview
      of LD associated with diverse evolutionary phenomena and identify loci
      potentially involved. LDna does not require a linkage map or reference genome, so
      it is applicable to any population-genomic data set, making it especially
      valuable for nonmodel species.

AB  - Variation in vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
      species is determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and life
      history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial capacity and explore new
      avenues for vector control, we sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito
      species from diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
      Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss, elevated gene
      shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron losses, relative to Drosophila.
      Some determinants of vectorial capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show 
      elevated turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes. This
      dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to their flexible
      capacity to take advantage of new ecological niches, including adapting to humans
      as primary hosts.

AB  - In prokaryotes, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been regarded as an important 
      evolutionary drive to acquire and retain beneficial genes for their survival in
      diverse ecologies. However, in eukaryotes, the functional role of HGTs remains
      questionable, although current genomic tools are providing increased evidence of 
      acquisition of novel traits within non-mating metazoan species. Here, we provide 
      another transcriptomic evidence for the acquisition of massive plant genes in the
      mosquito, Anopheles culicifacies. Our multiple experimental validations including
      genomic PCR, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, immuno-blotting and immuno-florescence
      microscopy, confirmed that plant like transcripts (PLTs) are of mosquito origin
      and may encode functional proteins. A comprehensive molecular analysis of the
      PLTs and ongoing metagenomic analysis of salivary microbiome provide initial
      clues that mosquitoes may have survival benefits through the acquisition of
      nuclear as well as chloroplast encoded plant genes. Our findings of PLTs further 
      support the similar questionable observation of HGTs in other higher organisms,
      which is still a controversial and debatable issue in the community of
      evolutionists. We believe future understanding of the underlying mechanism of the
      feeding associated molecular responses may shed new insights in the functional
      role of PLTs in the mosquito.

PG  - 341-8
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the larvicidal and repellent
      properties of marine Streptomyces sp. VITJS4 crude extracts. The marine soil
      samples were collected from the Puducherry coast, Tamil Nadu, India. The isolate 
      Streptomyces sp. VITJS4 was taxonomically characterized and identified. The ethyl
      acetate crude extract tested for larvicidal property showed 100% mortality for
      all the 3 species after 24 h exposure against the early fourth instar larvae of
      malarial vector--Anopheles stephensi at 50% and 90% lethal concentration (LC50 = 
      132.86, LC90 396.14 ppm); dengue vector--Aedes aegypti (LC50 = 112.78, LC90
      336.42 ppm) and filariasis vector--Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 156.53, LC90
      468.37 ppm). The Streptomyces sp. VITJS4 solvent extracts of hexane, ethyl
      acetate, benzene, chloroform and methanol were tested for repellent activity
      against A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. The ethyl acetate
      extract showed complete protection for 210 min at 6 mg/cm2 against these mosquito
      bites. The crude extract was analyzed further for Fourier Transform-infrared
      spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. In addition to the importance of bioactive
      compounds, the utilization of Streptomyces sp. VITJS4 crude extracts revealed
      effective larvicidal and repellent activity against the vectors, which perhaps
      represents a promising tool in the management of mosquito control.

AB  - Microbial synthesis of nanoparticles is a green approach that interconnects
      nanotechnology and microbial biotechnology. Here, we synthesized the silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) using bacterial strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus
      subtilius and Streptomyces anulatus. We tested the efficacy of AgNPs against the 
      larvae, pupae and adults of Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. We
      have also investigated the antifungal activity of AgNPs against the soil
      keratinophilic fungus of Chrysosporium keratinophilum. The efficacy tests were
      then performed at different concentrations and varying numbers of hours by probit
      analysis. The results were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer, and the
      images were recorded with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The
      synthesized AgNPs were in varied shape and sizes. The larvae and pupae of Cx.
      quinquefasciatus were found highly susceptible to AgNPs synthesized using the L. 
      monocytogenes, B. subtilius and S. anulatus than the An. stephensi, while the
      adults of An. stephensi were found more susceptible to the AgNPs synthesized
      using the L. monocytogenes, B. subtilius and S. anulatus the Cx.
      quinquefasciatus. Further, these nanoparticles have also been tested as
      antifungal activity against the entomopathogenic fungus C. keratinophilum. The
      higher zone of inhibition occurred at the concentration level of 50 mul. This
      study gives an innovative approach to develop eco-friendly AgNPs which act as an 
      effective antifungal agent/fungicide and insecticide.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. Mosquito control is to enhance the health and quality of life of county
      residents and visitors through the reduction of mosquito populations. Mosquito
      control is a serious concern in developing countries like India due to the lack
      of general awareness, development of resistance, and socioeconomic reasons.
      Today, nanotechnology is a promising research domain which has a wide ranging
      application in vector control programs. These are nontoxic, easily available at
      affordable prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific
      activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. In the present study, 
      larvicidal activity of aqueous leaf extract and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
      synthesized using C. asiatica plant leaves against late third instar larvae of
      Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The range of
      varying concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mug/mL) and
      aqueous leaf extract (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mug/mL) were tested against the
      larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The synthesized
      AgNPs from C. asiatica were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in three
      important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV-Vis
      spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, 
      and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDX). Considerable mortality
      was evident after the treatment of C. asiatica for all three important vector
      mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of C. asiatica aqueous leaf extract appeared
      to be effective against An. stephensi (LC50, 90.17 mug/mL; LC90, 165.18 mug/mL)
      followed by Ae. aegypti (LC50, 96.59 mug/mL; LC90, 173.83 mug/mL) and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus (LC50, 103.08 mug/mL; LC90, 183.16 mug/mL). Synthesized AgNPs
      against the vector mosquitoes of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90 values: An. stephensi had LC50
      and LC90 values of 17.95 and 33.03 mug/mL; Ae. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values
      of 19.32 and 34.87 mug/mL; and Cx. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of
      20.92 and 37.41 mug/mL. No mortality was observed in the control. These results
      suggest that the leaf aqueous extracts of C. asiatica and green synthesis of
      silver nanoparticles have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly
      approach for the control of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus.
      This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the plant
      extracts and synthesized AgNPs.

TI  - Effect of house spraying with lambdacyhalothrin 10 per cent capsule suspension
      (CS) formulation in comparison with 10 per cent wettable powder (WP) against
      malaria vector in Malkangiri district, Odisha, India.
PG  - 538-45
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Selection of an insecticide and its appropriate
      formulation is a prerequisite of formulating any chemical control strategy
      against vectors. A hut scale field trial was carried out to study the
      effectiveness of house spraying with capsule suspension (CS) formulation of
      lambdacyhalothrin in comparison with its wettable powder (WP) formulation on
      mortality, density and behaviour of malaria vector in Malkangiri district,
      Odisha, India. METHODS: The two formulations were tested at 20 and 30 mg (a.i.)/m
      2 for their effectiveness in terms of deterrence, excito-repellency,
      blood-feeding success, mortality and residual activity against Anopheles
      fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, in experimental huts in Malkangiri
      district, Odisha State, India. RESULTS: Both CS and WP formulations prevented the
      entry of An. fluviatilis in to the sprayed huts by >90 per cent for >6 months,
      the entire peak malaria transmission season in the area. The exit rate increased 
      (90-99%) with different treatments and the feeding rate was reduced (91-97%).
      There was no significant difference between WP 30, CS 20 and CS 30 mg/m 2 in
      these respects. However, WP 20 mg/m 2 caused a lesser effect than the other three
      groups. The formulations or the dosages differed only in causing vector
      mortalities. Overall, the total mortality rate of An. fluviatilis was higher in
      the huts sprayed with CS 30 (58%) than the huts sprayed with CS 20 (48%), WP 20
      (37%) and WP 30 mg/m 2 (47%). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Considering the
      duration of residual action and the effect on entry, exit, feeding and mortality 
      of An. fluviatilis, the dosage 20 mg/m 2 of CS formulation of lambdacyhalothrin
      could be considered for further use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To depict mitochondrial genetic variation for the first time among
      Anopheles minimus (An.minimus) (Diptera: Culicidae) species from two malaria
      endemic states of NE India. METHODS: Phylogeographic analysis was carried at 9
      out of 12 sites of An.minimus confirmed malaria endemic places. RESULTS: All
      sequences were Adenine-Thymine rich regions. Transitions were observed in 6
      sequences where 5 mutations were synonymous substitutions and in 1 case non
      synonymous mutation was observed. Three distinct clusters of haplotypes were
      generated. Haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity were studied. Overall
      negative values obtained from Tajima's D test and Fu'sFS test indicate a recent
      genetic population expansion. Network analysis has explained sequence diversity
      that was also shown by mutations in 6 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: High genetic
      diversity observed within the populations of An.minimus species has several
      possible implications for vector control in the region.

AB  - Ookinete invasion of Anopheles midgut is a critical step for malaria
      transmission; the parasite numbers drop drastically and practically reach a
      minimum during the parasite's whole life cycle. At this stage, the parasite as
      well as the vector undergoes immense oxidative stress. Thereafter, the vector
      undergoes oxidative stress at different time points as the parasite invades its
      tissues during the parasite development. The present study was undertaken to
      reconstruct the network of differentially expressed genes involved in oxidative
      stress in Anopheles stephensi during Plasmodium development and maturation in the
      midgut. Using high throughput next generation sequencing methods, we generated
      the transcriptome of the An. stephensi midgut during Plasmodium vinckei petteri
      oocyst invasion of the midgut epithelium. Further, we utilized large datasets
      available on public domain on Anopheles during Plasmodium ookinete invasion and
      Drosophila datasets and arrived upon clusters of genes that may play a role in
      oxidative stress. Finally, we used support vector machines for the functional
      prediction of the un-annotated genes of An. stephensi. Integrating the results
      from all the different data analyses, we identified a total of 516 genes that
      were involved in oxidative stress in An. stephensi during Plasmodium development.
      The significantly regulated genes were further extracted from this gene cluster
      and used to infer an oxidative stress network of An. stephensi. Using system
      biology approaches, we have been able to ascertain the role of several putative
      genes in An. stephensi with respect to oxidative stress. Further experimental
      validations of these genes are underway.

      nanoparticles using Mangifera indica extract against blood-feeding parasites.
PG  - 571-81

AB  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are considered to be among the best
      photocatalytic materials due to their long-term thermodynamic stability, strong
      oxidizing power, and relative non-toxicity. Nano-preparations with TiO2 NPs are
      currently under investigation as novel treatments for acne vulgaris, recurrent
      condyloma acuminata, atopic dermatitis, hyperpigmented skin lesions, and other
      non-dermatologic diseases. The present study was to investigate the acaricidal
      and larvicidal activity of synthesized TiO2 NPs utilizing leaf aqueous extract of
      Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae) against hematophagous parasites. The
      anti-parasitic activity of TiO2 NPs against the larvae of Rhipicephalus
      (Boophilus) microplus, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum and Haemaphysalis bispinosa
      (Acari: Ixodidae), fourth instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) were assessed. The green synthesized TiO2
      NPs were analyzed by UV-Vis, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), AFM, SEM, and TEM.
      The XRD analysis of synthesized TiO2 NPs revealed the dominant peak at 2theta
      value of 27.81 which matched the 110 crystallographic plane of the rutile
      structure indicating the crystal structure. The FTIR spectra exhibited a
      prominent peak at 3,448 cm(-1) and showed OH stretching due to the alcoholic
      group, and the OH group may act as a capping agent. The SEM images of TiO2 NPs
      displayed spherical, oval in shape, individual, and some in aggregates.
      Characterization of the synthesized TiO2 NPs using AFM offered three-dimensional 
      visualization and uneven surface morphology. The TEM micrograph showed
      agglomerates, round and slight elongation with an average size of 30 +/- 5 nm.
      The maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized TiO2 NPs against the larvae of
      R. microplus, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, Haemaphysalis bispinosa, A.
      subpictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus with LC50 value of 28.56, 33.17, 23.81,
      5.84, and 4.34 mg/L, respectively. In the present study, a novel, simple, and
      eco-friendly approach has been suggested to control blood-feeding parasites.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases have an economic impact, including loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates; 
      however, no part of the world is free from vector-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are 
      the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, arboviral
      encephalitis, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever.
      These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and
      livestock around the world. In view of the recently increased interest in
      developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticides, 
      in the present study, the repellent activity of crude hexane, ethyl acetate,
      benzene, chloroform, and methanol extracts of leaf of Erythrina indica and root
      of Asparagus racemosus were assayed for their repellency against three important 
      vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
      quinquefasciatus. The crude extract was applied on a membrane used for membrane
      feeding of unfed mosquitoes in a 1-ft cage. About 50 unfed 3-4-day-old
      laboratory-reared pathogen-free strains of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C.
      quinquefasciatus were introduced in a 1-ft cage fitted with a membrane with blood
      for feeding with temperature maintained at 37 degrees C through circulating water
      bath maintained at 40-45 degrees C. Three concentrations (1.0, 2.0, and 5.0
      mg/cm(2)) of the crude extracts were evaluated. Repellents in E. indica afforded 
      longer protection time against A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus 
      than those in A. racemosus at 5.0 mg/cm(2) concentration, and the mean complete
      protection time ranged from 120 to 210 min with the different extracts tested. In
      this observation, these two plant crude extracts gave protection against mosquito
      bites; also, the repellent activity is dependent on the strength of the plant
      extracts. These results suggest that the leaf extract of E. indica and root
      extract of A. racemosus have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly
      approach for the control of mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito 
      repellent activity of the reported A. racemosus and E. indica plants.

TI  - Genotyping of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum in wild caught
      Anopheles minimus mosquitoes in a malaria endemic area of Assam, India.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - We validated the feasibility of using Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria
      parasite, DNA present in wild caught vector mosquitoes for the characterization
      of chloroquine resistance status. House frequenting mosquitoes belonging to
      Anopheles minimus complex were collected from human dwellings in a malaria
      endemic area of Assam, Northeast India and DNA was extracted from the head-thorax
      region of individual mosquitoes. Anopheles minimus complex mosquitoes were
      identified to species level and screened for the presence of Plasmodium sp. using
      molecular tools. Nested PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping of P. falciparum 
      based on K76T mutation in the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene.
      Three of the 27 wild caught An. minimus mosquitoes were harbouring P. falciparum 
      sporozoites (positivity 11.1%) and all 3 were had 76T mutation in the pfcrt gene,
      indicating chloroquine resistance. The approach of characterizing antimalarial
      resistance of malaria parasite in vector mosquitoes can potentially be used as a 
      surveillance tool for monitoring transmission of antimalarial drug resistant
      parasite strains in the community.

TI  - Development of a novel malarial vaccine design: a hypothetical approach.
PG  - 239-42
AB  - P. falciparum is highly virulent in nature because of its ability to modify the
      infected host red blood cells, adherence to the vascular endothelium and changes 
      in antigenicity at different stages. Also slow migration time in the dermal and
      endothelial cells leads to decreased immune response. To overcome the problems,
      there is a need to design a vaccine which increases the migration time of the
      parasite, enhances the immune response, enables recognition of surface antigens
      and causes minimal clinical infection as a side-effect. An ITI-based
      (Infection-Treatment Immunization) vaccine development strategy is to be adopted 
      to develop this novel vaccine. This will include administration of a liquid
      solution of purified, non-attenuated sporozoites from an infected female
      Anopheles mosquito, AS02A adjuvant and chlorate (a metabolic inhibitor of
      sulfation that decreases the extent of GAG sulfation). To control infection, a
      drug-cover of artemisinin will be administered as a part of the vaccination
      strategy along with a specific protease inhibitor MRT12113 which prevents RBC
      rupture and reinvasion by the parasite. This vaccine will intend to increase the 
      overall migration time of the parasite in blood which is otherwise approximately 
      30 minutes, resulting in an overall enhanced immune response. It also intends to 
      reduce parasite invasion in cells and their consequent rupture thus preventing
      the clinical condition-malaria.

LID - 97 [pii]
AB  - Anopheles subpictus Grassi s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) functions as a secondary
      malaria vector to Anopheles culicifacies Giles s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) in Sri
      Lanka. The taxon A. subpictus is reported to exist as a species complex
      comprising four sibling species (A-D) that can be differentiated through polytene
      chromosome banding patterns and stage-specific morphometric traits in India.
      Based on the morphological characteristics described for the Indian Subpictus
      Complex, the presence of all four sibling species has been described in Sri
      Lanka. As sibling species show distinct bio-ecological characteristics that are
      important for devising appropriate vector control measures, a study was carried
      out in six districts in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The results confirm the
      presence of all four sibling species, with species C predominating in inland
      areas and species B in coastal areas. Species C and D were indoor-resting and
      indoor-feeding, while species B was outdoor-resting with no significant
      preference for indoor- or outdoor-resting. Species B showed distinct
      morphological variation in the ornamentation of wings and palpi. Blood meal
      analysis revealed that species B, C, and D can feed on humans as well as cattle. 
      The differential bio-ecological traits shown by the members of the Subpictus
      Complex are important for developing appropriate vector control measures in Sri
      Lanka.

TI  - Mosquitocidal Bacillus amyloliquefaciens: dynamics of growth & production of
      novel pupicidal biosurfactant.
PG  - 427-34
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (VCRC B483)
      producing mosquito larvicidal and pupicidal biosurfactant was isolated from
      mangrove forest soil. The present study was aimed at studying the kinetics of
      growth and production of the mosquitocidal biosurfactant by this bacterium.
      METHODS: Dynamics of growth, sporulation and production of mosquitocidal
      biosurfactant were studied by standard microbiological methods. The mosquitocidal
      biosurfactant was precipitated from the culture supernatant and bioassayed
      against immature stages of mosquito vectors to determine lethal dose and lethal
      time. The activity, biological and biochemical properties of the biosurfactant
      have also been studied. RESULTS: The pupal stages of mosquitoes were found to be 
      more vulnerable to the biosurfactant produced by this bacterium with Anopheles
      stephensi being the most vulnerable species. The median lethal time (LT 50 ) was 
      found to be 1.23 h when the pupal stages of the above species were exposed to
      lethal concentration LC 90 (9 microg/ml) dosage of the biosurfactant. Production 
      of biosurfactant was found to increase with incubation time and maximum biomass, 
      maximum quantity of biosurfactant (7.9 mg/ml), maximum biosurfactant activity (6 
      kBS unit/mg) and maximum mosquitocidal activity (5 microg/ml) were attained by 72
      h of growth. The lipopeptide nature of the biosurfactant was confirmed by
      beta-haemolysis, lipase activity, biofilm forming capacity, thermostability and
      biochemical analysis. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The mosquitocidal
      biosurfactant produced by B. amyloliquefaciens (VCRC B483) may be a prospective
      alternative molecule for use in mosquito control programmes involving bacterial
      biopesticides.

AB  - The genetic differentiation in A. stephensi based on haplotype diversity using
      Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and bysequencing of CO II gene across
      different localities in India has been analyzed. The presence of only one DraI
      restriction site in CO II gene conferred to haplotype B indicating that the gene 
      is very much conserved and the gene flow is not affected even by a major
      geographical distance barrier. The sequencing and analysisof various population
      parameters revealed seven haplotypes in all populations. The West Bengal
      population was found to be more genetically diverse than others. The geographic
      distance between populations was found to be contributing to the genetic
      differentiation. The sign of demographic expansion were found in three of the
      five populations. The local geographic barriers were found to be ineffective in
      prevention of gene flow.

AB  - Applications based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are limited by low
      temperatures, which cause aggregation of the nanoparticle fraction, leading to
      reduced efficacy of their products. We aimed at studying AgNP synthesis by
      psychrotolerant bacteria, its stability under long-term storage, and larvicidal
      activity under low-temperature conditions. Electron and atomic force microscopy
      studies revealed that 6 among 22 psychrotolerant isolates synthesized AgNPs with 
      an average diameter of 1.9-14.1 nm. Pseudomonas mandelii SR1 synthesized the
      least-sized AgNPs with an average diameter of 1.9-10 nm, at temperatures as low
      as 12 degrees C without aggregate formation, and the synthesized nanoparticles
      were stable for up to 19 months of storage period. On studying their larvicidal
      activity, LC90 (lethal concentration) values against Anopheles subpictus and
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus larvae were at 31.7 and 35.6 mg/L, respectively. Stable
      non-aggregate AgNPs at low-temperature conditions from P. mandelii SR1, coupled
      with their larvicidal property, can be applied to control larval populations in
      water bodies located in seasonal or permanently cold environments.

      developing countries with tropical and subtropical climates. The aim of the
      present study is to evaluate the adulticidal and smoke toxicity of Cipadessa
      baccifera (Roth) against three important mosquitoes vectors, Anopheles stephensi,
      Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). Adult mortality
      was observed after 24-h recovery period. The plant crude extracts showed
      dose-dependent mortality. At higher concentrations, the adult showed restless
      movement for some times with abnormal wagging and then died. Among the extracts
      tested, the highest adulticidal activity was observed in acetone extract against 
      An. stephensi followed by Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus with the LD50 and 
      LD90 values 16.021 (14.080-18.345), 29.095 (25.118-34.089); 23.581
      (22.100-28.315), 38.636 (35.321-41.021); and 13.560 (9.479-17.391), 248.35
      (203.47-344.43) mg/ml, respectively. No mortality was recorded in the control.
      Smoke toxicity was observed at 10-min interval for 40 min and the mortality data 
      were recorded. Among the C. baccifera plant powder tested. Smoke toxicity results
      show that Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi, and Ae. aegypti shows 88.6 +/-
      1.8, 78.2 +/- 0.5, and 77 +/- 1, respectively. One hundred percent mortality was 
      recorded in the commercial mosquito control. The present study shows that C.
      baccifera leaf powder can be used as an efficient toxicity against mosquitoes.
      These results suggest that the leaf extracts of C. baccifera have a potential to 
      be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquitoes.

AB  - Rubiaceae and Apocynaceae families are well known for the expression of
      cyclotides having insecticidal properties. Leaves and flowers extracts of plants 
      from the families Rubiaceae (Ixora coccinea) and Apocynaceae (Allamanda violacea)
      were evaluated for mosquito larvicidal effect against early IVth instars of Aedes
      aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. Two forms of plant extracts, one untreated and
      the other treated with heat and proteolytic enzyme were used for assay. After
      primary assay, the extract showing more than 50% inhibition was further used for 
      quantification purpose. LC50 and LC90 values of all the extracts were found to be
      reduced with the treated form. Phytochemical analysis of plant extracts was
      performed. Primary confirmation for the presence of cyclotides was done by Lowry 
      test, thin layer chromatography and haemolytic assay. This novel approach merits 
      use of plant extracts in mosquito control programmes.

AB  - Diseases transmitted by blood-feeding mosquitoes, such as dengue fever, dengue
      hemorrhagic fever, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, and filariasis, are increasing
      in prevalence, particularly in tropical and subtropical zones. To control
      mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases, which have worldwide health and economic 
      impacts, synthetic insecticide-based interventions are still necessary,
      particularly in situations of epidemic outbreak and sudden increases of adult
      mosquitoes. Green nanoparticle synthesis has been achieved using environmentally 
      acceptable plant extract and eco-friendly reducing and capping agents. In view of
      the recently increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an
      alternative to chemical insecticide, in the present study, the adulticidal
      activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Heliotropium indicum
      plant leaf extract against adults of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus was determined. Adult mosquitoes were exposed to varying
      concentrations of aqueous extract of H. indicum and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h.
      AgNPs were rapidly synthesized using the leaf extract of H. indicum, and the
      formation of nanoparticles was observed within 6 h. The results recorded from
      UV-vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
      microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy support the biosynthesis and
      characterization of AgNPs. The maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized AgNPs
      against the adult of A. stephensi (lethal dose (LD)(5)(0) = 26.712 mug/mL;
      LD(9)(0) = 49.061 mug/mL), A. aegypti (LD(5)(0) = 29.626 mug/mL; LD(9)(0) =
      54.269 mug/mL), and C. quinquefasciatus (LD(5)(0) = 32.077 mug/mL; LD(9)(0) =
      58.426 mug/mL), respectively. No mortality was observed in the control. These
      results suggest that the leaf aqueous extracts of H.indicum and green synthesis
      of AgNPs have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of the A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. This is the
      first report on the adulticidal activity of the plant extracts and AgNPs.

TI  - Environmental management through sluice gated bed-dam: a revived strategy for the
      control of Anopheles fluviatilis breeding in streams.
PG  - 296-301
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Integrated vector management (IVM) emphasizes
      sustainable eco-friendly methods and minimal use of chemicals. In this context,
      the present study highlights the environmental control of breeding of Anopheles
      fluviatilis, the primary malaria vector, through water management in a natural
      stream in Koraput district, Odisha, India. METHODS: The District Rural
      Development Agency (DRDA), Koraput, constructed two bed-dams across streams, one 
      in Barigaon and the other in Pipalapodar village. The bed-dam in the former
      village was fitted with two sluice gates whereas the bed dam constructed in the
      latter village was without the sluice gate. the sluice gates were opened once in 
      a week on a fixed day to flush out the water from the dam. Anopheles immatures
      were sampled systematically in the streams using a dipper for density measurement
      and species composition. RESULTS: There was a reduction of 84.9 per cent in the
      proportion of positive dips for anopheles larvae/pupae and a reduction of 98.4
      per cent in immature density (number/dip) of An. fluviatilis in the experimental 
      downstream compared to the control following opening of the sluice gates.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findins showed that opening of sluice gates of 
      the bed-dam regularly once in a week resulted in the control of vector breeding
      in the downstream due to the flushing effect of the water released with a high
      flow from the bed-dam that stagnated water in the upstream. The outcome of the
      study encourages upscaling this measure to other areas, wherever feasible.

AB  - In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles were biologically synthesized using the
      leaf extract of Plectranthus amboinicus (Pam-ZnO NPs). The synthesized Pam-ZnO
      NPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, FTIR, TEM and XRD analysis.
      TEM analysis of Pam-ZnO NPs showed the average size of about 20-50 nm. Pam-ZnO
      NPs control the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms
      (MRSA ATCC 33591) at the concentration of 8-10 mug/ml. Confocal laser scanning
      microscope (CLSM) images revealed that Pam-ZnO NPs strongly inhibited the biofilm
      forming ability of S. aureus. In addition, Pam-ZnO NPs showed 100% mortality of
      fourth instar mosquito larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and 
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus at the concentration of 8 and 10 mug/ml. The
      histopathological studies of Pam-ZnO NPs treated A. stephensi and C.
      quinquefasciatus larvae revealed the presence of damaged cells and tissues in the
      mid-gut. The damaged tissues suffered major changes including rupture and
      disintegration of epithelial layer and cellular vacuolization. The present study 
      conclude that Pam-ZnO NPs showed effective control of S. aureus biofilms and
      mosquito larvae by damaging the mid gut cells.

AB  - DDT has enjoyed the reputation of a successful pesticide in disease control
      programme and agricultural practices along with the serious opposition and ban
      later on due to its biomagnification and toxic action against non-target
      organisms. The present work was carried out to develop QSAR models for analysing 
      DDT analogues for their pesticidal activity and in silico validation of these
      models. A 2D-QSAR model was generated using stepwise with multiple regression,
      and the model with a value of r(2) = 0.7324; q(2) = 0.6215; pred r(2) = 0.7038,
      containing five descriptors, was selected for further study. The 3D QSAR with
      CoMFA analysis showed that steric contribution of 21% and electrostatic
      contribution of about 79% were required for larvicidal activity of DDT analogues.
      A set of 3430 molecules was generated using the basic DDT skeleton as template,
      and these were evaluated for their mosquito larvicidal activity using the
      generated QSAR models and DDT as standard. Eleven molecules were selected for in 
      silico validation of these models. For this, a docking study of the selected
      molecules against the homology-modelled voltage-gated sodium channel of Anopheles
      funestus was conducted. The study showed that the activities of these analogues
      as predicted by 2D-QSAR, 3D-QSAR with CoMFA and dock score were observed to be
      well correlated.

AB  - Utilization of multiple putatively neutral DNA markers for inferring evolutionary
      history of species population is considered to be the most robust approach.
      Molecular population genetic studies have been conducted in many species of
      Anopheles genus, but studies based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
      are still very scarce. Anopheles minimus is one of the principal malaria vectors 
      of Southeast (SE) Asia including the Northeastern (NE) India. Although population
      genetic studies with mitochondrial genetic variation data have been utilized to
      infer phylogeography of the SE Asian populations of this species, limited
      information on the population structure and demography of Indian An. minimus is
      available. We herewith have developed multilocus nuclear genetic approach with
      SNP markers located in X chromosome of An. minimus in eight Indian and two SE
      Asian population samples (121 individual mosquitoes in total) to infer population
      history and test several hypotheses on the phylogeography of this species. While 
      the Thai population sample of An. minimus presented the highest nucleotide
      diversity, majority of the Indian samples were also fairly diverse. In general,
      An. minimus populations were moderately substructured in the distribution range
      covering SE Asia and NE India, largely falling under three distinct genetic
      clusters. Moreover, demographic expansion events could be detected in the
      majority of the presently studied populations of An. minimus. Additional DNA

      individual mosquitoes) corroborated the existing hypothesis of Indian An. minimus
      falling under the earlier reported mitochondrial lineage B.

TI  - A note on the insecticide susceptibility status of principal malaria vector
      Anopheles culicifacies in four states of India.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The major malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies Giles
      is reported to contribute ~ 65% of the malaria cases in India. This species
      developed resistance to DDT and later to HCH, malathion and also to pyrethroids
      in some states due to their use in the national malaria control programme. In the
      present study, insecticide susceptibility of this species was monitored in four
      states of India. METHODS: To determine insecticide susceptibility status of the
      major malaria vector An. culicifacies, adult mosquitoes were collected from
      different localities of 32 tribal districts in the states of Andhra Pradesh,
      Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal during October/November 2009-10. Mosquitoes
      were collected from stratified ecotypes comprising a group of districts in West
      Bengal and individual districts in three other states. Mosquitoes were exposed to
      papers treated with WHO diagnostic dose: 4% DDT, 5% malathion and 0.05%
      deltamethrin following the WHO tube method. RESULTS: RESULTS provided the
      susceptibility status of An. culicifacies to different insecticides used in the
      public health programme in 32 districts in four states. An. culicifacies was
      found resistant to DDT (mortality range 0-36%) in all the 32 districts; to
      malathion it was resistant in 14 districts, verification required in 10 districts
      and susceptible in eight districts (mortality range 32.2-100%). It was resistant 
      to deltamethrin in four districts, verification required in 11 districts and
      susceptible in 17 districts (mortality range 43.3-100%). INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: Development of widespread resistance to insecticides used in public
      health sprays for vector control including to pyrethroids in An. culicifacies in 
      the surveyed districts is of great concern for the malaria control programme as
      the major interventions for vector control are heavily reliant on chemical
      insecticides, mainly synthetic pyrethroids used both for indoor residual spraying
      and for long-lasting insecticidal nets. Thus, there is a need to periodically
      monitor and update the susceptibility status of malaria vector(s) to suggest
      alternative vector control strategies for effective disease management.

TI  - Impact of deforestation on known malaria vectors in Sonitpur district of Assam,
      India.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: An alarming rate of deforestation has been reported from
      Sonitpur district of Assam, India therefore, a study was initiated during 2009
      using remote sensing (RS) to assess deforested areas in the district and to study
      the impact on malaria vectors in order to formulate appropriate control strategy.
      METHODS: RS imageries of 2000 and 2009 were used to assess deforested areas in
      the selected district. Entomological data were collected in four surveys during
      2009-2011. The data were analyzed statistically using test of single proportions 
      (chi 2 ) and pair-wise comparison. Vector incrimination was done using
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and entomological inoculation rate
      (EIR) was calculated to estimate transmission intensity. RESULTS: The deforested 
      areas were identified in north-western parts of Sonitpur district falling in
      Dhekiajuli Primary Health Centre (PHC). The forest cover of the PHC decreased
      >50% during 2000-2009. Five species of anopheline vectors were collected.
      Anopheles minimus sensu lato (s.l.) was collected least abundantly while An.
      culicifacies s.l. prevailed most abundantly and significant difference was
      observed between proportions of the collected vector species. Pair-wise
      comparison between An. culicifacies s.l. and An. minimus s.l. was also found
      statistically significant indicating that An. culicifacies s.l. is establishing
      its population in deforested areas. An. culicifacies s.l. was found ELISA
      positive and EIR was measured as 4.8 during transmission season. CONCLUSION: An. 
      culicifacies s.l. replaced An. minimus s.l., the vector of malaria in northeast
      India and was found ELISA positive, therefore could have possible role in malaria
      transmission in the deforested areas of the district.

AB  - Here, we have used the green method for synthesis of silver and gold
      nanoparticles. In the present study the silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles
      (NPs) were synthesized by using the aqueous bark extract of Indian spice dalchini
      (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) (C. zyelanicum or C. verum J. Presl). Additionally, we
      have used these synthesized nanoparticles for mosquito control. The larvicidal
      activity has been tested against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and
      filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The results were obtained using
      UV-visible spectrophotometer and the images were recorded with a transmission
      electron microscope (TEM). The efficacy tests were then performed at different
      concentrations and varying numbers of hours by probit analysis. The synthesized
      AgNPs were in spherical shape and average sizes (11.77 nm AgNPs and 46.48 nm
      AuNPs). The larvae of An. stephensi were found highly susceptible to the
      synthesized AgNPs and AuNPs than the Cx. quinquefasciatus. These results suggest 
      that the C. zeylanicum synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles have the
      potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of
      mosquito.

PG  - 97
LID - 10.1673/031.014.97 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles subpictus Grassi s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) functions as a secondary
      malaria vector to Anopheles culicifacies Giles s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) in Sri
      Lanka. The taxon A. subpictus is reported to exist as a species complex
      comprising four sibling species (A-D) that can be differentiated through polytene
      chromosome banding patterns and stage-specific morphometric traits in India.
      Based on the morphological characteristics described for the Indian Subpictus
      Complex, the presence of all four sibling species has been described in Sri
      Lanka. As sibling species show distinct bio-ecological characteristics that are
      important for devising appropriate vector control measures, a study was carried
      out in six districts in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The results confirm the
      presence of all four sibling species, with species C predominating in inland
      areas and species B in coastal areas. Species C and D were indoor-resting and
      indoor-feeding, while species B was outdoor-resting with no significant
      preference for indoor- or outdoor-resting. Species B showed distinct
      morphological variation in the ornamentation of wings and palpi. Blood meal
      analysis revealed that species B, C, and D can feed on humans as well as cattle. 
      The differential bio-ecological traits shown by the members of the Subpictus
      Complex are important for developing appropriate vector control measures in Sri
      Lanka.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of Ethiopian ethnomedicinal plant Juniperus procera essential
      oil against Afrotropical malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera:
      Culicidae).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the essential oil of Juniperus procera (J. procera)
      (Cupressaceae) for larvicidal activity against late third instar larvae of
      Anopheles arabiensis (An. arabiensis) Patton, the principle malaria vector in
      Ethiopia. METHODS: The essential oil of J. procera was evaluated against the
      larvae of An. arabiensis under the laboratory and semi-field conditions by
      adopting the World Health Organization standard protocols. The larval mortality
      was observed for 24 h of post exposure. RESULTS: The essential oil of J. procera 
      has demonstrated varying degrees of larvicidal activity against An. arabiensis.
      The LC50 and LC90 values of J. procera were 14.42 and 24.65 mg/L, respectively
      under the laboratory conditions, and from this data, a Chi-square value 6.662 was
      observed to be significant at the P=0.05 level. However, under the semi-field
      conditions the LC50 and LC90 values of J. procera were 24.51 and 34.21 mg/L,
      respectively and a Chi-square value 4.615 was significant at the P=0.05 level.
      The observations clearly showed that larval mortality rate is completely time and
      dose-dependent as compared with the control. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation
      indicates that J. procera could serve as a potential larvicidal agent against
      insect vector of diseases, particularly An. arabiensis. However further studies
      are strongly recommended for the identification of the chemical constituents and 
      the mode of action towards the rational design of alternative promising
      insecticidal agents in the near future.

AB  - Recent epidemiological evidences revealed a higher rate of O blood group in the
      residents of malaria-endemic areas suggesting that groups A, B, and AB associated
      with a higher disease severity and fatality. Also recent data showed the low
      prevalence of AB group within the malaria-endemic residents in south of Iran and 
      India. The aim of this study was to determine the ABO blood groups preference of 
      Anopheles stephensi which is the main malaria vector in Iran, southwest Asia, and
      India. An. stephensi mosquitoes were fed either artificially on A/B/O/AB membrane
      blood feeders or directly on human volunteer hands and forearms of A/B/O/AB
      groups in a cage under lab conditions. Phenotype and genotype analyzes of
      450-blood-fed mosquito specimens using agglutination and
      multiplex-allele-specific PCR revealed a significant blood preference of An.
      stephensi to AB group (40%) than other groups of A (24%), B (21%), and O (15%) in
      combination of both experiments. High preference of An. stephensi to AB group
      might increase malaria infection and fatality in this blood group and resulted in
      low frequency of AB group in the residents of malaria endemic areas. The data
      suggested that malaria vectors, like parasites may have selection pressure on
      human genotypes.

      mosquitoes.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases with an economic impact create loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates. 
      Mosquito control is facing a threat because of the emergence of resistance to
      synthetic insecticides. Extracts from plants may be alternative sources of
      mosquito control agents because they constitute a rich source of bioactive
      compounds that are biodegradable into nontoxic products and potentially suitable 
      for use to control mosquitoes. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
      suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. In view of the recently
      increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to
      chemical insecticide, in the present study, the adulticidal activity of silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Feronia elephantum plant leaf extract
      against adults of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus 
      was determined. The range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (8, 16, 24, 32, 
      and 40 mug mL(-1)) and aqueous leaf extract (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mug
      mL(-1)) were tested against the adults of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C.
      quinquefasciatus. Adults were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous crude 
      extract and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. Considerable mortality was evident after 
      the treatment of F. elephantum for all three important vector mosquitoes. The
      synthesized AgNPs from F. elephantum were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous
      extract to three important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded
      from UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
      analysis (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Synthesized AgNPs
      against the vector mosquitoes A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus
      had the following lethal dose (LD)(5)(0) and LD(9)(0) values: A. stephensi had
      LD(5)(0) and LD(9)(0) values of 18.041 and 32.575 mug mL(-1); A. aegypti had
      LD(5)(0) and LD(9)(0) values of 20.399 and 37.534 mug mL(-1); and C.
      quinquefasciatus had LD(5)(0) and LD(9)(0) values of 21.798 and 39.596 mug
      mL(-1). No mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest that the 
      leaf aqueous extracts of F. elephantum and green synthesis of AgNPs have the
      potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the A. 
      stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. This is the first report on the
      adulticidal activity of the plant extracts and AgNPs.

AB  - Green synthesis technology is one of the rapid, reliable and best routes for the 
      synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). There are bioactive compounds with
      enormous potential in Azadirachta indica (Neem). The extraordinary mosquitoes
      warrant nanotechnology to integrate with novel molecules. This will be
      sustainable technology for future. Here, we synthesized AgNPs using aqueous
      extracts of leaves and bark of Az. indica (Neem). We tested AgNPs as larvicides, 
      pupicides and adulticides against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi and
      filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The results were obtained using
      UV-visible spectrophotometer and the images were recorded with a transmission
      electron microscope (TEM). The efficacy tests were then performed at different
      concentrations varying many hours by probit analysis. The synthesized AgNPs were 
      spherical in shape and with varied sizes (10.47-nm leaf and 19.22-nm bark). The
      larvae, pupae and adults of filariasis vector C. quinquefasciatus were found to
      be more susceptible to our AgNPs than the malaria vector An. stephensi. The first
      and the second instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus show a mortality rate of 100%
      after 30 min of exposure. The results against the pupa of C. quinquefasciatus
      were recorded as LC(5)(0) 4 ppm, LC(9)(0) 11 ppm and LC(9)(9) 13 ppm after 3 h of
      exposure. In the case of adult mosquitoes, LC(5)(0) 1.06 muL/cm(2), LC(9)(0) 2.13
      muL/cm(2) and LC(9)(9) 2.4 muL/cm(2) were obtained after 4 h of exposure. These
      results suggest that our AgNPs are environment-friendly for controlling malarial 
      and filarial vectors.

AB  - Salivary gland proteins of Anopheles mosquitoes offer attractive targets to
      understand interactions with sporozoites, blood feeding behavior, homeostasis,
      and immunological evaluation of malaria vectors and parasite interactions. To
      date limited studies have been carried out to elucidate salivary proteins of An. 
      stephensi salivary glands. The aim of the present study was to provide detailed
      analytical attributives of functional salivary gland proteins of urban malaria
      vector An. stephensi. A proteomic approach combining one-dimensional
      electrophoresis (1DE), ion trap liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
      (LC/MS/MS), and computational bioinformatic analysis was adopted to provide the
      first direct insight into identification and functional characterization of known
      salivary proteins and novel salivary proteins of An. stephensi. Computational
      studies by online servers, namely, MASCOT and OMSSA algorithms, identified a
      total of 36 known salivary proteins and 123 novel proteins analysed by LC/MS/MS. 
      This first report describes a baseline proteomic catalogue of 159 salivary
      proteins belonging to various categories of signal transduction, regulation of
      blood coagulation cascade, and various immune and energy pathways of An.
      stephensi sialotranscriptome by mass spectrometry. Our results may serve as basis
      to provide a putative functional role of proteins in concept of blood feeding,
      biting behavior, and other aspects of vector-parasite host interactions for
      parasite development in anopheline mosquitoes.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy of five types of long-lasting insecticidal nets against
      Anopheles fluviatilis, the primary malaria vector in east-central India.
PG  - 785-94
AB  - Five types of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs), namely, Olyset, Netprotect,
      PermaNet, DuraNet, and Interceptor, were tested after 20 washes for efficacy in
      terms of mortality, deterrence effect, blood-feeding inhibition, and induced
      exophily of the malaria vector Anopheles fluviatilis in experimental huts in
      Malkangiri district of Odisha State, India. Efficacy of the three synthetic
      pyrethroids (SPs) used in the LNs was also analyzed. Use of LNs reduced the entry
      of An. fluviatilis into the huts by 73.3-83.2%, and the five LNs were comparable 
      in terms of deterrence. The exit rate of An. fluviatilis from the huts with
      untreated net was 56.3%, and relative to this, Olyset followed by DuraNet induced
      significantly a higher exophily. In contrast, the exit rate was significantly
      lower with Interceptor. Among the three SPs, permethrin induced significantly
      greater exophily relative to the untreated control, and as a result of this,
      permethrin-treated Olyset produced a lower mortality. Blood-feeding rate of An.
      fluviatilis was significantly lower with all the five LNs than the control.
      Similarly, all the three SPs significantly inhibited blood feeding compared with 
      the control. Interceptor and DuraNet, both alphacypermethrin-treated LNs, caused 
      relatively a higher mortality of An. fluviatilis than the other LNs. The five
      brands of LNs and three SPs tested in the current study were equally effective in
      terms of deterrence and blood-feeding inhibition; only exiting and killing effect
      differed among them. Permethrin-treated LNs induced greater exophily, while,
      overall, alphacypermethrin-treated LNs killed more An. fluviatilis that entered
      the huts. Advantage of deterrence, excito-repellent, and killing effects of LNs
      and appropriate selection of SP for net treatment are discussed in this paper.

      Mongolia, China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Batai virus (BATV) is a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus of the
      family Bunyaviridae, and a vector-borne pathogen. Genomic variations of BATV
      exist in different regions of the world, due to genetic reassortment.
      Whole-genome sequencing of any isolate is necessary for a phylogenetic analysis. 
      In 1998, a BATV strain was isolated from an Anopheles philippines mosquito in
      Yunnan Province, China. This strain has not been found to infect any other host. 
      We investigated BATV infection in cattle in Inner Mongolia, China and performed
      deep sequencing of the genome of the BATV isolate. FINDINGS: Ninety-five blood
      samples were collected from cattle in Inner Mongolia, China in 2012. The BATV
      infection rate was 2.1%. Previously, BATV strain NM/12 was isolated from two
      cattle in Inner Mongolia, China, and the whole genomic sequence of the strain has
      been available. We determined the complete genomic nucleotide sequences of the
      small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genome segments using bovine blood obtained 
      in 2012, and the nucleotide homologies of these segments with those from GenBank 
      were 88.7%-97%, 84%-95.4%, and 72.6%-95.8%, respectively. The deduced amino acid 
      identities were 87.2-99.7%, 64.2-96.8%, and 81.1-98.6%. Phylogenetic analyses
      based on full-length genomic sequences indicated that the M and L segments, and a
      portion of the S segment, of NM/12 are most closely related to the BATV strains
      isolated in Asia. The S and M segments of NM/12 were independent of phylogenetic 
      lineages. The L segment was the most closely related to Chittoor/IG-20217
      (isolated in India), and distantly related to isolated strains in Italy.
      Nucleotide substitution rates in the nucleotide sequences that code for the
      nucleocapsid, envelope glycoprotein, and polymerase protein of NM/12 strain were 
      2.56%, 4.69%, and 4.21%, respectively, relative to the original strain of MM2222.
      CONCLUSION: A novel BATV NM/12 strain from bovine serum collected in Inner
      Mongolia was isolated from cattle in China for the first time. Our findings
      elucidate the evolutionary status of the BATV NM/12 strain among different
      orthobunyavirus strains and may provide some clues to prevent the emergence of
      BATV infection in cattle and humans.

TI  - Standardization of a bottle assay--an indigenous method for laboratory and field 
      monitoring of insecticide resistance and comparison with WHO adult susceptibility
      test.
PG  - 3859-66

AB  - The WHO adult susceptibility test is in use for insecticide resistance
      monitoring. Presently, materials are being imported from the Universiti Sains
      Malaysia, Malaysia and sometimes it is cost prohibitive. As an alternative, we
      present here a method of bottle bioassay using indigenous material. Different
      aspects related to the assay were studied and validated in the field. Bottle
      assay was standardized in the laboratory by using locally sourced material and
      laboratory-maintained insecticide-susceptible Anopheles stephensi and Aedes
      aegypti strains against technical grade deltamethrin and cyfluthrin insecticides 
      dissolved in ethanol in a range of different concentrations. The frequency of use
      of the deltamethrin-coated bottles and shelf-life were determined. Discriminating
      dose for deltamethrin and cyfluthrin was 10 mug against An. stephensi and 2 mug
      against Ae. aegypti females. Insecticide-coated bottles stored at 25 to 35
      degrees C can be used for three exposures within 7 days of coating. The study
      carried out in the laboratory was validated on wild caught An. culicifacies in
      the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh against deltamethrin-coated bottles in
      comparison to WHO adult susceptibility test. Results of the study indicated that 
      deltamethrin-coated bottles were effective up to three exposures within 7 days of
      coating for field population and 100% mortality was recorded within 35 min as
      observed in laboratory studies for field collected susceptible population. Also
      in the WHO adult susceptibility test, 100% knock-down within 35 min and 100%
      mortality after 24 h holding period were observed in susceptible population,
      while in it was 50% knock-down in 1 h and 64% mortality after 24 h holding period
      for resistant population (50% mortality in bottle assay in 60 min). The bottle
      assay can be used as an alternative to the WHO adult susceptibility test both in 
      the laboratory and field for monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito
      vectors using locally sourced material.

AB  - Development of insecticide resistance (IR) in mosquito vectors is a primary
      huddle to malaria control program. Since IR has genetic basis, and genes
      constantly evolve with response to environment for adaptation to organisms, it is
      important to know evolutionary pattern of genes conferring IR in malaria vectors.
      The mosquito Anopheles minimus is a major malaria vector of the Southeast (SE)
      Asia and India and is susceptible to all insecticides, and thus of interest to
      know if natural selection has shaped variations in the gene conferring IR. If
      not, the DNA fragment of such a gene could be used to infer population structure 
      and demography of this species of malaria vector. We have therefore sequenced a
      ~569 bp DNA segment of the NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) gene (widely
      known to confer IR) in 123 individuals of An. minimus collected in 10 different
      locations (eight Indian, one Thai and one Vietnamese). Two Indian population
      samples were completely mono-morphic in the CPR gene. In general, low genetic
      diversity was found with no evidence of natural selection in this gene. The data 
      were therefore analyzed to infer population structure and demography of this
      species. The 10 populations could be genetically differentiated into four
      different groups; the samples from Thailand and Vietnam contained high nucleotide
      diversity. All the 10 populations conform to demographic equilibrium model with
      signature of past population expansion in four populations. The results in
      general indicate that the An. minimus mosquitoes sampled in the two SE Asian
      localities contain several genetic characteristics of being parts of the
      ancestral population.

AB  - In the present investigation, the effective root compound of plumbagin of
      Plumbago zeylanica (Plumbaginaceae) was evaluated for chemical constituent and
      antimalarial effect against the fourth instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi
      Liston (Diptera). In the chromatographic analyses of root compound with Rf value 
      of 0.788 and NMR analyses also revealed that the effective compound contain
      naphthoquinone plumbagin were identified as the major chemical constituent.
      Larval mortality was observed after 3 h of exposure period. The plumbagin
      compound showed remarkable larvicidal activity against A. stephensi (LC50 32.65
      and LC9072.27 ppm). Histopathological effects of compound was observed in the
      treated larvae. Based on the results, the plumbagin compound of P. zeylanica can 
      be considered as a new source of natural larvicide for the control of malarial
      vector.

      (5a-5n) were synthesized by refluxing 3,3-dimethyl-2-oxobutanoic acid (trimethyl 
      pyruvic acid) (1) and thiocarbohydrazide (2) in ethanol as solvent for 12 h, to
      yield 3-mercapto-4-amino-6-tert-butyl-1,2,4-triazine-5(4H)-one (3) (Scheme 1),
      then the compound (3) was condensed with different substituted aryloxyacetic
      acids (4) in POCl3 at 90 degrees C for 8 h (Scheme 2). The structures of the
      newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, elemental 
      analyses and mass spectroscopic studies. Few of the synthesized compounds
      exhibited moderate mosquito-larvicidal and antibacterial activities. Among the
      novel derivatives, the compound (5f) showed relatively high larvicidal activity
      against a malaria vector. Compounds (5i) and (5m) exhibited a broad spectrum
      antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative species and hence 
      they may be considered as drug candidates for bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Anopheles stephensi is an important vector of urban malaria in India and the
      Persian Gulf area. Its previously known geographical range includes southern Asia
      and the Arab Peninsula. For the first time, we report A. stephensi from the
      African continent, based on collections made in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, 
      where this species' occurrence was linked to an unusual urban outbreak of
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria, with 1228 cases reported from February to May
      2013, and a second, more severe epidemic that emerged in November 2013 and
      resulted in 2017 reported malaria cases between January and February 2014.
      Anopheles stephensi was initially identified using morphological identification
      keys, followed by sequencing of the Barcode cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI) gene and
      the rDNA second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2). Positive tests for P.
      falciparum circumsporozoite antigen in two of six female A. stephensi trapped in 
      homes of malaria patients in March 2013 are evidence that autochthonous urban
      malaria transmission by A. stephensi has occurred. Concurrent with the second
      malaria outbreak, P. falciparum-positive A. stephensi females were detected in
      Djibouti City starting in November 2013. In sub-Saharan Africa, newly present A. 
      stephensi may pose a significant future health threat because of this species'
      high susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and its tolerance of urban
      habitats. This may lead to increased malaria outbreaks in African cities. Rapid
      interruption of the urban malaria transmission cycle, based on integrated vector 
      surveillance and control programs aimed at the complete eradication of A.
      stephensi from the African continent, is strongly recommended.

TI  - Differential expression of glutathione s-transferase enzyme in different life
      stages of various insecticide-resistant strains of Anopheles stephensi: a malaria
      vector.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Interest in insect glutathione s-transferases (GSTs) has
      primarily focused on their role in insecticide resistance. These play an
      important role in biotransformation and detoxification of many different
      xenobiotic and endogenous substances including insecticides. The GST activity
      among 10 laboratory selected insecticide resistant and susceptible/control
      strains of Anopheles stephensi was compared using the substrates
      1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The difference in the GST activities of
      different life stages of diverse insecticide resistant strains was compared and
      presented. METHODS: About 100 larvae, pupae, adult males, adult females and eggs 
      (100 mug in total weight) were collected and used for the experiment. The
      extracts were prepared from each of the insecticide-resistant strains and
      control. Protein contents of the enzyme homogenate and GST activities were
      determined. RESULTS: Deltamethrin and cyfluthrin-resistant strains of An.
      stephensi showed significantly higher GST activity. Larvae and pupae of
      DDT-resistant strain showed peak GST activity followed by the propoxur-resistant 
      strain. On contrary, the GST activity was found in reduced quantity in
      alphamethrin, bifenthrin, carbofuran and chloropyrifos resistant strains. Adults 
      of either sexes showed higher GST activity in mosquito strain resistant to
      organophosphate group of insecticides namely, temephos and chloropyrifos.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The GST activity was closely associated with almost 
      all of the insecticides used in the study, strengthening the fact that one of the
      mechanisms associated with resistance includes an increase of GST activity. This 
      comparative data on GST activity in An. stephensi can be useful database to
      identify possible underlying mechanisms governing insecticide-resistance by GSTs.

TI  - Brain proteomics of Anopheles gambiae.
PG  - 421-37
LID - 10.1089/omi.2014.0007 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles gambiae has a well-adapted system for host localization, feeding, and
      mating behavior, which are all governed by neuronal processes in the brain.
      However, there are no published reports characterizing the brain proteome to
      elucidate neuronal signaling mechanisms in the vector. To this end, a large-scale
      mapping of the brain proteome of An. gambiae was carried out using high
      resolution tandem mass spectrometry, revealing a repertoire of >1800 proteins, of
      which 15% could not be assigned any function. A large proportion of the
      identified proteins were predicted to be involved in diverse biological processes
      including metabolism, transport, protein synthesis, and olfaction. This study
      also led to the identification of 10 GPCR classes of proteins, which could govern
      sensory pathways in mosquitoes. Proteins involved in metabolic and neural
      processes, chromatin modeling, and synaptic vesicle transport associated with
      neuronal transmission were predominantly expressed in the brain. Proteogenomic
      analysis expanded our findings with the identification of 15 novel genes and 71
      cases of gene refinements, a subset of which were validated by RT-PCR and
      sequencing. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into the brain physiology
      of the vector that could possibly open avenues for intervention strategies for
      malaria in the future.

AB  - Carboxypeptidases are the digestive enzymes which cleave single amino acid
      residue from c-terminus of the protein. Digestive carboxypeptidase A gene
      regulatory elements in insects have shown their efficiency to drive midgut
      specific expression in transgenic mosquitoes. However no endogenous promoter has 
      been reported for Indian malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies which is major
      vector in Indian subcontinent. Here we report cloning of carboxypeptidase A gene 
      in the An. culicifacies A including its 5' upstream regions and named AcCP. In
      the upstream region of the gene an arthropod initiator sequence and two repeat
      sequences of the particular importance TTATC and GTTTT were also identified. The 
      1290 base pairs open reading frame encodes a protein of 48.5kDa. The coding
      region of the gene shares 82% and 72% similarity at nucleotide level with
      Anopheles gambiae and Ae. aegypti carboxypeptidase A gene, respectively. The peak
      expression of the gene was found to be at 3h after blood feeding and this is
      limited to midgut only. Based on the protein sequence, 3D structure of the AcCP
      was predicted and the active centre of the enzyme was predicted to consist of GLN
      183, GLU 186, HIS 308 and Ser 309 amino acid residues. Comparison of the protein 
      sequence among different genera revealed the conservation of zinc binding
      residues. Phylogenetically, AcCP was found most closely related to An. gambiae.

      culicifacies.
PG  - 235
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has been well documented that gut flora not only 
      influence mosquito physiology, but also significantly alter vector competency.
      Although, salivary gland and gut constitute key partners of the digestive system,
      it is still believed that salivary glands may harbor less flora than gut (Parasit
      Vectors 6: 146, 2013). METHODS: Using a metagenomic approach, we have identified 
      for the first time the diverse microbial community associated with these two
      physiologically different tissues of the digestive system in the mosquito
      Anopheles culicifacies. RESULTS: A total of 17 different phyla could be assigned 
      to the whole metagenomic dataset, predominated by the phylum Proteobacteria,
      Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Tenericutes and Actinomycetes. Common bacteria
      included the members of Enhydrobacter, Agromonas, Serratia, Ralsonia,
      Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Rubrobacter, Anaerococcus,
      Methylobacterium, Turicibacter, Elizabethkingia etc. in both the tissues
      representing 'core microbiota' of the mosquito digestive system. Salivary
      associated unique bacterial community included the members of Chloriflexi,
      Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Nitrospira, TM7, Armatimonadetes, Planctomycetes,
      Fibrobacteres etc. CONCLUSION: We find that the salivary gland microbial
      community structure is more diverse than gut of the mosquito, probably due to
      differential feeding associated engagements such as food acquisition, ingestion
      and digestion processes.

AB  - Blood feeding is an integral process required for physiological functions and
      propagation of the malaria vector Anopheles. During blood feeding, presence of
      the malaria parasite, Plasmodium in the blood induces several host effector
      molecules including microRNAs which play important roles in the development and
      maturation of the parasite within the mosquito. The present study was undertaken 
      to elucidate the dynamic expression of miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle and
      parasite development in Anopheles stephensi. Using next generation sequencing
      technology, we identified 126 miRNAs of which 17 were novel miRNAs. The miRNAs
      were further validated by northern hybridization and cloning. Blood feeding and
      parasitized blood feeding in the mosquitoes revealed regulation of 13 and 16
      miRNAs respectively. Expression profiling of these miRNAs revealed that
      significant miRNAs were down-regulated upon parasitized blood feeding with a
      repertoire of miRNAs showing stage specific up-regulation. Expression profiles of
      significantly modulated miRNAs were further validated by real time PCR. Target
      prediction of regulated miRNAs revealed overlapping targeting by different
      miRNAs. These targets included several metabolic pathways including metabolic,
      redox homeostasis and protein processing machinery components. Our analysis
      revealed tight regulation of specific miRNAs post blood feeding and parasite
      infection in An. stephensi. Such regulated expression suggests possible role of
      these miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle in mosquito. Another set of miRNAs were
      also significantly regulated at 42 h and 5 days post infection indicating
      parasite stage-specific role of host miRNAs. This study will result in better
      understanding of the role of miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle and parasite
      development in mosquito and can probably facilitate in devising novel malaria
      control strategies at vector level.

AB  - A one-step and eco-friendly process for the synthesis of silver-(protein-lipid)
      nanoparticles (Ag-PL NPs) (core-shell) has been developed using the seed extract 
      from wild Indian Almond tree, Sterculia foetida (L.) (Sterculiaceae). The
      reaction temperature played a major role in controlling the size and shell
      formation of NPs. The amount of NPs synthesized and qualitative characterization 
      was done by UV-vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
      respectively. TEM studies exhibited controlled dispersity of spherical shaped NPs
      with an average size of 6.9+/-0.2nm. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
      and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed 'fcc' phase and crystallinity of the
      particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the
      protein-lipid (PL) bilayer that appears as a shell around the Ag core particles. 
      The thermal stability of the Ag-PL NPs was examined using thermogravimetric
      analysis (TGA). Further analysis was carried out by using Fourier transform
      infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), where the spectra provided evidence for the
      presence of proteins and lipid moieties ((2n-octylcycloprop-1-enyl)-octanoic acid
      (I)), and their role in synthesis and stabilization of Ag NPs. This is the first 
      report of plant seed assisted synthesis of PL conjugated Ag NPs. These formed
      Ag-PL NPs showed potential mosquito larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti
      (L.), Anopheles stephensi Liston and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. These Ag-PL NPs 
      can also act as promising agents in cancer therapy. They exhibited
      anti-proliferative activity against HeLa cancer cell lines and a promising
      toxicity was observed in a dose dependent manner. Toxicity studies were further
      supported by the cellular DNA fragmentation in the Ag-PL NPs treated HeLa cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vector monitoring in military stations would help in protecting the
      armed forces from vector borne diseases such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis
      and filariasis. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were collected from four villages
      around a military station in India using light traps and the species composition 
      was estimated. Insecticide susceptibility of disease vectors against DDT,
      deltamethrin and permethrin was established using WHO kits. RESULTS: The known
      malaria vectors constituted 4.9% of the total mosquito collections and Anopheles 
      philippinensis/nivipes (2.05%) was the most abundant. Japanese encephalitis and
      dengue vectors constituted 25.3 and 0.05% whereas the known vectors of both
      Japanese encephalitis and filariasis formed 50.9%. The mean (+/-SEmean) of annual
      parasitic index, slide positivity and Plasmodium falciparum percentage among the 
      civilian population during the study period were 1.46 +/- 0.37, 1.65 +/- 0.77 and
      50.2 +/- 10.7. The filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus was resistant to DDT 
      with 65.4% mortality whereas the DDT resistance in the Japanese encephalitis
      vector Culex vishnui gr. with 91.9% mortality needs to be confirmed. All other
      species tested were susceptible to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. CONCLUSION: 
      Targeted interventions are needed to reduce the disease burden and vector
      activity in the villages adjoining the military station. The use of insect
      repellents, bed nets and repellent impregnated uniforms by the troops should be
      ensured for protection from vector borne diseases.

AB  - Anopheles annularis is one of the major vectors of malaria in Odisha, India. The 
      present study was undertaken to determine the vectorial capacity and assess the
      genetic diversity of An. annularis collected from different endemic regions of
      Odisha. Mosquitoes were collected from thirteen endemic districts using standard 
      entomological collection methods from 2009 to 2011. Sibling species of An.
      annularis were identified by PCR-RFLP and sequencing of D3 region of 28S
      ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite rate and human
      blood fed percentage (HBF) were estimated by multiplex PCR using Pf and human
      specific primers. Genetic diversity of An. annularis was estimated by ISSR
      markers. Out of 1647 An. annularis collected, 1353 (82.15%) were collected by
      mechanical aspirators and 294 (17.85%) by light trap. 49 (2.97%) were positive
      for human blood and 18 (1.09%) were positive for Pf sporozoite. PCR-RFLP and
      sequencing analyses detected only An annularis A in the study areas. Overall
      genetic differentiation among An. annularis populations was moderate (FST=0.048) 
      and showed significant correlation between genetic distance and geographic
      distance (r=0.882; P<0.05). Angul population proved to be genetically unique and 
      was highly divergent FST>0.110) from other populations, suggesting low gene flow 
      between them. The study indicated that only An. annularis A was found in Odisha
      with potential vectorial capacity that can play a major role in malaria
      transmission. ISSR markers proved to be useful molecular tools to evaluate
      genetic variability in An. annularis populations.

AB  - Mosquitoes in the larval stage are attractive targets for pesticides because
      mosquitoes breed in water, and thus, it is easy to deal with them in this
      habitat. The use of conventional pesticides in the water sources, however,
      introduces many risks to people and/or the environment. Natural pesticides,
      especially those derived from plants, are more promising in this aspect. Aromatic
      plants and their essential oils are very important sources of many compounds that
      are used in different respects. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
      suitable alternative to chemical insecticides. Acetone, chloroform, ethyl
      acetate, methanol, and petroleum benzine leaf extracts of Clausena dentata were
      tested against the fourth instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Culex
      quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Larval mortality was
      observed after 24 h of exposure. The highest larval mortality was found in
      acetone leaf extract, C. quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 0.150278 mg/ml; LC90 = 7.302613
      mg/ml), A. aegypti (LC50 = 0.169495 mg/ml; LC90 = 1.10034 mg/ml), and A.
      stephensi (LC50 = 0.045684 mg/ml; LC90 = 0.045684 mg/ml). GC-MS analysis of plant
      extracts of acetone solvent revealed 16 compounds, of which the major compounds
      were benzene,1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-(2-propenyl) (14.97%),
      Z,Z-6,28-heptatriactontadien-2-one (6.81%), 2-allyl-4-methylphenol (28.14%),
      2-allyl-4-methylphenol (17.34%), and 2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene,
      2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl (10.35%). Our result shows acetone leaf extracts of C.
      dentata have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for
      mosquito control.

AB  - The abundance, richness and diversity of anopheline and culicid mosquitoes
      associated with their habitats, season, and physico-chemical quality of water
      were surveyed along six districts of Mizoram, North Eastern Himalayan region. The
      productivity of permanent and temporary habitat types was quantified by carrying 
      out weekly larval sampling using a standard dipping method for a period of three 
      years. Diversity was estimated using the Shannon index (H'), Evenness index
      (Heve), similarity measures cluster analysis and MANOVA. In total, 5 genera and
      20 species of mosquitoes were identified: Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles
      barbirostris and Anopheles vagus were the most abundant and widely-distributed
      species, representing 39.71%, 29.39% and 14.52% of total mosquito individuals
      sampled, respectively. Anopheles sp. diversity was lowest in Lunglei district
      (H'=0.48) and highest in Aizawl (H'=2.03), whereas Culex sp. diversity was lowest
      in Lawngtlai (H'=0.38), and highest in Aizawl (H'=2.99) and Kolasib (H'=2.13).
      This represents the first update on the diversity and geographic distribution of 
      the mosquitoes of Mizoram. Mosquito larvae were present in both temporary and
      permanent habitats suitable for breeding with monthly variations dependent on
      rainfall intensity, temperature, humidity and location. Early instars were more
      abundant significantly (P<0.0001) than late instars among the habitat types in
      all study sites. The productivity of mosquito larvae was significantly (P<0.0001)
      higher in ponds especially in permanent than semi-permanent and temporary. Weekly
      rainfall intensity led to an increase or decrease in anopheline and culicid
      larval abundance depending on the location. Mosquito diversity was highest in
      monsoon season (July-September) and lowest in January-March. A. barbirostris, A. 
      vagus and C. quinquefasciatus appear the most likely habitat generalist as it
      demonstrates both widespread distribution. Abundance and diversity of culicine
      and anopheline larvae were strongly associated (MANOVA) with pH, temperature,
      dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, phosphates and chlorides concentration of water.
      This information will be essential for designing and implementing mosquito larval
      control programs.

TI  - Microfilaria in human subcutaneous dirofilariasis: a case report.
PG  - 113-4
LID - 10.7860/JCDR/2013/6886.4123 [doi]
AB  - Human subcutaneous dirofilariasis, a rare zoonosis is being increasingly reported
      from various parts of the world. Most of the reported cases have lesions in and
      around the eye. The adult female dirofilariae release microfilaria into the
      definitive host's blood. Various mosquitoes that serve as intermediate hosts such
      as Culex, Aedes and Anopheles take up the microfilariae (mf-L1) while feeding on 
      an infected host. Microfilariae develop in the mosquitoes. The transmission to
      dogs or other hosts including humans occurs through mosquito bite during
      subsequent blood meal. Humans may be infected as aberrant (accidental) hosts,
      mainly by D. repens and D. immitis. D. repens usually resides subcutaneously,
      while D. immitis frequently ends up in the human lung. In human infections
      usually just one larva develops, which does not reach sexual maturity. In India, 
      almost all reported cases of dirofilariasis in humans have involvement of face in
      the form of ocular dirofilariasis with a few reports on subcutaneous
      dirofilariasis. We report a case of human subcutaneous dirofilariasis, from
      western India, involving leg and showing microfilaria in tissue indicating
      presence of gravid female dirofilaria (sexual maturity). To the best of our
      knowledge, it is among rare cases of subcutaneous dirofilariasis wherein
      microfilariae have developed in human host.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit dreadful diseases to human beings wherein biological control 
      of these vectors using plant-derived molecules would be an alternative to reduce 
      mosquito population. In the present study activity of aqueous leaf extract and
      silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Helitropium indicum plant leaves
      against late third instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex 
      quinquefasciatus. The range of varying concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (8,
      16, 24, 32, and 40 mug/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150
      mug/mL) were tested against the larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus. The synthesized AgNPs from H. indicum were highly toxic
      than crude leaf aqueous extract in three important vector mosquito species. The
      results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
      analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and histogram. The synthesized AgNPs 
      showed larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure. Considerable mortality was
      evident after the treatment of H. indicum for all three important vector
      mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of H. indicum aqueous leaf extract appeared 
      to be effective against A. stephensi (LC50, 68.73 mug/mL; LC90, 121.07 mug/mL)
      followed by A. aegypti (LC50, 72.72 mug/mL; LC90, 126.86 mug/mL) and C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC50, 78.74 mug/mL; LC90, 134.39 mug/mL). Synthesized AgNPs
      against the vector mosquitoes of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C.
      quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90 values: A. stephensi had LC50
      and LC90 values of 18.40 and 32.45 mug/mL, A. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of
      20.10 and 35.97 mug/mL, and C. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 21.84
      and 38.10 mug/mL. No mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest
      that the leaf aqueous extracts of H. indicum and green synthesis of silver
      nanoparticles have the potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for 
      the control of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. This is the
      first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the plant extracts and
      synthesized nanoparticles.

TI  - Response of malaria vectors to conventional insecticides in the southern
      districts of Odisha State, India.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Updating information on response (susceptible /
      resistant status) of vectors to the insecticides in use is essential to formulate
      and introduce appropriate resistance management strategy. Therefore, a study was 
      undertaken in the 10 southern districts of Odisha State, which are endemic for
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria, to determine the insecticide susceptibility/
      resistance status of Anopheles fluviatilis and An. culicifacies, the vectors of
      malaria. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected during September 2010 - February 2012
      from 60 randomly selected villages in the 10 districts and blood-fed females were
      exposed to the diagnostic dosage of DDT (4.0%), malathion (5.0%) and deltamethrin
      (0.05%) for one hour. Mortality was recorded at 24 h after the exposure. The test
      mortality was corrected to the control mortality. RESULTS: An. fluviatilis was
      susceptible to the three insecticides tested while, An. culicifacies was
      resistant to DDT and malathion in all the 10 districts except in two, where its
      response against malathion was under 'verification required' category. Against
      deltamethrin, An. culicifacies was susceptible in two districts; while in the
      other eight districts its response was under 'verification required' category.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Since An. fluviatilis the vector species primarily 
      associated with transmission of malaria, was still susceptible to DDT, indoor
      residual spraying with DDT could be continued in the 10 districts. Also, in view 
      of the large scale implementation of long lasting insecticidal nets and the signs
      of development of resistance in An. culicifacies to deltamethrin, response of the
      vectors to synthetic pyrethroids needs to be periodically monitored.

TI  - Interaction affinity of Delta and Epsilon class glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs)
      to bind with DDT for detoxification and conferring resistance in Anopheles
      gambiae, a malaria vector.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The enzyme glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) are
      associated with detoxification of DDT, as experimentally proved in Anopheles
      gambiae. Insect GSTs are classified into six classes and among them Delta and
      Epsilon class GSTs have been implicated in detoxification of organochlorine
      insecticides. Both Delta and Epsilon GSTs produce, in total, 24 transcripts that 
      result in the production of corresponding enzyme proteins. However, the
      conventional assay estimates the level of total GSTs and relates to development
      of resistance to DDT. Hence, it would be more reliable to estimate the level of
      the specific class GSTs that shows higher affinity with DDT. This would also lead
      to design a specific molecular tool for resistance diagnosis. METHODS: Of the 24 
      GSTs, computational models for 23 GSTs, which are available in Swiss-Prot
      database, were retrieved and for the remaining one, D7-2, for which no model is
      available in the data bank, a structural model was developed using the sequence
      of An. dirus B with a PDB ID of 1R5A as the template. All the models were docked 
      with DDT in the presence of reduced glutathione. RESULTS: The energy output
      showed that Delta, D6 has the highest interaction affinity with DDT. Hence, this 
      particular GST (D6) is likely to get elevated on exposure of mosquitoes to DDT.
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: It would be, therefore, possible to design a
      specific molecular assay to determine the expression level of such high affinity 
      transcript(s) and to use for resistance diagnosis reliably in the vector
      surveillance programme.

TI  - A three year study on distribution and ecology of Anophelines in Thenzawl,
      Mizoram, India.
PG  - 369-76
AB  - A systematic survey on Anopheline species abundance, bionomics and habitat
      preference was conducted for three years in Thenzawl, Mizoram. A scoop-net method
      was employed for larval collection and a local made killing-jar for adults. A
      total of 10 species Anopheles campestris (25.8%), An. nivipes (24.0%), An. vagus 
      (20.6%), An. jamesii (15.1%), An. jeyporiensis (11.4%), An. maculatus (1.7%), An.
      philippinensis (0.7%), An. annularis (0.26%), An. sinensis (0.23%) and An.
      peditaeniatus (0.22%) were collected. The survey site having thick tall grasses, 
      numerous rural-huts as residents, small to relatively larger ponds and very slow 
      running water bodies well shaded from sunlight with floating aquatic plants
      provided the largest area for Anopheles larvae breeding and accounted for 40% of 
      all Anopheles larva and 25.4% total Anopheles spp. collected. An. campestris
      (NSK01), maculatus (NSK04), philippinensis (NSK06), nivipes (NSK10) and
      jeyporiensis (NSK09) were strongly anthropogenic and endophagic while vagus
      (NSK18) and jamesii (NSK03) were found to be highly zoophilic and exophilic and
      An. peditaeniatus (NSK02), annularis (NSK07) and sinensis (NSK15) were found to
      be highly zoophilic. Because of its abundance and bionomics, An. campestris,
      jeyporiensis and nivipes may have played a role in malarial transmission
      throughout the year. This is the first study reported on Anopheline distribution 
      and abundance in Thenzawl, Mizoram.

TI  - Larvicidal potential of wild mustard (Cleome viscosa) and gokhru (Tribulus
      terrestris) against mosquito vectors in the semi-arid region of Western
      Rajasthan.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - Cleome viscosa L. (Family: Capparaceae) commonly known as Tickweed or wild
      mustard and Tribulus terrestris L. (Family: Zygophyllaceae) commonly known as
      Gokhru, growing wildly in the desert areas in the monsoon and post monsoon
      season, are of great medicinal importance. Comparative larvicidal efficacy of the
      extracts from seeds of C. viscosa and fruits and leaves of T. terrestris was
      evaluated against 3rd or early 4th stage larvae of Anopheles stephensi (Liston), 
      Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) in different organic
      solvents. 24 and 48 hr LC50 and LC90 values along with their 95% fiducial limits,
      regression equation, chi-square (chi2)/ heterogeneity of the response was
      determined by log probit regression analysis. The 24 hr LC50 values as determined
      for seeds of C. viscosa were 144.1, 99.5 and 127.1 (methanol); 106.3, 138.9 and
      118.5 (acetone) and 166.4, 162.5 and 301.9 mg l(-1) (petroleum ether extracts)
      for all the three mosquito species respectively showing that methanol and acetone
      extracts were a little bit more effective than the petroleum ether extracts.
      Experiments were carried out with fruits and leaves of T. terrestris with all the
      solvents and mosquito species. The 24 hr LC50 values, as determined for fruits of
      T. terrestris were 70.8, 103.4 and 268.2 (methanol); 74.0,120.5 and 132.0
      (acetone) and 73.8,113.5 and 137.4 mg l(-1) (petroleum ether extracts) while the 
      24 hr LC50 values for leaves were 124.3, 196.8 and 246.5 (methanol); 163.4, 196.9
      and 224.3 (acetone) and 135.8, 176.8 and 185.9 mg l(-1) (petroleum ether
      extracts) for all the three mosquito species respectively. The results clearly
      indicate that fruit extracts of T. terrestris were more effective as compared to 
      leaves extracts in the three solvents tested. Larvae of An. stephensi were found 
      more sensitive to both fruit and leaves extracts of T. terrestris followed by
      larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Extracts from the seeds of C.
      viscosa were found less effective as compared to the fruit extracts of T.
      terrestris indicating that active larvicidal principle may be present in the
      fruits of this plant species. The studywould be of great importance while
      formulating the control strategy, for vectors of malaria, dengue and lymphatic
      filariasis, based on alternative plant based insecticides in this semi-arid
      region.

TI  - Low-cost and eco-friendly green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Feronia

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In the present study, the larvicidal activity 
      of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Feronia elephantum plant leaf
      extract against late third-instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti,
      and Culex quinquefasciatus was determined. The range of concentrations of
      synthesized AgNPs (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mug mL(-1)) and aqueous leaf extract
      (25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mug mL(-1)) were tested against the larvae of A.
      stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. Larvae were exposed to varying
      concentrations of aqueous crude extract and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h.
      Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of F. elephantum for all
      three important vector mosquitoes. The synthesized AgNPs from F. elephantum were 
      highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract to three important vector mosquito
      species. The results were recorded from UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier
      transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDX). Synthesized AgNPs against
      the vector mosquitoes A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus had the
      following LC50 and LC90 values: A. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 11.56
      and 20.56 mug mL(-1); A. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 13.13 and 23.12 mug 
      mL(-1); and C. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 14.19 and 24.30 mug
      mL(-1). No mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest that the 
      green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using F. elephantum has the potential to 
      be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of A. stephensi, A.
      aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. This is the first report on the mosquito
      larvicidal activity of the plant extracts and synthesized nanoparticles.

      against three mosquito species.
PG  - 6736-43
LID - 10.1007/s11356-014-2591-7 [doi]
AB  - In mosquito control programs, insecticides of botanical origin have the potential
      to eliminate eggs, larvae, and adults. So, the larvicidal, ovicidal, and
      oviposition-deterrent activities of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts of
      the leaves of Eugenia jambolana, Solidago canadensis, Euodia ridleyi, and
      Spilanthes mauritiana were assayed against the three vector mosquito species,
      namely Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The larval
      bioassay was conducted following the World Health Organization method. The
      maximum larval mortality was found with ethyl acetate extract of S. mauritiana
      against the larvae of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with LC50
      values of 11.51, 28.1, 14.10 ppm, respectively. The mean percent hatchability of 
      the ovicidal activity was observed at 48-h post-treatment. The percent
      hatchability was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of the
      extract and directly proportional to the number of eggs. The flower head extract 
      of S. mauritiana gave 100% mortality followed by E. ridleyi, S. canadensis, and
      E. jambolana against the eggs of the three mosquito vectors. For
      oviposition-deterrent effect, out of the five concentrations tested (20, 40, 60, 
      80, and 100 ppm), the concentration of 100 ppm showed a significant egg
      laying-deterrent capacity. The oviposition activity index value of E. jambolana, 
      E. ridleyi, S. canadensis, and S. mauritiana against A. aegypti, A. stephensi, C.
      quinquefasciatus at 100 ppm were -0.71, -0.71, -0.90, -0.93, -0.85, -0.91, -1,
      -1, -0.71, -0.85, -1, and -1, respectively. These results suggest that the
      leaf/flower extracts of certain local plants have the potential to be developed
      as possible eco-friendly means for the control of mosquitoes.

TI  - Anopheles subpictus B and its role in transmission of malaria in Odisha, India.
PG  - 710-7
AB  - Odisha state is highly endemic for malaria and among several Anopheline species
      found in the state, Anopheles subpictus is known to be one of the most prevalent 
      species. An. subpictus complex consists of four sibling species i,e A,B,C and D. 
      However, no work has been conducted on prevalence of sibling species of An.
      subpictus in Odisha. Hence attempt was made to study the prevalence of sibling
      species of An. subpictus and their role in transmission of malaria in four
      districts i,e Angul, Khurda, Cuttack and Puri of Odisha using Mitochondrial Gene,
      Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) known as DNA barcode. The sibling species B 
      of An. subpictus with sporozoite were reported for the first time in Odisha.

TI  - DDT & deltamethrin resistance status of known Japanese encephalitis vectors in
      Assam, India.
PG  - 988-94
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Japanese encephalitis (JE) outbreaks are common in Assam,
      northeastern State of India. Information on resistance in known JE vectors in the
      affected area is important for effective control measures. This study was
      undertaken to determine the species abundance of JE vectors endemic to Sibsagar
      district of Assam, and their susceptibility against DDT and deltamethrin.
      METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC light trap and aspirators from
      human dwellings from 13 endemic villages falling under three Primary Health
      Centres. Collected mosquitoes were identified and unfed female mosquitoes were
      used for DDT and deltamethrin sensitivity bioassay. The bioassay was performed
      following WHO protocol using standard susceptibility test kit. Knockdown time
      (KDT) was monitored at every 10 minutes intervals, whereas mortalities were
      recorded 24 h post-exposure. Vector density and resistance status were mapped
      using geographic information system (GIS) technique. RESULTS: A total of 7655
      mosquitoes were sampled under three genera, i.e. Anopheles, Culex and Mansonia,
      and nine species, the JE vector Cx. vishnui group (31.78%) was the most
      predominant species, followed by Ma. uniformis (16.81%) and Ma. indiana (16.45%).
      All vector species were suspected to be resistant to DDT and sensitive to
      deltamethrin, except Ma. indiana, which was suspected to deltamethrin resistant. 
      The KDT50 and KDT95 values of vector mosquitoes for DDT were significantly higher
      as compared to deltamethrin. The probit model used to estimate KDT50 and KDT95
      values did not display normal distribution of percentage knockdown with time for 
      all the vectors tested for DDT and deltamethrin, except for Ma. indiana for
      deltamethrin assay and Cx. gelidus for the DDT assay. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSION: Differences in insecticide resistance status were observed between
      insecticides and vector species. The results of this study provided baseline data
      on insecticide resistance in known JE vectors of Sibsagar, Assam. The maps
      generated may allow better communication in control operations and comparison of 
      changes in susceptibility status of these vectors over time.

TI  - Anopheline ecology and malaria transmission during the construction of an
      irrigation canal in an endemic district of Odisha, India.
PG  - 248-57
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A new irrigation canal system is under construction in
      Dhenkanal district of Odisha, to increase the production of rice crop and thereby
      improve the living standard of farmers in the project area. Construction of canal
      may increase the transmission of malaria by creating vector breeding habitats.
      Knowledge about bionomics of vectors will support authorities for appropriate
      management of the disease in a changing ecological set up. The aim of this study 
      was to assess the malaria transmission in the bank of the canal area under
      construction. METHODS: The entomological survey was carried out in three seasons,
      winter, summer and rainy during the period November 2008-October 2010 in the
      study area. Adult mosquitoes were collected by using suction tubes and flash
      lights. Mosquito species identification was done by using standard keys,
      separated according to abdominal conditions and were kept in an isopropanol for
      further molecular analysis of sibling species, presence of sporozoites and human 
      blood meal. Larvae were collected by dippers and reared in the laboratory, and
      the emerged adults were identified to species. The epidemiology of malaria was
      evaluated from the data collected by the State Health Department. Insecticide
      succeptibility test was done by WHO method. RESULTS: The adult mosquito
      collection from the study area showed the prevalence of 14 species belonging to
      three genera, i.e. Anopheles, Culex and Aedes. The per man hour densities (PMHD) 
      of An. culicifacies were 3.8, 1.4, 4.8; that of An. annularis were 2.1, 1, 2.1;
      and that of An. fluviatilis were 1.4, 0.3, 0.6 during winter, summer and rainy
      seasons respectively. Sibling species identified were: An. culicifacies A, B, C
      and D, An. annularis A and An. fluviatilis S. Sporozoite rates of An.
      culicifacies A and C were 1.1 and 0.5% respectively and that of An. annularis A
      was 2% (reported for the first time in the state). Both the vectors (An.
      culicifacies and An. annularis) showed resistance to DDT and malathion and were
      susceptible to deltamethrin, whereas An. fluviatilis was susceptible to all the
      three insecticides tested. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Anopheles culicifacies,
      An. fluviatilis and An. annularis were prevalent in all the three seasons. The
      artificial ponds and seepage pools of canal are the major breeding sites for An. 
      culicifacies and An. annularis. Thus, in the canal command area, control of
      malaria transmission requires use of insecticide-treated bednets and use of
      biolarvicides (seepage pools) and larvivorous fish (artificial ponds) wherever
      feasible.

      (Family: Asparagaceae) root extracts against filariasis (Culex quinquefasciatus),

AB  - Several diseases are associated to the mosquito-human interaction. Mosquitoes are
      the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, arboviral
      encephalitis, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, West Nile virus and yellow fever. 
      These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and
      livestock around the world. The present investigation was undertaken to study the
      ovicidal, larvicidal and adulticidal activities of crude hexane, ethyl acetate,
      benzene, chloroform and methanol extracts of root of Asparagus racemosus were
      assayed for their toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae). The
      mean percent hatchability of the eggs was observed after 48 h post-treatment. The
      percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract
      and directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed
      moderate ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract showed the highest
      ovicidal activity. The methanol extract of Asparagus racemosus against Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi exerted 100% mortality
      (zero hatchability) at 375, 300 and 225 ppm, respectively. Control eggs showed
      99-100% hatchability. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure.
      All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval
      mortality was found in methanol extract of root of Asparagus racemosus against
      the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi with 
      the LC50 and LC90 values were 115.13, 97.71 and 90.97 ppm and 210.96, 179.92, and
      168.82 ppm, respectively. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h recovery
      period. The plant crude extracts showed dose-dependent mortality. At higher
      concentrations, the adult showed restless movement for some times with abnormal
      wagging and then died. Among the extracts tested, the highest adulticidal
      activity was observed in methanol extract against Anopheles stephensi followed by
      Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus with the LD50 and LD90 values were
      120.44, 135.60, and 157.71 ppm and 214.65, 248.35, and 290.95 ppm, respectively. 
      No mortality was recorded in the control. The finding of the present
      investigation revealed that the root extract of Asparagus racemosus possess
      remarkable ovicidal, larvicidal and adulticidal activity against medically
      important vector mosquitoes and this is the low cost and ideal eco-friendly
      approach for the control of mosquitoes. This is the first report on the mosquito 
      ovicidal, larvicidal and adulticidal activities of the reported Asparagus
      racemosus root.

TI  - Evaluation of the mtDNA-COII Region Based Species Specific Assay for Identifying 
      Members of the Anopheles culicifacies Species Complex.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies, a major malarial vector has been recognized
      as a complex of five sibling species, A, B, C, D and E. These sibling species
      exhibit varied vectorial capacity, host specificity and susceptibility to
      malarial parasites/ insecticides. In this study, a PCR assay developed earlier
      for distinguishing the five individual species was validated on samples of An.
      culicifacies collected from various parts of India. METHODS: The samples were
      initially screened using the rDNA-ITS2 region based primers which categorised the
      samples into either A/D group or B/C/E group. A proportion of samples belonging
      to each group were subjected to the mtDNA-COII PCR assay for identifying
      individual species. RESULTS: Among the 615 samples analysed by rDNA-ITS2 PCR
      assay, 303 were found to belong to A/D group and 299 to B/C/E group while 13
      turned negative. Among 163 samples belonging to A/D group, only one sample
      displayed the profile characteristic of species A and among the 176 samples
      falling in the B/C/E group, 51 were identified as species B, 14 as species C and 
      41 as species E respectively by the mtDNA-COII PCR assay. Samples exhibiting
      products diagnostic of B/C/E, when subjected to PCR-RFLP assay identified 15
      samples as species E. CONCLUSION: Validation of the mtDNA-COII PCR assay on large
      number of samples showed that this technique cannot be used universally to
      distinguish the 5 members of this species complex, as it has been designed based 
      on minor/single base differences observed in the COII region.

AB  - Mosquitoes are the major vector for the transmission of malaria, dengue fever,
      yellow fever, filariasis, schistosomiasis, and Japanese encephalitis. Mosquito
      control is facing a threat because of the emergence of resistance to synthetic
      insecticides. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as suitable alternative 
      biocontrol techniques in the future. In view of the recently increased interest
      in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical
      insecticide, this study was undertaken to assess the larvicidal, ovicidal, and
      adulticidal potential of the crude hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate,
      and methanol solvent extracts from the medicinal plant Erythrina indica against
      the medically important mosquito vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and
      Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The larval mortality was observed
      after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however,
      the highest larval mortality was found in methanol extract of leaf of E. indica
      against the larvae of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with the 
      LC50 and LC90 values of 69.43, 75.13, and 91.41 ppm and 125.49, 134.31, and
      167.14 ppm, respectively. The mean percent hatchability of the eggs was observed 
      after 48 h post treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to
      the concentration of extract and directly proportional to the eggs. All the five 
      solvent extracts showed moderate ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract
      showed the highest ovicidal activity. The methanol extract of E. indica against
      A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus exerted 100 % mortality (zero
      hatchability) at 150, 200, and 250 ppm, respectively. Control eggs showed above
      99.3-100 % hatchability. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h recovery
      period. The plant crude extracts showed dose-dependent mortality. At higher
      concentrations, the adult showed restless movement for some times with abnormal
      wagging and then died. Among the extracts tested, the highest adulticidal
      activity was observed in methanol extract against A. stephensi followed by A.
      aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus with the LD50 and LD90 values of 88.76, 94.09,
      and 119.64 ppm and 160.83, 169.01, and 219.77 ppm, respectively. No mortality was
      recorded in the control. Our data suggest that the crude hexane, benzene,
      chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol solvent extracts of E. indica have the
      potential to be used as an eco-friendly approach for the control of the A.
      stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus.

AB  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in paints, printing
      ink, rubber, paper, cosmetics, sunscreens, car materials, cleaning air products, 
      industrial photocatalytic processes, and decomposing organic matters in
      wastewater due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. The
      present study was conducted to assess the antiparasitic efficacies of synthesized
      TiO2 NPs utilizing leaf aqueous extract of Solanum trilobatum against the adult
      head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Phthiraptera: Pediculidae); larvae
      of cattle tick Hyalomma anatolicum (a.) anatolicum Koch (Acari: Ixodidae), and
      fourth instar larvae of malaria vector Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera:
      Culicidae). The green synthesized TiO2 NPs were analyzed by X-ray diffraction
      (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDX), and Atomic
      force microscopy (AFM). XRD analysis of synthesized TiO2 NPs revealed that the
      particles were in the form of nanocrystals as evidenced by the major peaks at
      2theta values of 27.52 degrees , 36.21 degrees , and 54.43 degrees identified as 
      110, 101, and 211 reflections, respectively. FTIR spectra exhibited a prominent
      peak at 3,466 cm(-1) and showed OH stretching due to the alcoholic group, and the
      OH group may act as a capping agent. SEM images displayed NPs that were
      spherical, oval in shape, individual, and some in aggregates with an average size
      of 70 nm. Characterization of the synthesized TiO2 NPs using AFM offered a
      three-dimensional visualization and uneven surface morphology. The pediculocidal 
      and acaricidal activities of synthesized TiO2 NPs showed the percent mortality of
      31, 42, 63, 82, 100; 36, 44, 67, 89, and 100 at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/L,
      respectively, against P. h. capitis and H. a. anatolicum. The average larval
      percent mortality of synthesized TiO2 NPs was 38, 47, 66, 79, and 100 at 1, 2, 3,
      4, and 5 mg/L, respectively, against A. subpictus. The maximum activity was
      observed in the aqueous leaf extract of S. trilobatum, TiO(OH)2 solutions (bulk),
      and synthesized TiO2 NPs with LC50 values of 35.14, 25.85, and 4.34 mg/L; 47.15, 
      29.78, and 4.11 mg/L; and 28.80, 24.01, and 1.94 mg/L, and r (2) values of 0.982,
      0.991, and 0.992; 0.947, 0.987, and 0.997; and 0.965, 0.998 and 0.985,
      respectively, against P. h. capitis, H. a. anatolicum, and A. subpictus. This
      study provides the first report on the pediculocidal, acaricidal, and larvicidal 
      activity of synthesized TiO2 NPs. This is an ideal eco-friendly, novel, low-cost,
      and simple approach to satisfy the requirement of large-scale industrial
      production bearing the advantage for the control of P. h. capitis, H. a.
      anatolicum, and A. subpictus.

TI  - Altitude, temperature, and malaria vectors in Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar
      districts of Uttarakhand, India: an evidence-based study.
PG  - 220-4
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The relationship between altitude, temperature and
      malaria are poorly understood. Hence, a study was undertaken at three sites of
      Udham Singh Nagar (erstwhile Nainital district) and Nainital district
      (Uttarakhand) during 2010- 11 for the generation of evidences in the context of
      potential threat of climate change. METHODS: Data on temperature and relative
      humidity (RH) were recorded through data-logger device in study villages at the
      altitudes of 166, 226 and 609 m were selected for detailed work. Mosquito
      collections were made fortnightly during 0600- 0800 hrs. Malaria incidence data
      were procured from concerned Primary Health Centres. RESULTS: The study provides 
      evidences of decrease in temperature with increase in altitude, even within a
      district resulting in variation in temporal distribution of malaria vector. With 
      the increase of 67 m altitude between plains and foothill village, there was a
      reduction in temperature to the tune of 1.1 degrees C and with further increase
      in altitude of 416 m between foothill and hilly villages, the temperature
      decreased by 0.27 degrees C. The difference in temperature at three altitudes
      affects the Transmission windows (TWs) of both Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and P.
      falciparum (Pf), and opening of TWs are inversely proportional to altitude. In
      the plains, the TW for Pv and Pf were open for 11 and 10 months respectively,
      while 10 and 9 months in the foothills and 9 and 8 months, respectively for both 
      the parasites at hilly altitude. Comparison of malaria vectors in plains,
      foothills, and hilly villages showed that the availability of Anopheles
      culicifacies and An. fluviatilis decreased with an increase in altitude from
      foothills to hilly areas. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study may be
      extrapolated to know the suitability of occurrence of malaria vectors and
      transmission of parasites at different altitudes from the viewpoint of
      temperature as limiting factor in unknown areas.

TI  - Larvicidal activity and GC-MS analysis of flavonoids of Vitex negundo and
      Andrographis paniculata against two vector mosquitoes Anopheles stephensi and
      Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Development of insect resistance to synthetic
      pesticides, high operational cost and environmental pollution have created the
      need for developing alternative approaches to control vector-borne diseases. In
      the present study, larvicidal activity of flavonoid extracts of different parts
      of Vitex negundo (Linnaeus) and Andrographis paniculata (Nees) have been studied 
      against the late III or early IV instar larvae of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles
      stephensi (Liston). METHODS: Flavonoids were extracted from different parts of
      the selected plants using standard method. Bioassay test was carried out by WHO
      method for determination of larvicidal activity against mosquitoes. Different
      compounds of the most active extract were identified by the gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. RESULTS: Flavonoid extract of 
      whole aerial part of A. paniculata was found to be inactive against the selected 
      larvae of Ae. aegypti even at the concentration of 600 ppm, whereas it caused 70%
      mortality in An. stephensi at the concentration of 200 ppm. Flavonoid extract of 
      flower-buds produced highest mortality (100%) at the concentration of 600 ppm for
      the late III or early IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and at the concentration of
      200 ppm for the larvae of An. stephensi. GC-MS analysis of the most active
      flavonoid extract from flower-buds of Vitex showed 81 peaks. Phenol (26.83%
      area), naphthalene (4.95% area), 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (6.79% area),
      Phenol-2,4-Bis (1,1-dimethyl) (4.49% area), flavones 4'-OH,5-OH,7-di-O-glucoside 
      (0.25% area) and 5-hydroxy- 3,6,7,3',4'-pentamethoxy flavones (0.80% area) were
      present in major amount. CONCLUSION: Flavonoid extracts from different parts of
      two selected plants possess larvicidal activity against two selected mosquito
      species, hence, could be utilized for developing flavonoid-based, eco-friendly
      insecticide as an alternative to synthetic insecticides.

TI  - Population genetic structure of malaria vector Anopheles stephensi Liston
      (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 273-9
AB  - Malaria is a complex disease that afflicts human today. Malaria epidemiology is
      associated with drug resistance in parasite and differential distribution and
      insecticide resistance in vector. Efforts are being made to eradicate malaria but
      burden of malaria is still increasing. Vector control is essential for malaria
      prevention strategies. Knowledge of population genetic structure is pre-requisite
      for determining prevention strategies particularly using transgenic mosquitoes.
      Population genetic study can predict level of gene flow between different
      populations. Anopheles stephensi Liston is urban vector of malaria in
      Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. About 12% of malaria cases of malaria in India are
      contributed by A. stephensi. Studies conducted on population genetics of A.
      stephensi using various markers in different parts of the world are discussed in 
      this communication.

      mosquito control.
PG  - 323-32
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3658-y [doi]
AB  - Entomopathogenic bacteria to control mosquitoes are a promising environmentally
      friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides. In the present study, a novel
      mosquitocidal bacterium was isolated from marine soil collected from east coastal
      areas at Pondicherry (India). 16S rRNA gene sequence alignment depicted that this
      isolate belonged to Bacillus cereus VCRC-B520 (NCBI: KC-119192). Biochemical
      studies on bacterial growth, biomass, and toxin production have revealed that
      this strain could possibly be helpful in the production of a biopesticide in
      mosquito control. Toxicity assay with B. cereus against mosquito larvae has shown
      that the filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus, is more susceptible than the 
      other two species (Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti). The LC50 and LC90
      values for C. quinquefasciatus were 0.30 and 2.21 mg/L, respectively. No effect
      of B. cereus was found on nontargeted organisms. SDS-PAGE analysis and protein
      purification result from the cell mass of B. cereus have shown that a
      well-perceptible polypeptide was the dependable factor (85 kDa) for mosquitocidal
      action. Protein characterization (M/S MALDI-TOF) has shown that it is an
      endotoxin-specific insecticidal protein, namely "Cry4Aa". Phylogenetic analyses
      of 16S rDNA gene sequence from this marine isolate have revealed the presence of 
      homology among closely related Bacillus strains. Therefore, considerable interest
      has been shown on the identification of a potential mosquitocidal bacterium from 
      marine environment (B. cereus), which was not reported earlier in view of the
      current scenario of the rapid development of resistance to Bacillus sphaericus in
      mosquito vector control program.

      India.
PG  - 552-8
AB  - Anopheles minimus is one of the major vectors for transmission of malaria disease
      in north eastern (NE) region of India. The minimus species complex of Minimus
      subgroup of Myzomyia series of anophelines were studied in malaria affected
      states--Assam and Arunachal Pradesh (AP) of NE India. Ribosomal DNA
      markers--second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and third domain (D3) of 28S
      gene were used to characterize An. minimus species. Sequence homogeneity was
      observed in D3 sequences of An.minimus specimens throughout both the states.
      However, a transversion in ITS2 sequence of single specimen collected from
      Assam-Meghalaya border areas illustrates possibility of intra population
      polymorphism in ITS2 sequence within the geographical region.

TI  - Potential of sugarcane bagasse (agro-industrial waste) for the production of
      Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis.
PG  - 504-15
AB  - Sugarcane bagasse is a renewable resource that can be used to produce
      biopesticide for the control of mosquito vectors. In the present study, we
      demonstrated that cane processed bagasse could be used to produce Bacillus
      thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) for control of mosquito vectors viz:
      Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti. Biochemical
      studies indicated that the Bti spore/crystal toxins produced from the test
      culture medium (Bagasse, BG + Soybean, SB) are higher than that from the
      conventional medium (Nutrient Yeast Extract Salt Medium, NYSM). The bacteria
      produced in these media (NYSM, BG, SB, BG+SB) were bioassayed against the
      mosquito species and the toxic effect was found to be effective. Cost-effective
      analysis indicates that the use of BG and SB, as bacterial culture medium, is
      successful and economical, for production of this mosquito pathogenic bacillus.

AB  - Malaria and dengue are the two most important vector-borne human diseases caused 
      by mosquito vectors Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti, respectively. Of the
      various strategies adopted for eliminating these diseases, controlling of vectors
      through herbs has been reckoned as one of the important measures for preventing
      their resurgence. Artemisia annua leaf chloroform extract when tried against
      larvae of A. stephensi and A. aegypti has shown a strong larvicidal activity
      against both of these vectors, their respective LC50 and LC90 values being 0.84
      and 4.91 ppm for A. stephensi and 0.67 and 5.84 ppm for A. aegypti. The crude
      extract when separated through column chromatography using petroleum ether-ethyl 
      acetate gradient (0-100%) yielded 76 fractions which were pooled into three
      different active fractions A, B and C on the basis of same or nearly similar R f 
      values. The aforesaid pooled fractions when assayed against the larvae of A.
      stephensi too reported a strong larvicidal activity. The respective marker
      compound purified from the individual fractions A, B and C, were Artemisinin,
      Arteannuin B and Artemisinic acid, as confirmed and characterized through FT-IR
      and NMR. This is our first report of strong mortality of A. annua leaf chloroform
      extract against vectors of two deadly diseases. This technology can be scaled up 
      for commercial exploitation.

      different and allopatric forms of A. stephensi were studied. Three forms were
      isolated from different regions of southern Iran: the variety mysorensis, the
      intermediate form and the native type form, and an additional type form
      originated from India (Beech strain).The mosquitoes were experimentally infected 
      with P. berghei to compare their susceptibility to parasitism. Anti-mosquito
      midgut antiserum was then raised in BALB/cs mice immunized against gut antigens
      from the most susceptible form of A. stephensi (Beech strain), and the efficacy
      of the antiserum was assessed in transmission-blocking assays conducted on the
      least susceptible mosquito biological form. RESULTS: The susceptibility of
      different biological forms of A. stephensi mosquito to P. berghei was
      specifically inter-type varied. The Beech strain and the intermediate form were
      both highly susceptible to infection, with higher oocyst and sporozoite infection
      rates than intermediate and mysorensis forms. The oocyst infection, and
      particularly sporozite infection, was lowest in the mysorensis strain. Antiserum 
      raised against midgut proteins of the Indian Beech type form blocked infection in
      this mosquito population, but it was ineffective at blocking both oocyst and
      sporozoite development in the permissive but geographically distant intermediate 
      form mosquitoes. This suggests that a strong degree of incompatibility exists
      between the mosquito strains in terms of midgut protein(s) acting as putative
      ookinete receptors. CONCLUSIONS: The incompatibility in the midgut protein
      profiles between two biological forms of A. stephensi demonstrates a
      well-differentiated population structure according to geographical origin.
      Therefore, the design of potential transmission-blocking strategies should
      incorporate a more thorough understanding of intra-species variations in
      host-parasite interactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the larvicidal activity of Catharanthus roseus (C. roseus) 
      leaf extract and Bacillus thuringiensis (B. thuringiensis) against the malarial
      vector Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi), when being used alone or together.
      METHODS: The larvicidal activity was assayed at various concentrations under the 
      laboratory and field conditions. The LC50 and LC90 values of the C. roseus leaf
      extract were determined by probit analysis. RESULTS: The plant extract showed
      larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure; however, the highest larval mortality 
      was found in the petroleum ether extract of C. roseus against the first to fourth
      instars larvae with LC50=3.34, 4.48, 5.90 and 8.17 g/L, respectively; B.
      thuringiensis against the first to fourth instars larvae with LC50=1.72, 1.93,
      2.17 and 2.42 g/L, respectively; and the combined treatment with LC50=2.18, 2.41,
      2.76 and 3.22 g/L, respectively. No mortality was observed in the control.
      CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum ether extract of C. roseus extract and B.
      thuringiensis have potential to be used as ideal eco-friendly agents for the
      control of An. stephensi in vector control programs. The combined treatment with 
      this plant crude extract and bacterial toxin has better larvicidal efficacy
      against An. stephensi.

      against Anopheles stephensi Liston & Aedes aegypti Linn. (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 129-34
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In view of the recently increased interest in developing
      plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticide, this study
      was undertaken to assess the larvicidal and ovicidal potential of the crude
      hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol solvent extracts from the
      medicinal plant Pithecellobium dulce against the mosquito vectors, Anopheles
      stephensi and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). METHODS: Larvicidal activity of
      P. dulce plant extracts was studied in the range of 60 to 450 mg/l against early 
      third instar larvae of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti in the laboratory. The
      larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. The ovicidal activity was
      determined against An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti to various concentrations
      ranging from 100 to 750 mg/l under the laboratory conditions. Mean per cent
      hatchability of the eggs were observed after 48 h post treatment. RESULTS: All
      leaf and seed extracts showed moderate larvicidal and ovicidal effects; however, 
      the highest larval mortality was found in methanol extract of leaf of P. dulce
      against the larvae of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti with the LC(5)(0) and
      LC(9)(0) values 145.43, 155.78 mg/l and 251.23, 279.73 mg/l, respectively. The
      per cent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract 
      and directly proportional to the eggs. Zero hatchability was observed at 400 mg/l
      for leaf methanol extract and 625 mg/l for seed methanol extract of P. dulce
      against An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti, respectively. Compared to leaf extracts,
      seed extracts have low potency against the two mosquitoes. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the leaf and seed extracts of P.
      dulce have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the
      control of mosquitoes.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that are synthesized by using aqueous extracts of
      Solanum nigrum L., is a simple, non-toxic and ecofriendly green material. The
      present study is based on assessments of the larvicidal and antimicrobial
      activities of the synthesized AgNPs from fresh leaves, dry leaves and green
      berries of S. nigrum against larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles
      stephensi and four human pathogenic and five fish pathogenic bacteria
      respectively. The synthesized nanoparticles are characterized with UV-vis
      spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
      (FTIR) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. The nanoparticles are
      spherical to polyhedral in shape with size of 50-100nm (average size of 56.6nm). 
      In larvicidal bioassay with synthesized AgNPs, highest mortality are observed at 
      10ppm against An. stephensi with LC50 values of 1.33, 1.59, 1.56ppm and LC90
      values of 3.97, 7.31, 4.76ppm for dry leaves, fresh leaves and berries
      respectively. Antibacterial activity test reveals better results against fish
      pathogenic bacteria than human pathogenic bacteria. Non target organism like
      Toxorhynchites larvae (mosquito predator), Diplonychus annulatum (predatory
      water-bug) and Chironomus circumdatus larvae (chironomid) are also exposed to
      respective lethal concentrations (to mosquito larvae) of dry nanoparticles and no
      abnormality in the non target organisms are recorded. These results suggest that 
      the synthesized AgNPs of S. nigrum have the potential to be used as an ideal
      eco-friendly compound for the control of the mosquito larvae and harmful
      bacteria.

      India.
PG  - e73730
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0073730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemiological and entomological study was carried out in
      Balaghat district, Madhya Pradesh, India to understand the dynamics of forest
      malaria transmission in a difficult and hard to reach area where indoor residual 
      spray and insecticide treated nets were used for vector control. METHODS: This
      community based cross-sectional study was undertaken from January 2010 to
      December 2012 in Baihar and Birsa Community Health Centres of district Balaghat
      for screening malaria cases. Entomological surveillance included indoor resting
      collections, pyrethrum spray catches and light trap catches. Anophelines were
      assayed by ELISA for detection of Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein. FINDINGS: 
      Plasmodium falciparum infection accounted for >80% of all infections. P. vivax
      16.5%, P. malariae 0.75% and remaining were mixed infections of P. falciparum, P.
      vivax and P. malariae. More than, 30% infections were found in infants under 6
      months of age. Overall, an increasing trend in malaria positivity was observed
      from 2010 to 2012 (chi-square for trend = 663.55; P<0.0001). Twenty five
      Anopheles culicifacies (sibling species C, D and E) were positive for
      circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum (44%) and P. vivax (56%). Additionally,
      2 An. fluviatilis, were found positive for P. falciparum and 1 for P. vivax
      (sibling species S and T). An. fluviatilis sibling species T was found as vector 
      in forest villages for the first time in India. CONCLUSION: These results showed 
      that the study villages are experiencing almost perennial malaria transmission
      inspite of indoor residual spray and insecticide treated nets. Therefore, there
      is a need for new indoor residual insecticides which has longer residual life or 
      complete coverage of population with long lasting insecticide treated nets or
      both indoor residual spray and long lasting bed nets for effective vector
      control. There is a need to undertake a well designed case control study to
      evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.

AB  - The developments of resistance and persistence to chemical insecticides and
      concerns about the non-target effects have prompted the development of
      eco-friendly mosquito control agents. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the larvicidal activities of synthesized cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) using bio 
      control agent, Bacillus thuringiensis against malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus
      and dengue vector, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). The synthesized Co NPs
      were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),
      Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy dispersive X-ray 
      spectroscopy, and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis showed
      three distinct diffraction peaks at 27.03 degrees , 31.00 degrees , and 45.58
      degrees indexed to the planes 102, 122, and 024, respectively on the
      face-centered cubic cobalt acetate with an average size of 85.3 nm. FTIR spectra 
      implicated role of the peak at 3,436 cm(-1) for O-H hydroxyl group, 2924 cm(-1)
      for methylene C-H stretch in the formation of Co NPs. FESEM analysis showed the
      topological and morphological appearance of NPs which were found to be spherical 
      and oval in shape. TEM analysis showed polydispersed and clustered NPs with an
      average size of 84.81 nm. The maximum larvicidal mortality was observed in the
      cobalt acetate solution, B. thuringiensis formulation, and synthesized Co NPs
      against fourth instar larvae of A. subpictus and A. aegypti with LC50 values of
      29.16, 8.12, 3.59 mg/L; 34.61, 6.94, and 2.87 mg/L; r (2) values of 0.986, 0.933,
      0.942; 0.962, 0.957, and 0.922, respectively.

AB  - A novel approach to control strategies for integrated blood-feeding parasite
      management is in high demand, including the use of biological control agents. The
      present study aims to determine the efficacy of optimized crude extract of
      actinomycetes strain LK1 as biological control agent against the fourth-instar
      larvae of Anopheles stephensi and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (Diptera: Culicidae)
      and adults of Haemaphysalis bispinosa, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus
      (Acari: Ixodidae), and Hippobosca maculata (Diptera: Hippoboscidae).
      Antiparasitic activity was optimized using the Plackett-Burman method, and the
      design was developed using the software Design-Expert version 8.0.7.1. The
      production of the optimized crude actinomycetes LK1 strain extract was performed 
      using response surface methodology to optimize the process parameters of protease
      inhibitor activity of marine actinobacteria for the independent variables like
      pH, temperature, glucose, casein, and NaCl at two levels (-1 and +1). The
      potential actinomycetes strain was identified as Saccharomonas spp., and the
      metamodeling surface simulation procedure was followed. It was studied using a
      computer-generated experimental design, automatic control of simulation
      experiments, and sequential optimization of the metamodels fitted to a simulation
      response surface function. The central composite design (CCD) used for the
      analysis of treatment showed that a second-order polynomial regression model was 
      in good agreement with the experimental results at R (2) = 0.9829 (p < 0.05). The
      optimized values of the variables for antioxidant production were pH 6.00,
      glucose 1.3%, casein 0.09%, temperature 31.23 degrees C, and NaCl 0.10%. The LK1 
      strain-optimized crude extract was purified using reversed-phase high-pressure
      liquid chromatography, and the isolated protease inhibitor showed antiparasitic
      activity. The antiparasitic activity of optimized crude extract of LK1 was tested
      against larvae of A. stephensi (LC(5)(0) = 31.82 ppm; r(2) = 0.818) and C.
      tritaeniorhynchus (LC(5)(0) = 26.62 ppm; r(2) = 0.790) and adults of H. bispinosa
      (LC(5)(0) = 106.58 ppm; r(2) = 0.871), R. (B.) microplus (LC(5)(0) = 92.96 ppm;
      r(2) = 0.913), and H. maculata (LC(5)(0) = 84.90 ppm; r(2) = 0.857).

AB  - Mosquitoes act as a vector for most of the life-threatening diseases like
      malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, filariasis, encephalitis,
      West Nile Virus infection, etc. Under the Integrated Mosquito Management,
      emphasis was given on the application of alternative strategies in mosquito
      control. The continuous application of synthetic insecticides causes development 
      of resistance in vector species, biological magnification of toxic substances
      through the food chain, and adverse effects on environmental quality and
      nontarget organisms including human health. Application of active toxic agents
      from plant extracts as an alternative mosquito control strategy was available
      from ancient times. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable prices,
      biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific activities against
      different species of vector mosquitoes. In the present study, the larvicidal
      activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Sida acuta plant leaf 
      extract against late third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles
      stephensi, and Aedes aegypti was determined. Range of concentrations of
      synthesized AgNPs (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mug/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (50,
      100, 150, 200, and 250 mug/mL) were tested against the larvae of C.
      quinquefasciatus, A. stephensi and A. aegypti. The synthesized AgNPs from S.
      acuta leaf were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in three important
      vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
      electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Larvae
      were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous crude extract and synthesized
      AgNPs for 24 h. Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of S.
      acuta for all three important vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of S.
      acuta aqueous leaf extract appeared to be most effective against A. stephensi
      (LC50, 109.94 mug/mL and LC90, 202.42 mug/mL) followed by A. aegypti LC50 (119.32
      mug/mL and LC90, 213.84 mug/mL) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC50, 130.30 mug/mL and 
      LC90, 228.20 mug/mL). Synthesized AgNPs against the vector mosquitoes of A.
      stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90
      values: A. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 21.92, and 41.07 mug/mL; A.
      aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 23.96, and 44.05 mug/mL; C. quinquefasciatus 
      had LC50 and LC90 values of 26.13 and 47.52 mug/mL. These results suggest that
      the use of S. acuta synthesized silver nanoparticles can be a rapid,
      environmentally safer biopesticide which can form a novel approach to develop
      effective biocides for controlling the target vector mosquitoes. This is the
      first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the plant aqueous extract and
      synthesized nanoparticles.

      subpictus complex in Sri Lanka.
PG  - 304
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-304 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato is a major malaria vector in South and
      Southeast Asia. Based initially on polytene chromosome inversion polymorphism,
      and subsequently on morphological characterization, four sibling species A-D were
      reported from India. The present study uses molecular methods to further
      characterize and identify sibling species in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Mosquitoes from 
      Sri Lanka were morphologically identified to species and sequenced for the
      ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS2) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c
      oxidase subunit-I (COI) genes. These sequences, together with others from
      GenBank, were used to construct phylogenetic trees and parsimony haplotype
      networks and to test for genetic population structure. RESULTS: Both ITS2 and COI
      sequences revealed two divergent clades indicating that the Subpictus complex in 
      Sri Lanka is composed of two genetically distinct species that correspond to
      species A and species B from India. Phylogenetic analysis showed that species A
      and species B do not form a monophyletic clade but instead share genetic
      similarity with Anopheles vagus and Anopheles sundaicus s.l., respectively. An
      allele specific identification method based on ITS2 variation was developed for
      the reliable identification of species A and B in Sri Lanka. CONCLUSION: Further 
      multidisciplinary studies are needed to establish the species status of all
      chromosomal forms in the Subpictus complex. This study emphasizes the
      difficulties in using morphological characters for species identification in An. 
      subpictus s.l. in Sri Lanka and demonstrates the utility of an allele specific
      identification method that can be used to characterize the differential
      bio-ecological traits of species A and B in Sri Lanka.

TI  - Effect of land use and land cover modification on distribution of anopheline
      larval habitats in Meghalaya, India.
PG  - 121-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The Meghalaya region had been considered free of
      malaria, but recently malaria cases in the foothills and valley areas raised
      concern that malaria transmission at high elevations may be increasing. This
      increase is associated with land use and land cover (LULC) changes. This LULC
      directly modifies larval habitats and affect the anopheline larval distribution
      patterns. METHODS: In this survey, effects of LULC changes on the distribution of
      anopheline larval habitats in Meghalaya over a three year period (April 2008 to
      March 2011) was observed. Mosquito density and diversity of neighbouring four
      villages located along natural swamps (less disturbed) were compared with 16
      villages located near disturbed area (cultivated area, urban area, pastures land 
      area and national highway area). RESULTS: The association between LULC type and
      occurrence of anopheline larvae was statistically significant. The distribution
      of anopheline positive habitats varied significantly between seasons. The mean
      density of Anopheles was significantly higher in urban area in all the seasons,
      but higher in farm land and pasture land areas only in rainy and post-rainy
      seasons. The six most common species collected were Anopheles maculatus (19.2%), 
      An. vagus (13.7%), An. annularis (9.1%), An. philippinensis (8.1%), An.
      barbirostris (5.1%) and An. minimus (4.6%). LULC changes occurred mainly in
      valleys and National Highway Development Programme Phase III site. Overall, open 
      forest area, farm land area and national highway development project phase area
      were observed to increase by 2.9, 1.7, and 2.1% respectively. INTERPRETATION AND 
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that LULC changes in the study area were
      favourable to Anopheles larval development, increasing the risk of the spread of 
      malaria vector habitats and malaria transmission to non-malarious regions of
      Meghalaya.

TI  - Mosquito larval source management for controlling malaria.
PG  - CD008923
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008923.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important cause of illness and death in people living
      in many parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Long-lasting
      insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduce
      malaria transmission by targeting the adult mosquito vector and are key
      components of malaria control programmes. However, mosquito numbers may also be
      reduced by larval source management (LSM), which targets mosquito larvae as they 
      mature in aquatic habitats. This is conducted by permanently or temporarily
      reducing the availability of larval habitats (habitat modification and habitat
      manipulation), or by adding substances to standing water that either kill or
      inhibit the development of larvae (larviciding). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
      effectiveness of mosquito LSM for preventing malaria. SEARCH METHODS: We searched
      the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CABS Abstracts; and
      LILACS up to 24 October 2012. We handsearched the Tropical Diseases Bulletin from
      1900 to 2010, the archives of the World Health Organization (up to 11 February
      2011), and the literature database of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (up 
      to 2 March 2011). We also contacted colleagues in the field for relevant
      articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included cluster randomized controlled trials
      (cluster-RCTs), controlled before-and-after trials with at least one year of
      baseline data, and randomized cross-over trials that compared LSM with no LSM for
      malaria control. We excluded trials that evaluated biological control of
      anopheline mosquitoes with larvivorous fish. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At
      least two authors assessed each trial for eligibility. We extracted data and at
      least two authors independently determined the risk of bias in the included
      studies. We resolved all disagreements through discussion with a third author. We
      analyzed the data using Review Manager 5 software. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13
      studies; four cluster-RCTs, eight controlled before-and-after trials, and one
      randomized cross-over trial. The included studies evaluated habitat modification 
      (one study), habitat modification with larviciding (two studies), habitat
      manipulation (one study), habitat manipulation plus larviciding (two studies), or
      larviciding alone (seven studies) in a wide variety of habitats and countries.
      Malaria incidenceIn two cluster-RCTs undertaken in Sri Lanka, larviciding of
      abandoned mines, streams, irrigation ditches, and rice paddies reduced malaria
      incidence by around three-quarters compared to the control (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.22 
      to 0.31, 20,124 participants, two trials, moderate quality evidence). In three
      controlled before-and-after trials in urban and rural India and rural Kenya,
      results were inconsistent (98,233 participants, three trials, very low quality
      evidence). In one trial in urban India, the removal of domestic water containers 
      together with weekly larviciding of canals and stagnant pools reduced malaria
      incidence by three quarters. In one trial in rural India and one trial in rural
      Kenya, malaria incidence was higher at baseline in intervention areas than in
      controls. However dam construction in India, and larviciding of streams and
      swamps in Kenya, reduced malaria incidence to levels similar to the control
      areas. In one additional randomized cross-over trial in the flood plains of the
      Gambia River, where larval habitats were extensive and ill-defined, larviciding
      by ground teams did not result in a statistically significant reduction in
      malaria incidence (2039 participants, one trial). Parasite prevalenceIn one
      cluster-RCT from Sri Lanka, larviciding reduced parasite prevalence by almost 90%
      (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22, 2963 participants, one trial, moderate quality
      evidence). In five controlled before-and-after trials in Greece, India, the
      Philippines, and Tanzania, LSM resulted in an average reduction in parasite
      prevalence of around two-thirds (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55, 8041 participants,
      five trials, moderate quality evidence). The interventions in these five trials
      included dam construction to reduce larval habitats, flushing of streams, removal
      of domestic water containers, and larviciding. In the randomized cross-over trial
      in the flood plains of the Gambia River, larviciding by ground teams did not
      significantly reduce parasite prevalence (2039 participants, one trial). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: In Africa and Asia, LSM is another policy option, alongside LLINs
      and IRS, for reducing malaria morbidity in both urban and rural areas where a
      sufficient proportion of larval habitats can be targeted. Further research is
      needed to evaluate whether LSM is appropriate or feasible in parts of rural
      Africa where larval habitats are more extensive.

      carbofuran and a/+ (41C-43B) in neem strains, were reported. No inversions were
      observed in X chromosome so far. The frequency of inversions in different
      insecticides was found to be highest in the 2R arm, followed by the 3R arm. Such 
      inversions were not reported in the corresponding susceptible strains or in the
      parental stocks.

AB  - The two components (BinA and BinB) of Lysinibacillus sphaericus binary toxin
      together are highly toxic to Culex and Anopheles mosquito larvae, and have been
      employed world-wide to control mosquito borne diseases. Upon binding to the
      membrane receptor an oligomeric form (BinA2.BinB2) of the binary toxin is
      expected to play role in pore formation. It is not clear if these two proteins
      interact in solution as well, in the absence of receptor. The interactions
      between active forms of BinA and BinB polypeptides were probed in solution using 
      size-exclusion chromatography, pull-down assay, surface plasmon resonance,
      circular dichroism, and by chemically crosslinking BinA and BinB components. We
      demonstrate that the two proteins interact weakly with first association and
      dissociation rate constants of 4.5x10(3) M(-1) s(-1) and 0.8 s(-1), resulting in 
      conformational change, most likely, in toxic BinA protein that could kinetically 
      favor membrane translocation of the active oligomer. The weak interactions
      between the two toxin components could be stabilized by glutaraldehyde
      crosslinking. The cross-linked complex, interestingly, showed maximal Culex
      larvicidal activity (LC50 value of 1.59 ng mL(-1)) reported so far for
      combination of BinA/BinB components, and thus is an attractive option for
      development of new bio-pesticides for control of mosquito borne vector diseases.

TI  - Study of thrombocytopenia in patients of malaria.
PG  - 58-61
LID - 10.4103/2229-5070.113914 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a Protozoal disease caused by infection with parasites of 
      the genus Plasmodium and transmitted to man by certain species of infected female
      Anopheline mosquito. In 2008 there were 1.52 million cases of malaria in India,
      out of which 0.76 million case of Plasmodium falciparum, comprising 50% of total 
      malaria cases. There were 924 deaths from malaria. Hematological abnormalities
      have been observed in patients with malaria, with anemia, and thrombocytopenia
      being the most common. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted this study to find out
      the frequency and the degree of thrombocytopenia in patients with malaria. In our
      study, 230 patients with malaria positive were investigated with platelet count. 
      RESULTS: In the study group of 230 patients: 130 (56.51%) were positive for
      Plasmodium vivax, 90 (39.13%) were positive for P. falciparum and 10 (4.34%) had 
      mixed infection with both P. vivax and P. falciparum. Out of 130 cases detected
      with vivax malaria, 100 cases had thrombocytopenia. Out of 90 cases detected with
      falciparum malaria, 70 cases had thrombocytopenia. Among 10 cases of mixed
      infection, 9 cases had thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of
      thrombocytopenia in a patient with acute febrile illness in the tropics increases
      the possibility of malaria. The above finding can have therapeutic implications
      in context of avoiding unnecessary platelet infusion in malaria patients.

AB  - The biological activity of essential oil extracted from the leaves of Polygonum
      hydropiper and a compound, confertifolin, isolated from this plant was bioassayed
      against larva of mosquitoes, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. The 
      essential oil showed the LC50 values of 189 and 243ppm; 217 and 242ppm,
      confertifolin
      (6,6,9a-trimethyl-4,5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a-octahydronaphtho[1,2-c]furan-3(1H)-one)
      showed the LC50 values of 2.40 and 3.09ppm; 4.07 and 4.18ppm against the second
      and fourth instar larvae of An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively.
      At 10ppm confertifolin showed ovicidal activity of 100, 98.6 and 86.4% against
      An. stephensi and 100, 100 and 75.2% against Cx. quinquefasciatus on 0-6, 6-12
      and 12-18h old eggs; the repellent activity persisted for 314.6 and 319.0min;
      oviposition deterrent activity was 97.2 and 99% and adulticidal activity was 100 
      and 100% against An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The
      results were statistically significant. Confertifolin could be considered for use
      in the control of human vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Malaria parasite-synthesized heme is essential in the mosquito and liver stages
      and complements host heme in the blood stages of infection.
PG  - e1003522
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003522 [doi]
AB  - Heme metabolism is central to malaria parasite biology. The parasite acquires
      heme from host hemoglobin in the intraerythrocytic stages and stores it as
      hemozoin to prevent free heme toxicity. The parasite can also synthesize heme de 
      novo, and all the enzymes in the pathway are characterized. To study the role of 
      the dual heme sources in malaria parasite growth and development, we knocked out 
      the first enzyme, delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), and the last enzyme,
      ferrochelatase (FC), in the heme-biosynthetic pathway of Plasmodium berghei (Pb).
      The wild-type and knockout (KO) parasites had similar intraerythrocytic growth
      patterns in mice. We carried out in vitro radiolabeling of heme in Pb-infected
      mouse reticulocytes and Plasmodium falciparum-infected human RBCs using [4-(14)C]
      aminolevulinic acid (ALA). We found that the parasites incorporated both host
      hemoglobin-heme and parasite-synthesized heme into hemozoin and mitochondrial
      cytochromes. The similar fates of the two heme sources suggest that they may
      serve as backup mechanisms to provide heme in the intraerythrocytic stages.
      Nevertheless, the de novo pathway is absolutely essential for parasite
      development in the mosquito and liver stages. PbKO parasites formed drastically
      reduced oocysts and did not form sporozoites in the salivary glands. Oocyst
      production in PbALASKO parasites recovered when mosquitoes received an ALA
      supplement. PbALASKO sporozoites could infect mice only when the mice received an
      ALA supplement. Our results indicate the potential for new therapeutic
      interventions targeting the heme-biosynthetic pathway in the parasite during the 
      mosquito and liver stages.

      (Diptera: Culicidae).

AB  - Diseases transmitted by blood-feeding mosquitoes, such as dengue fever, dengue
      hemorrhagic fever, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, and filariasis, are increasing
      in prevalence, particularly in tropical and subtropical zones. To control
      mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases, which have a worldwide health and
      economic impacts, synthetic insecticide-based interventions are still necessary, 
      particularly in situations of epidemic outbreak and sudden increases of adult
      mosquitoes. However, the indiscriminate use of conventional insecticides is
      fostering multifarious problems like widespread development of insecticide
      resistance, toxic hazards to mammals, undesirable effects on nontarget organisms,
      and environmental pollution. The aim of this research was to evaluate the
      toxicity of mosquito larvicidal activity of essential oil from Coleus aromaticus 
      and its pure isolated constituent thymol against larvae of Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles subpictus. The chemical
      composition of the essential oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectroscopy. A total of 14 components of the essential oil of C. aromaticus were
      identified. The major chemical components identified were thymol (82.68%),
      terpinen-4-ol (3.2%), and trans-Caryophyllene (3.18%). Twenty-five early third
      instar larvae of C. tritaeniorhynchus, A. albopictus, and A. subpictus were
      exposed and assayed in the laboratory. Thymol and essential oil were tested in
      concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 and 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 ppm,
      respectively. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of treatment. The
      thymol had a significant toxic effect against early third-stage larvae of C.
      tritaeniorhynchus, A. albopictus, and A. subpictus with an LC50 values of 28.19, 
      24.83, and 22.06 mug/mL respectively, whereas the essential oil of C. aromaticus 
      had an LC50 values of 72.70, 67.98, and 60.31 mug/mL, respectively. No mortality 
      was observed in controls. The Chi-square values were significant at p < 0.05
      level. The result indicated that the essential oil of C. aromaticus and the
      isolated constituent have a potential for use in control of C. tritaeniorhynchus,
      A. albopictus, and A. subpictus larvae and could be useful in search of newer,
      safer, and more effective natural compounds as larvicides.

AB  - Dirofilariasis is a zoonotic infection caused by filarial nematodes belonging to 
      the genus dirofilariae. Dirofilaria is commonly seen in dogs, cats and other
      carnivorous animals world wide. Mosquitoes of the genus Culex, Anopheles and
      Aedes are the vectors and the humans are either incidental hosts or dead-end
      hosts. It affects lungs, liver and other visceral organs. Ocular involvement is
      rarely been reported. We present a case of 51-year-old female from Kerala, the
      southern State of India presented with a mass mimicking lacrimal sac mucocoele
      whose biopsy is proved to be dirofilariasis.

TI  - Alteration in Bacillus thuringiensis toxicity by curing gut flora: novel approach
      for mosquito resistance management.
PG  - 3283-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3507-z [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes are known for acquiring resistance against insecticides in many ways, 
      namely target side mutation, enzyme modification, sequestration, quick
      elimination, etc. But, the role of microflora present in abundance in the larval 
      midgut is less explored with respect to their role in insecticide resistance.
      During the course of their development, mosquitoes are continuously exposed to
      microbes and have naturally acquired midgut microbial flora. This midgut flora
      can modulate the mosquito's susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
      infection by degrading toxic Bt protein forms through an unknown mechanism. In
      this study, we show that microbe-free aseptic mosquito larvae displayed an
      increased susceptibility to Bt toxicity compared to larvae harboring natural
      microbial flora. Fourth instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi were treated
      separately with penicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin (100 mug/ml), and mixtures
      of all three antibiotics and then analyzed for Bt toxicity. We have also examined
      the influence of the mosquito's midgut microbial flora under microaerophilic
      condition on the Bt protein degradation through plate, broth, TLC, and UV-vis
      spectrophotometric assay. A better understanding of the roles of microbiota in
      preventing Bt toxicity to mosquitoes could potentially lead to the development of
      new sustainable mosquito control strategies.

TI  - Comparative susceptibilities of species T and U of the Anopheles fluviatilis
      complex to Plasmodium vinckei petteri sporogony.
PG  - 594-7
AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis James is an important malaria vector in Indian
      subcontinent. An. fluviatilis exists as a complex of three sibling species, of
      which two species, T and U, have been colonized so far. Attempts were made to
      study the comparative susceptibility of species T and U of the An. fluviatilis
      complex to rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium vinckei petteri by using Anopheles 
      stephensi Liston as calibrator for variable infectivity in different isolates.
      An. stephensi, which was used as control, became readily infected, with 60-65%
      mosquitoes carrying developing oocysts, whereas in species T and species U,
      approximately 50 and 63%, respectively, of mosquitoes carried oocyts. An.
      fluviatilis species T was found comparatively less susceptible to P. v. petteri
      sporogonic development compared with species U. Moreover, significantly lesser
      sporozoites rate (11%) was observed in species T compared with 31% in species U. 
      Species T and species U are not considered as malaria vectors in India in the
      field. However, in the laboratory, both these species are able to support the
      malaria sporogony.

AB  - The midgut of parasite transmitting vector, Anopheles stephensi is a
      physiologically dynamic ecological niche of resident microbes. The gut resident
      microbes of anisomorphic and physiologically variable male and female A.
      stephensi mosquitoes were different (Rani et al., 2009). To understand the
      possible interaction of gut microbes and mosquito host, we examined the
      contribution of the microbe community on the fitness of the adult mosquitoes and 
      their ability to permit development of the malaria parasite. A. stephensi
      mosquitoes were fed with antibiotic to sterilize their gut to study longevity,
      blood meal digestion, egg laying and maturation capacity, and consequently
      ability to support malaria parasite development. The sterilization of gut
      imparted reduction in longevity by a median of 5 days in male and 2 days in
      female mosquitoes. Similarly, the sterilization also diminished the reproductive 
      potential probably due to increased rate of the resorption of follicles in
      ovaries coupled with abated blood meal digestion in gut-sterilized females.
      Additionally, gut sterilization also led to increased susceptibility to oocyst
      development upon feeding on malaria infected blood. The susceptibility to malaria
      parasite introduced upon gut sterilization of A. stephensi was restored
      completely upon re-colonization of gut by native microbes. The information
      provided in the study provides insights into the role of the gut-resident
      microbial community in various life events of the mosquito that may be used to
      develop alternate malaria control strategies, such as paratransgenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the larvicidal and pupicidal activities of aqueous,
      ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Catharanthus roseus (C. roseus) against
      malaria and filariasis vectors. METHODS: The larvicidal and pupicidal activities 
      of C. roseus leaf extracts were tested against the fourth instar larvae and pupae
      of Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx.
      quinquefasciatus). The mortality was observed after 24 and 48 h post the
      treatment. The data were subjected to probit analysis to determine the lethal
      concentrations (LC50 and LC90) at which 50% and 90% of the treated larvae or
      pupae of the tested species were killed. RESULTS: The larval and pupal mortality 
      were observed after 24 and 48 h of exposure of aqueous, ethyl acetate and
      methanol extracts of C. roseus; no mortality was observed in the control group.
      The LC50 values against the fourth-instar larvae of An. stephensi were 68.62 and 
      72.04 mg/mL for the aqueous extract, 82.47 mg/mL for the ethyl acetate extract,
      and 78.80 and 86.64 mg/mL for the methanol extract, while the aqueous, ethyl
      acetate and methanol extracts had LC50 values of 85.21, 76.84 and 94.20 mg/mL
      against the fourth-instar larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus. The aqueous, ethyl
      acetate and methanol extracts had LC50 values of 118.08, 182.47 and 143.80 mg/mL 
      against the pupae of An. stephensi and 146.20, 226.84 and 156.62 mg/mL against
      the pupae of Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The aqueous and
      methanol extracts of C. roseus leaves had an excellent potential to control the
      malarial vector An. stephensi and filariasis vector Cx. quinquefasciatus.

AB  - India reports the highest number of malaria cases in Southeast Asia, of which
      Plasmodium falciparum contribute more than half of the cases every year. North
      eastern states of India contribute only 3.96% of country's population but account
      for >10% of total reported malaria cases, 11% of Plasmodium falciparum cases and 
      20% of malaria related deaths annually. In India, chloroquine resistance was
      reported for the first time from northeast region and since then chloroquine
      treatment failure is being reported from many parts of the region. Increased
      chloroquine treatment failure has led to change of the drug policy to artemisinin
      combination therapy as first line of malaria treatment in the region. However,
      replacing chloroquine to artemisinin combination therapy has not shown
      significant difference in the overall malaria incidence in the region. The
      present review addresses the current malaria situation of northeastern region of 
      India in the light of antimalarials drug resistance.

      A using microsatellite markers.
PG  - 166

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato is an important vector of malaria
      in Southeast Asia contributing to almost 70% of malaria cases in India. It exists
      as morphologically similar sibling species A, B, C, D and E with varied
      geographical distribution patterns. Vector control measures have been difficult
      for this important vector as the sibling species have developed varying levels of
      resistance to the currently used insecticides. In view of the importance of this 
      vector, we developed and validated a set of microsatellite markers and the same
      were used to analyze the population genetic structure of five different
      geographical populations of An. culicifacies A. METHODS: Anopheles culicifacies A
      samples were collected from different localities across India, and genotyping was
      performed using eight microsatellite markers on ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer.
      Several statistical analyses were performed to ascertain the genetic diversity
      that exists within and between the populations. RESULTS: The markers were found
      to be moderately polymorphic in the populations. Genetic analysis indicated
      significant genetic differentiation between the majority of the population pairs 
      analyzed and was not found to be related to the geographical distances between
      populations. CONCLUSION: This is the first and successful attempt to test the
      microsatellite markers developed for population genetic analysis of An.
      culicifacies A. Host feeding and breeding habits of species A suggest that
      factors other than ecological and geographical barriers were responsible for the 
      genetic differentiation that has been observed between the populations.

      Culicidae).
PG  - 27-35
AB  - The extracts of liver (LE), ovary (OE), skin (SE) and muscle (ME) tissues of four
      species of puffer fishes viz., Arothron hispidus, Lagocephalus inermis,
      Lagocephalus scleratus and Chelonodon patoca were evaluated against larvae and
      eggs of three mosquito vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and
      Aedes aegypti. The LC50 values were 1194.26, 1382.73 (LE); 1421.42, 1982.73 (OE);
      7116.86, 15038.98 (ME) and 10817.8 ppm (SE) for An. stephensi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus respectively for A. hispidus. In the case of L. inermis, the
      LC50 values were 1163.83, 1556.1 and 2426.38 (LE); 1653.53, 2734.74 (OE); 6067.47
      (ME) and 10283.04 ppm (SE) for An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae.
      aegypti respectively. The LC50 values were 1509.98, 1608.69 (LE) and 1414.9,
      2278.69 ppm (OE) for An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus respectively for the 
      extracts of L. scleratus. In the case C. patoca extracts the LC50 values were
      1182.29, 1543.00, 2441.03 (LE) and 1076.13, 2582.11 ppm (OE) for An. stephensi,
      Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti respectively. OE and LE of all puffer fishes
      exhibited zero percent egg hatchability from 600 to 1000 ppm against eggs of An. 
      stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus. This study shows that puffer toxins are
      effective in killing the larvae and eggs of mosquitoes.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of Anopheles stephensi embryo using expressed sequence
      tags.
PG  - 301-9
AB  - Germ band retraction (GBR) stage is one of the important stages during insect
      development. It is associated with an extensive epithelial morphogenesis and may 
      also be pivotal in generation of morphological diversity in insects. Despite its 
      importance, only a handful of studies report the transcriptome repertoire of this
      stage in insects. Here, we report generation, annotation and analysis of ESTs
      from the embryonic stage (16-22 h post fertilization) of laboratoryreared
      Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. A total of 1002 contigs were obtained upon
      clustering of 1140 high-quality ESTs, which demonstrates an astonishingly low
      transcript redundancy (12.1 percent). Putative functions were assigned only to
      213 contigs (21 percent), comprising mainly of transcripts encoding protein
      synthesis machinery. Approximately 78 percent of the transcripts remain
      uncharacterized, illustrating a lack of sequence information about the genes
      expressed in the embryonic stages of mosquitoes. This study highlights several
      novel transcripts, which apart from insect development, may significantly
      contribute to the essential biological complexity underlying insect viability in 
      adverse environments. Nonetheless, the generated sequence information from this
      work provides a comprehensive resource for genome annotation, microarray
      development, phylogenetic analysis and other molecular biology applications in
      entomology.

AB  - Forty-two Bacillus sphaericus strains were isolated from soil around Tamil Nadu, 
      India. The phylogenetic relationship among the B. sphaericus isolates was
      analysed by REP-PCR and multiplex PCR was performed for the detection of mosquito
      larvicidal genes binA, binB, mtx1, mtx2 and mtx3 in B. sphaericus isolates.
      According to the REP-PCR band pattern, B. sphaericus isolates were divided into
      group A comprising I-XI clusters and group B comprising cluster XII. Three of the
      isolates BSTN01, 23 and 24 were gathered under cluster XII showed a high level of
      larvicidal activity against Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi, the
      other 39 isolates grouped under I-XI clusters were non-toxic or weak or
      moderately toxic to mosquito larvae. Even though BSTN23 and 24 were isolated from
      the same location and both contained all the five mosquito larvicidal genes,
      their intraspecies difference was clearly elucidated by REP-PCR analysis. Among
      high toxic isolates, BSTN23 and 24 were observed to contain all the five toxin
      genes and BSTN01 showed the presence of binary toxin and Mtx1 toxin genes. The
      isolates BSTN02, 03, 07, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 25, 31, 36 and 39 were found to
      contain mtx1 gene with combination of mtx2 and/or mtx3 showed moderate or low
      toxicity against mosquito larvae. binA, binB and mtx1 genes were not present in
      non-toxic isolates. The present study revealed the genetic heterogeneity between 
      both toxic and non-toxic isolates and indicates that there is a good correlation 
      between the presence of toxin genes and toxicity of the strains. These techniques
      could be developed in screening of novel highly toxic B. sphaericus strains from 
      environment without bioassay on mosquito larvae.

      of Anopheles culicifacies E and its vectorial role in malaria transmission.
PG  - 810-21
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the Anopheles culicifacies sibling species complex and
      study their vectorial role in malaria endemic regions of Odisha. METHODS:
      Mosquitoes were collected from 6 malaria endemic districts using standard
      entomological collection methods. An. culicifacies sibling species were
      identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cytochrome oxidase 
      subunit II (COII) region of mitochondrial DNA. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
      sporozoite rate and human blood fed percentage (HBF) were estimated by PCR using 
      Pf- and human-specific primers. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were
      performed to confirm the type of sibling species of An. culicifacies found in
      Odisha. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR detected An. culicifacies sibling species A, B, C,
      D and E in the malaria endemic regions of Odisha. An. culicifacies E was detected
      for the first time in Odisha, which was further confirmed by molecular
      phylogenetics. Highest sporozoite rate and HBF percentage were observed in An.
      culicifacies E in comparison with other sibling species. An. culicifacies E
      collected from Nawarangapur, Nuapara and Keonjhar district showed high HBF
      percentage and sporozoite rates. CONCLUSION: An. culicifacies B was the most
      abundant species, followed by An. culicifacies C and E. High sporozoite rate and 
      HBF of An. culicifacies E indicated that it plays an important role in malaria
      transmission in Odisha. Appropriate control measures against An. culicifacies E
      at an early stage are needed to prevent further malaria transmission in Odisha.

      observation, the plant crude extracts gave protection against mosquito bites
      without any allergic reaction to the test person, and also, the repellent
      activity was dependent on the strength of the plant extracts. The tested plant
      crude extracts had exerted promising repellent against all the three mosquitoes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: From the results it can be concluded the crude extract of C.
      halicacabum was potential for controlling Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and
      An. stephensi mosquitoes.

TI  - Autosomal inheritance of alphamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, resistance in
      Anopheles stephensi-Liston, a malaria mosquito.
PG  - 547-54
LID - 10.1017/S0007485313000102 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles stephensi-Liston (Culicidae: Diptera) is an important urban malarial
      vector in the Indian sub-continent, accounting for about 15% of the total annual 
      malaria incidence. Chemical control represents a key strategy in the management
      of this insect vector. However, owing to erratic and continuous application of
      insecticides, resistance has become a common phenomenon among them and their
      control has become an uphill task. The genetics of alphamethrin, a synthetic
      pyrethroid resistance was studied to determine its mode of inheritance. The late 
      third instar larvae were selectively inbred for 27 and ten generations to
      synthesize homozygous resistant (R) and susceptible (S) stocks, respectively, to 
      the diagnostic dose of 0.12 mg l-1. The log-dosage probit mortality relationships
      and degree of dominance (D) were calculated. Resistance was observed in both
      sexes, the dosage-mortality (d-m) line of F 1 was towards the resistant parent
      and the 'D' value was found to be 0.8 indicating alphamethrin resistant (amr)
      gene to be autosomal and incompletely dominant. The d-m lines of F 2/backcross
      exhibited a clear plateau of mortality across a range of doses indicating
      monogenic resistance. The null hypothesis for monogenic resistance was tested
      from mortality data of backcross progeny compared with theoretical expectations
      using the chi2 test and was found to be non-significant. Understanding genetics
      of insecticide resistance is significant in prediction and management of
      resistant insects. The amr genes can be used as genetic marker in A. stephensi,
      which can be used in several applications in conducting basic and applied genetic
      research.

TI  - Computational approach for identification of Anopheles gambiae miRNA involved in 
      modulation of host immune response.
PG  - 281-91
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0183-5 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play key roles in regulating
      gene expression in animals, plants, and viruses, which involves in biological
      processes including development, cancer, immunity, and host-microorganism
      interactions. In this present study, we have used the computational approach to
      identify potent miRNAs involved in Anopheles gambiae immune response. Analysis of
      217,261 A. gambiae ESTs and further study of RNA folding revealed six new miRNAs.
      The minimum free energy of the predicted miRNAs ranged from -27.2 to -62.63
      kcal/mol with an average of -49.38 kcal/mol. While its A + U % ranges from 50 to 
      65 % with an average value of 57.37 %. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted
      miRNAs revealed that aga-miR-277 was evolutionary highly conserved with more
      similarity with other mosquito species. Observing further the target
      identification of the predicted miRNA, it was noticed that the aga-miR-2304 and
      aga-miR-2390 are involved in modulation of immune response by targeting the gene 
      encoding suppressin and protein prophenoloxidase. Further detailed studies of
      these miRNAs will help in revealing its function in modulation of A. gambiae
      immune response with respect to its parasite.

TI  - Characterizing microclimate in urban malaria transmission settings: a case study 
      from Chennai, India.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-84 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental temperature is an important driver of malaria
      transmission dynamics. Both the parasite and vector are sensitive to mean ambient
      temperatures and daily temperature variation. To understand transmission ecology,
      therefore, it is important to determine the range of microclimatic temperatures
      experienced by malaria vectors in the field. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted
      in the Indian city of Chennai to determine the temperature variation in urban
      microclimates and characterize the thermal ecology of the local transmission
      setting. Temperatures were measured in a range of probable indoor and outdoor
      resting habitats of Anopheles stephensi in two urban slum malaria sites. Mean
      temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations in local transmission sites were 
      compared with standard temperature measures from the local weather station. The
      biological implications of the different temperatures were explored using
      temperature-dependent parasite development models to provide estimates of the
      extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. 
      RESULTS: Mean daily temperatures within the urban transmission sites were
      generally warmer than those recorded at the local weather station. The main
      reason was that night-time temperatures were higher (and hence diurnal
      temperature ranges smaller) in the urban settings. Mean temperatures and
      temperature variation also differed between specific resting sites within the
      transmission environments. Most differences were of the order of 1-3 degrees C
      but were sufficient to lead to important variation in predicted EIPs and hence,
      variation in estimates of transmission intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Standard estimates
      of environmental temperature derived from local weather stations do not
      necessarily provide realistic measures of temperatures within actual transmission
      environments. Even the small differences in mean temperatures or diurnal
      temperature ranges reported in this study can lead to large variations in key
      mosquito and/or parasite life history traits that determine transmission
      intensity. Greater effort should be directed at quantifying adult mosquito
      resting behaviour and determining the temperatures actually experienced by
      mosquitoes and parasites in local transmission environments. In the absence of
      such highly resolved data, the approach used in the current study provides a
      framework for improved thermal characterization of transmission settings.

TI  - Bionomics and vectorial capacity of Anopheles annularis with special reference to
      India: a review.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Anopheles annularis is widely distributed mosquito species all over the country. 
      An. annularis has been incriminated as a malaria vector in India, Sri Lanka,
      Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and China. In India, it has been
      reported to play an important role in malaria transmission as a secondary vector 
      in certain parts of Assam, West Bengal and U.P. In Odisha and some neighbouring
      countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar it has been recognised as a
      primary vector of malaria. This is a species complex of two sibling species A and
      B but the role of these sibling species in malaria transmission is not clearly
      known. An. annularis is resistant to DDT and dieldrin/HCH and susceptible to
      malathion and synthetic pyrethorides in most of the parts of India. In view of
      rapid change in ecological conditions, further studies are required on the
      bionomics of An. annularis and its role in malaria transmission in other parts of
      the country. Considering the importance of An. annularis as a malaria vector, the
      bionomics and its role in malaria transmission has been reviewed in this paper.
      In this communication, an attempt has been made to review its bionomics and its
      role as malaria vector. An. annularis is a competent vector of malaria, thus, due
      attention should be paid for its control under the vector control programmes
      specially in border states where it is playing a primary role in malaria
      transmission.

TI  - DNA Barcodes indicate members of the Anopheles fluviatilis (Diptera: Culicidae)
      species complex to be conspecific in India.
PG  - 354-61
LID - 10.1111/1755-0998.12076 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis, a major vector of malaria in India has been described as a
      complex of three sibling species members, named as S, T and U, based on
      variations in chromosomal inversions. Also, ribosomal DNA markers (repetitive
      Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and 28S D3 region) were described to
      differentiate these three sibling species members. However, controversies prevail
      on the genetic isolation status of these cryptic species. Hence, we evaluated
      this taxonomic incongruence employing DNA barcoding, the well established
      methodology for species identification, using 60 An. fluviatilis sensu lato
      specimens, collected from two malaria endemic eastern states of India. These
      specimens were also subjected to sibling species characterization by ITS2 and D3 
      DNA markers. The former marker identified 31 specimens among these as An.
      fluviatilis S and 21 as An. fluviatilis T. Eight specimens amplified DNA
      fragments specific for both S and T. The D3 marker characterized 39 specimens
      belonging to species S and 21 to species T. Neither marker identified species U. 
      Neighbor Joining analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene 1 sequences 
      (the DNA barcode) categorized all the 60 specimens into a single operational
      taxonomic unit, their Kimura 2 parameter (K2P) genetic variability being only
      0.8%. The genetic differentiation (FST ) and gene flow (Nm ) estimates were
      0.00799 and 62.07, respectively, indicating these two 'species' (S & T) as
      genetically con-specific intermixing populations with negligible genetic
      differentiation. Earlier investigations have refuted the existence of species U. 
      Also, this study demonstrated that An. fluviatilis and the closely related An.
      minimus could be taxonomically differentiated by the DNA Barcode approach (K2P = 
      5.0%).

      factors that influence the viability of medically important mosquito vectors
      during microinjection. METHODS: Three mosquito vectors belonging to the genus
      Aedes, Anopheles and Culex were microinjected at different developmental stages
      of their life cycle viz., egg, larvae, pupae and adult. RESULTS: The
      improvisations revealed an increased survivability of biomanipulated mosquitoes
      during the embryonic and adult microinjection. The study of injecting larvae and 
      pupae resulted in poor survivability. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The
      microinjection protocol was successfully tested on three important mosquito
      vectors. The critical period after biomanipulation which contributes heavily for 
      the survivability factor was evaluated. The results provide a common protocol for
      biomanipulation of three mosquito vectors with enhanced survivability.

TI  - Battling malaria iceberg incorporating strategic reforms in achieving Millennium 
      Development Goals & malaria elimination in India.
PG  - 907-25
AB  - Malaria control in India has occupied high priority in health sector consuming
      major resources of the Central and State governments. Several new initiatives
      were launched from time to time supported by foreign aids but malaria situation
      has remained static and worsened in years of good rainfall. At times malaria
      relented temporarily but returned with vengeance at the local, regional and
      national level, becoming more resilient by acquiring resistance in the vectors
      and the parasites. National developments to improve the economy, without health
      impact assessment, have had adverse consequences by providing enormous breeding
      grounds for the vectors that have become refractory to interventions. As a
      result, malaria prospers and its control is in dilemma, as finding additional
      resources is becoming difficult with the ongoing financial crisis. Endemic
      countries must contribute to make up the needed resources, if malaria is to be
      contained. Malaria control requires long term planning, one that will reduce
      receptivity and vulnerability, and uninterrupted financial support for sustained 
      interventions. While this seems to be a far cry, the environment is becoming more
      receptive for vectors, and epidemics visit the country diverting major resources 
      in their containment, e.g. malaria, dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fevers, and
      Chikungunya virus infection. In the last six decades malaria has taken deep roots
      and diversified into various ecotypes, the control of these ecotypes requires
      local knowledge about the vectors and the parasites. In this review we outline
      the historical account of malaria and methods of control that have lifted the
      national economy in many countries. While battles against malaria should continue
      at the local level, there is a need for large scale environmental improvement.
      Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has provided huge funds for
      malaria control worldwide touching US$ 2 billion in 2011. Unfortunately it is
      likely to decline to US$ 1.5 billion in the coming years against the annual
      requirement of US$ 5 billion. While appreciating the foreign assistance, we wish 
      to highlight the fact that unless we have internal strength of resources and
      manpower, sustained battles against malaria may face serious problems in
      achieving the final goal of malaria elimination.

AB  - The toxicity of mosquito larvicidal activity of leaf essential oil and their
      major chemical constituents from Ocimum basilicum were evaluated against Culex
      tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles subpictus. The chemical
      composition of the leaf essential oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass 
      spectroscopy. GC-MS revealed that the essential oil of O. basilicum contained 20 
      compounds. The major chemical components identified were linalool (52.42%),
      methyl eugenol (18.74%) and 1, 8-cineol (5.61%). The essential oil had a
      significant toxic effect against late third-stage larvae of Cx.
      tritaeniorhynchus, Ae. albopictus and An. subpictus with an LC(50) values of
      14.01, 11.97 and 9.75 ppm and an LC(90) values of 23.44, 21.17 and 18.56 ppm,
      respectively. The results could be useful in search for newer, safer, and more
      effective natural larvicidal agents against Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Ae. albopictus
      and An. subpictus.

TI  - Blood Meal Preference of Some Anopheline Mosquitoes in Command and Non-command
      Areas of Rajasthan, India.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to compare the entomological
      situation by analyzing the blood meal of mosquitoes of canal irrigated and
      non-irrigated areas of Bikaner in order to explore scientific information on the 
      vector biology and malaria burden profile and to plan proper strategies for
      malaria control and eradication. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were collected and the
      abdomen of the blood fed females were crushed on a filter paper for blood meal
      analysis and subjected to precipitin test. RESULTS: The blood meal analysis
      showed that Anopheles subpictus had a preference towards cattle blood, An.
      culicifacies and An. stephensi preferred human blood, while, An. annularis was
      noted to feed only on bovine blood. CONCLUSION: Although An. annularis, has been 
      recently reported from the area, was found to feed exclusively on bovine blood,
      earlier reports suggest that this species is a vector of malaria and therefore
      preventive measures should be taken well in advance before this species gets
      established in the area.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the larvicidal and pupicidal activity of Euphorbia hirta
      (E. hirta) leaf extract and Bacillus sphaericus (B. sphaericus) against the
      malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi). METHODS: The larvicidal and
      pupicidal activity was assayed against An. stephensi at various concentrations
      ranging from (75-375 ppm) under the laboratory as well as field conditions. The
      LC(50) and LC(90) value of the E. hirta leaf extract was determined by probit
      analysis. RESULTS: The plant extract showed larvicidal effects after 24 h of
      exposure; however, the highest larval mortality was found in the methanol extract
      of E. hirta against the first to fourth instars larvae and pupae of values
      LC(50)= 137.40, 172.65, 217.81, 269.37 and 332.39 ppm; B. sphaericus against the 
      first to fourth instars larvae and pupae of values LC(50)= 44.29, 55.83, 68.51,
      82.19 and 95.55 ppm, respectively. Moreover, combined treatment of values of
      LC(50)= 79.13, 80.42, 86.01, 93.00 and 98.12 ppm, respectively. No mortality was 
      observed in the control. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest methanol leaf
      extracts of E. hirta and B. sphaericus have potential to be used as an ideal
      eco-friendly approach for the control of the malarial vector, An. stephensi as
      target species of vector control programs. This study provides the first report
      on the combined mosquito larvicidal and pupicidal activity of this plant crude
      extract and bacterial toxin against An. stephensi mosquitoes.

AB  - Highly stable nanoparticles of metallic silver with average dimension of 26.6 nm 
      were synthesized by a simple, cost-effective, reproducible and previously
      unexploited biogenic source viz. dried green fruits of Drypetes roxburghii
      (Wall.) (common name putranjiva). The as-synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NP)
      were characterized by their characteristic surface plasmon resonance absorption
      spectra, X-ray diffraction analysis, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and
      selected area electron diffraction study. The morphology of the particles was
      determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Fourier transform
      infrared analysis focuses some light on the chemical framework that stabilizes
      the nanoparticles. The analyses of the phytochemicals present in the fruit
      extract of the plant were also performed following standard protocol. Mosquito
      larvicidal bioassay with the Ag NPs was carried out with two mosquitoes, namely
      Anopheles stephensi Liston and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The results show
      impressive mortality rate even at too low concentration of nanoparticle. Toxicity
      test on non-target organism shows no harmful effect during the study period.

TI  - Effect of irrigation systems on temporal distribution of malaria vectors in
      semi-arid regions.
PG  - 349-59
LID - 10.1007/s00484-012-0630-y [doi]
AB  - Previous research models have used climate data to explain habitat conditions of 
      Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting malaria parasites. Although they can estimate
      mosquito populations with sufficient accuracy in many areas, observational data
      show that there is a tendency to underestimate the active growth and reproduction
      period of mosquitoes in semi-arid agricultural regions. In this study, a new,
      modified model that includes irrigation as a factor was developed to predict the 
      active growing period of mosquitoes more precisely than the base model for
      ecophysiological and climatological distribution of mosquito generations
      (ECD-mg). Five sites with complete sets of observational data were selected in
      semi-arid regions of India for the comparison. The active growing period of
      mosquitoes determined from the modified ECD-mg model that incorporated the
      irrigation factor was in agreement with the observational data, whereas the
      active growing period was underestimated by the previous ECD-mg model that did
      not incorporate irrigation. This suggests that anthropogenic changes in the water
      supply due to extensive irrigation can encourage the growth of Anopheles
      mosquitoes through the alteration of the natural water balance in their habitat. 
      In addition, it was found that the irrigation systems not only enable the active 
      growth of mosquitoes in dry seasons but also play an important role in
      stabilizing the growth in rainy seasons. Consequently, the irrigation systems
      could lengthen the annual growing period of Anopheles mosquitoes and increase the
      maximum generation number of mosquitoes in semi-arid subtropical regions.

AB  - Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In the present study, the activity of silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Murraya koenigii plant leaf extract
      against first to fourth instars larvae and pupae of Anopheles stephensi and Aedes
      aegypti was determined. Range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (5, 10, 20, 
      30, and 40 ppm) and ethanol leaf extract (50, 200, 350, 500, and 650 ppm) were
      tested against the larvae of A. stephensi and A. aegypti. The synthesized AgNPs
      from M. koenigii leaf were highly toxic than crude leaf ethanol extract in both
      mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier
      transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Larvae were exposed to varying
      concentrations of aqueous extract of synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. The maximum
      mortality was observed in synthesized AgNPs, and ethanol leaf extract of M.
      koenigii against A. stephensi had LC50 values of 10.82, 14.67, 19.13, 24.35, and 
      32.09 ppm and 279.33, 334.61, 406.95, 536.11, and 700.16 ppm and LC90 values of
      32.38, 42.52, 53.65, 63.51, and 75.26 ppm and 737.37, 843.84, 907.67, 1,187.62,
      and 1,421.13 ppm. A. aegypti had LC50 values of 13.34, 17.19, 22.03, 27.57, and
      34.84 ppm and 314.29, 374.95, 461.01, 606.50, and 774.01 ppm and LC90 values of
      36.98, 47.67, 55.95, 67.36, and 77.72 ppm and 777.32, 891.16, 1,021.90, 1,273.06,
      and 1,509.18 ppm, respectively. These results suggest that the use of M. koenigii
      synthesized silver nanoparticles can be a rapid, environmentally safer
      biopesticide which can form a novel approach to develop effective biocides for
      controlling the target vector mosquitoes.

AB  - Mosquitoes are insect vectors responsible for the transmission of parasitic and
      viral infections to millions of people worldwide, with substantial morbidity and 
      mortality. Infections transmitted by mosquitoes include malaria, yellow fever,
      chikungunya, filariasis and other arboviruses. Insecticides of botanical origin
      may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The
      adulticidal activities of crude hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone and
      methanol leaf extracts of Acalypha alnifolia were assayed for their toxicity
      against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
      stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h
      of exposure. All extracts showed moderate adulticide effects; however, the
      highest adult mortality was found in methanol extract were observed. The LC(50)
      values of A. alnifolia leaf extracts against adulticidal activity of (hexane,
      benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol) A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C.
      quinquefasciatus were the following: A. aegypti values were 371.87, 342.97,
      320.17, 300.86 and 279.75 ppm; A. stephensi values were 358.35, 336.64, 306.10,
      293.01 and 274.76 ppm; C. quinquefasciatus values were 383.59, 354.13, 327.74,
      314.33 and 291.71 ppm. The results of the repellent activity of hexane, benzene, 
      ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extract of A. alnifolia plant at three
      different concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of
      forearm in man and exposed against adult female mosquitoes. In this observation, 
      this plant crude extracts gave protection against mosquito bites without any
      allergic reaction to the test person, and also, the repellent activity is
      dependent on the strength of the plant extracts. Mean percent hatchability of the
      ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post-treatment. The percent hatchability was 
      inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional 
      to the eggs. Mortality of 100 % with methanol extract of A. alnifolia was exerted
      at 125 and 300 ppm. The larval density was decreased after the treatment of plant
      extracts at the breeding sites (water bodies system) of vector mosquitoes, and
      hence, these plant extracts are suitable alternatives of synthetic insecticides
      for mosquito vector management.These results suggest that the leaf solvent plant 
      extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of mosquitoes. This study provides first report on the mosquito ovicidal,
      repellent and adulticidal activities of these plant extracts against mosquito
      vector species from India.

AB  - This study was carried out to determine the human host preference and presence of
      Plasmodium parasite in field collected Anopheles mosquitoes among four villages
      around a military cantonment located in malaria endemic Sonitpur district of
      Assam, India. Encountered malaria vector mosquitoes were identified and tested
      for host preference and Plasmodium presence using PCR method. Human host
      preference was detected using simple PCR, whereas vectorial status for Plasmodium
      parasite was confirmed using first round PCR with genus specific primers and
      thereafter nested PCR with three Plasmodium species specific primers. Out of 1874
      blood fed vector mosquitoes collected, 187 (10%) were processed for PCR, which
      revealed that 40.6% had fed on human blood; 9.2% of human blood fed mosquito were
      harbouring Plasmodium parasites, 71.4% of which were confirmed to Plasmodium
      falciparum. In addition to An. minimus, An. annularis and An. culicifacies were
      also found positive for malaria parasites. The present study exhibits the human
      feeding tendency of Anopheles vectors highlighting their malaria parasite
      transmission potential. The present study may serve as a model for understanding 
      the human host preference of malaria vectors and detection of malaria parasite
      inside the anopheline vector mosquitoes in order to update their vectorial status
      for estimating the possible role of these mosquitoes in malaria transmission. The
      study has used PCR method and suggests that PCR-based method should be used in
      this entire malarious region to correctly report the vectorial position of
      different malaria vectors.

AB  - The primary focus of malaria research and control has been on Plasmodium
      falciparum, the most severe of the four Plasmodium species causing human disease.
      However, the presence of both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax occurs in
      several countries, including India. We developed a mathematical model describing 
      the dynamics of P. vivax and P. falciparum in the human and mosquito populations 
      and fit this model to Indian clinical case data to understand how enhanced
      control measures affect the competition between the two Plasmodium species.
      Around 1997, funding for malaria control in India increased dramatically. Our
      model predicts that if India had not improved its control strategy, the two
      species of Plasmodium would continue to coexist. To determine which control
      measures contributed the most to the decline in the number of cases after 1997,
      we compared the fit of seven models to the 1997-2010 clinical case data. From
      this, we determined that increased use of bednets contributed the most to case
      reduction. During the enhanced control period, the best model predicts that P.
      vivax is out-competing P. falciparum. However, the reproduction numbers are
      extremely close to the invasion boundaries. Consequently, we cannot be confident 
      that this outcome is the true future of malaria in India. We address this
      uncertainty by performing a parametric bootstrapping procedure for each of the
      seven models. This procedure, applied to the enhanced control period, revealed
      that the best model predicts that P. vivax outcompeting P. falciparum is the most
      likely outcome, whereas the remaining candidate models predict the opposite.
      Moreover, the predictions of the top model are counter to what one expects based 
      on the case data alone. Although the proportion of cases due to falciparum has
      been increasing, the best fitting model reveals that this observation is
      insufficient to draw conclusions about the longterm competitive outcome of the
      two species.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph9124704 [doi]
AB  - The magnitude of regional malaria risk is dependent primarily on the dynamics and
      distribution of the vector species, which are determined mainly by climate
      conditions. A coupled model with ecophysiological and climatological factors was 
      developed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of the five species of
      dominant malaria vectors in monsoon Asia. Here, we examined how the potential
      distribution obtained from the model could explain trends in malaria incidence
      observed in India, which has the highest number of confirmed cases of malaria in 
      Asia. Most notably, there was a significant positive correlation between annual
      malaria incidences and the maximum generation number of vectors for each state (p
      < 0.001). Malaria incidence tended to increase exponentially as vector generation
      number increased. In addition, the interannual variation in observed regional
      malaria incidences was synchronized with that of the potential number of vector
      generations. The observed seasonal peak of malaria incidences corresponded
      closely to the simulated appearance period of vector species, except for
      intensively irrigated areas that experience anthropogenic impacts on hydrologic
      conditions. Simulated vector distributions effectively expressed spatial and
      temporal prevalence of malaria in India. This novel approach to modeling based on
      vector ecology is an effective method for assessing malaria risk.

AB  - The present study evaluated the Orthosiphon thymiflorus leaf extract and the
      bacterial insecticide spinosad, testing the first to fourth instars larvae and
      pupae of two important vector mosquitoes, viz., Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
      stephensi. The fresh leaves of O. thymiflorus were washed thoroughly in tap water
      and shade-dried at room temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) for 5 to 8 days. The
      air-dried materials were powdered separately using a commercial electrical
      blender. From the plants, 500 g powder was macerated with 1.5 L organic solvents 
      of petroleum ether sequentially for a period of 72 h each and then filtered. The 
      larval and pupal mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure; no mortality was 
      observed in the control group. The first- to fourth-instar larvae and pupae of A.
      stephensi had values of LC(50) = 309.16, 337.58, 390.42, 429.68, and 513.34 ppm, 
      and A. aegypti had values of LC(50) = 334.78, 366.45, 422.97, 467.94, and 54.02
      ppm, respectively. Spinosad against the A. stephensi had values of LC(50) =
      384.19, 433.39, 479.17, 519.79, and 572.63 ppm, and A. aegypti had values of
      LC(50) = 210.68, 241.20, 264.93, 283.27, and 305.85 ppm, respectively. Moreover, 
      in combined treatment, the A. stephensi had values of LC(50) = 202.36, 224.76,
      250.84, 288.05, and 324.05 ppm, and A. aegypti had values of LC(50) = 217.70,
      246.04, 275.36, 315.29, and 353.80 ppm, respectively. Results showed that the
      leaf extract of O. thymiflorus and bacterial insecticide spinosad are promising
      as a good larvicidal and pupicidal against dengue vector, A. aegypti and malarial
      vector, A. stephensi. This is an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of
      target species of vector control programs.

AB  - Green nanoparticle synthesis has been achieved using environmentally acceptable
      plant extract and ecofriendly reducing and capping agents. The present study was 
      carried out to establish the larvicidal activity of synthesized silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) using leaf extract of Nerium oleander (Apocynaceae) against
      the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of malaria vector, Anopheles
      stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae). Nanoparticles are being used in many commercial
      applications. It was found that aqueous silver ions can be reduced by the aqueous
      extract of the plant parts to generate extremely stable silver nanoparticles in
      water. The results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared
      (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive
      X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis. The production of the AgNPs synthesized using 
      leaf extract of N. oleander was evaluated through a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in a
      wavelength range of 200 to 700 nm. This revealed a peak at 440 nm in N. oleander 
      leaf extracts, indicating the production of AgNPs. The FTIR spectra of AgNPs
      exhibited prominent peaks at 509.12 cm(-1) (C-H bend alkenes), 1,077.05 cm(-1)
      (C-O stretch alcohols), 1,600.63 cm(-1) (N-H bend amines), 2,736.49 and 2,479.04 
      cm(-1) (O-H stretch carboxylic acids), and 3,415.31 cm(-1) (N-H stretching due to
      amines group). An SEM micrograph showed 20-35-nm-size aggregates of spherical-
      and cubic-shaped nanoparticles. EDX showed the complete chemical composition of
      the synthesized nanoparticles of silver. Larvicidal activity of aqueous leaf
      extract of N. oleander and synthesized AgNPs was carried out against Anopheles
      stephensi, and the results showed that the highest larval mortality was found in 
      the synthesized AgNPs against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of
      Anopheles stephensi with the following values: LC(50) of instar larvae 20.60,
      24.90, 28.22, and 33.99 ppm; LC(90) of instar larvae 41.62, 50.33, 57.78, and
      68.41 ppm; and LC(50) and LC(90) of pupae 39.55 and 79.10 ppm, respectively. The 
      aqueous leaf extract exhibited larval toxicity against the first to fourth instar
      larvae and pupae of Anopheles stephensi with the following values: LC(50) of
      instar larvae 232.90, 273.71, 318.94, and 369.96 ppm; LC(90) of instar larvae
      455.95, 563.10, 639.86, and 730.30 ppm; and LC(50) and LC(90) of pupae 426.01 and
      805.13 ppm, respectively. The chi-square value was significant at p < 0.05 level.
      The possible larvicidal activity may be due to penetration of nanoparticles
      through a membrane. The results could suggest that the use of plant N. oleander
      to synthesize silver nanoparticles is a rapid, environmentally safer, and greener
      approach for mosquito control. This could lead us to a new possibility in
      vector-control strategy.

AB  - In Mizoram, the origin and molecular nature of Anopheles species is poorly
      understood, despite the region having high malarial incidence and rich
      biodiversity. A diagnostic PCR assay for distinguishing the Cellia subgenera
      members of Anopheles species was developed based on the interspecific ITS2
      variation. No intraspecific variation was found and the size (362-604bp) and GC
      content (48.8-58.9%) of the ITS2 were highly variable among Anophelines. The ITS2
      of A. vagus is significantly longer than those of other Anopheles species.
      Significant relationship was observed among repeats, minimum free energy and RNA 
      secondary structures. Different types of microsatellites were identified and
      among them dinucleotide, pentanucleotide and polynucleotide microsatellites were 
      predominant. Variation in the length of the ITS2 between species was due to
      indels in simple repeats. Four domain types of RNA secondary structures were
      identified and the lowest free energy values were predicted using the computer
      software, RNAfold. Types I and II were observed only in Neocellia and Myzomyia
      series and Types III and IV were common in Neocellia and Pyretophorus series.
      ITS2-based PCR protocol provides a means for vector ecologists, malaria
      epidemiologists and control personnel to accurately identify members of the
      subgenera Cellia and a better understanding of their genomic status in Mizoram.

AB  - The conservation of hox genes as well as their genomic organization across the
      phyla suggests that this system of anterior-posterior axis formation arose early 
      during evolution and has come under strong selection pressure. Studies in the
      split Hox cluster of Drosophila have shown that proper expression of hox genes is
      dependent on chromatin domain boundaries that prevent inappropriate interactions 
      among different types of cis-regulatory elements. To investigate whether boundary
      function and their role in regulation of hox genes is conserved in insects with
      intact Hox clusters, we used an algorithm to locate potential boundary elements
      in the Hox complex of mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Several potential boundary
      elements were identified that could be tested for their functional conservation. 
      Comparative analysis revealed that like Drosophila, the bithorax region in A.
      gambiae contains an extensive array of boundaries and enhancers organized into
      domains. We analysed a subset of candidate boundary elements and show that they
      function as enhancer blockers in Drosophila. The functional conservation of
      boundary elements from mosquito in fly suggests that regulation of hox genes
      involving chromatin domain boundaries is an evolutionary conserved mechanism and 
      points to an important role of such elements in key developmentally regulated
      loci.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases with an economic impact create loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates. 
      Mosquito control is facing a threat because of the emergence of resistance to
      synthetic insecticides. Extracts from plants may be alternative sources of
      mosquito control agents because they constitute a rich source of bioactive
      compounds that are biodegradable into nontoxic products and potentially suitable 
      for use to control mosquitoes. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
      suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. In view of the recently
      increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to
      chemical insecticide, this study was undertaken to assess the adulticidal,
      repellent, and ovicidal potential of the crude hexane, ethyl acetate, benzene,
      aqueous, and methanol solvent extracts from the medicinal plants Andrographis
      paniculata, Cassia occidentalis, and Euphorbia hirta against the medically
      important mosquito vector, Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae).The adult
      mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate
      adulticide effects; however, the highest adult mortality was found in methanol
      extract of A. paniculata followed by C. occidentalis and E. hirta against the
      adults of A. stephensi with LC(50) and LC(90) values of 210.30, 225.91, and
      263.91 ppm and 527.31, 586.36, and 621.91 ppm, respectively. The results of the
      repellent activity of hexane, ethyl acetate, benzene, aqueous, and methanol
      extract of A. paniculata, C. occidentalis, and E. hirta plants at three different
      concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of forearm in
      man and exposed against adult female mosquitoes. In this observation, these three
      plant crude extracts gave protection against mosquito bites without any allergic 
      reaction to the test person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent on the
      strength of the plant extracts. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal
      activity was observed 48 h post-treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely
      proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional to the
      eggs. Mortality of 100 % with methanol extract of A. paniculata exerted at 150
      ppm and aqueous, methanol extract of C. occidentalis and E. hirta were exerted at
      300 ppm. These results suggest that the leaf extracts of A. paniculata, C.
      occidentalis, and E. hirta have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly
      approach for the control of the A. stephensi. Further detailed research is needed
      to identify the active ingredient in the extracts and implement the effective
      mosquito management program.

AB  - Ticks and mosquitoes are ectoparasitic arthropods that can transmit a variety of 
      diseases to humans and animals during blood feeding and causing serious
      infectious disorders. The purpose of the present study was to assess the
      acaricidal and insecticidal property of ethyl acetate extract and its compounds
      isolated from marine actinobacteria, Streptomyces VITSTK7 sp. against the larvae 
      of cattle ticks, Haemaphysalis bispinosa and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus 
      (Acari: Ixodidae); fourth-instar larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus;
      and filarial vector, Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). The ethyl
      acetate extract was loaded on silica gel column and separated with chloroform,
      methanol, and acetone as the solvents system. The separation of fractions was
      visualized by the thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate, further confirmed by
      high-performance liquid chromatography, and followed by gas liquid
      chromatography. Three major fractions were analyzed in mass spectroscopy (MS) and
      matched with existing compounds in the data base. Based on the fragment pattern, 
      it led to the major compounds which were predicted as cyclopentanepropanoic acid,
      3,5-bis(acetyloxy)-2-[3-(methoxyimino)octyl], methyl ester (13.3 %) 1;
      5-azidomethyl-3-(2-ethoxy
      carbonyl-ethyl)-4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, ethyl ester 
      (18.2 %) 2; and akuammilan-16-carboxylic acid, 17-(acetyloxy)-10-methoxy, methyl 
      ester (16R) (53.3 %) 3. The maximum efficacy was observed in compounds 1, 2, and 
      3, and the ethyl acetate extract of Streptomyces VITSTK7 sp. against the larvae
      of H. bispinosa (LC(50) = 1,573.36, 1,333.09, 1,073.29, and 409.71 ppm; r(2) =
      0.0.990, 0.934, 0.935, and 0.908), R. microplus (LC(50) = 1,877.86, 815.83,
      1,631.14, and 441.54 ppm; r(2) = 0.981, 0.926, 0.0970, and 0.915), A. subpictus
      (LC(50) = 273.89, 687.69, 464.75, and 223.83 ppm; r(2) = 0.758, 0.924, 0.841, and
      0.902), and C. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 430.06, 881.59, 777.0, and 195.70 ppm; 
      r(2) = 0.839, 0.859, 0.870, and 0.882), respectively. Results of the present
      study provide evidence that the maximum parasitic activity of ethyl acetate
      extract and a synergistic effect of combinations of different compounds have been
      suggested. The control (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the concurrent
      assay. In the present study, a novel, targeted, simple, and eco-friendly approach
      has been suggested to control blood-feeding parasites.

      larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. GC and
      GC-MS analyses revealed that the essential oil contain 51 compounds. Estragole
      (34.69 %) and beta-pinene(23.59 %) were identified as the major constituents
      followed by methyl (Z)-caryophyllene (11.05 %), eugenol (6.50 %), linalool (3.97 
      %), phytol (3.27 %), sabinene (2.41 %) and limonene (2.27 %). Larval mortality
      was observed after 12 and 24 h of exposure period. The oil showed remarkable
      larvicidal activity against A. stephensi (LC(50) = 38.93 and LC(90) = 108.64 ppm 
      (after 12 h); LC(50) = 15.03 and LC(90) = 36.69 ppm (after 24 h)), A. aegypti
      (LC(50) = 37.60 and LC(90) = 104.69 ppm (after 12 h); LC(50) = 11.59 and LC(90) =
      42.95 ppm (after 24 h)) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 52.08 and LC(90) =
      124.33 ppm (after 12 h); LC(50) = 22.49 and LC(90) = 60.90 ppm (after 24 h)).
      Based on the results, the essential oil of F. limonia can be considered as a new 
      source of larvicide for the control of vector mosquitoes.

AB  - Anopheles fluviatilis James, an important malaria vector in the Oriental region
      has been established as a complex of at least three cryptic species which vary in
      their biological characteristics and malaria transmission potential. The sibling 
      species S, T and U of Fluviatilis Complex can be identified by examination of
      species-specific fixed inversions in the polytene chromosomes and can also be
      differentiated by an allele-specific PCR assay based on differences in the D3
      region of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of these species. Here we report a new An.
      fluviatilis population from villages under Laksar Community Health Centre,
      District Haridwar (Uttarakhand state), India which differs from the three sibling
      species of Fluviatilis Complex by two fixed paracentric inversions, s(1) and S in
      polytene chromosome arms 2 and 3 respectively. Longitudinal study carried out in 
      study villages showed that the new cytotype was sympatric with species T and U in
      all the collections and no inversion heterozygotes were observed between them.
      Thus presence of two fixed paracentric inversions in polytene chromosomes with
      total absence of inversion heterozygotes demonstrates reproductive isolation
      which unequivocally establishes this cytological variant as a new species,
      provisionally designated as species V in the Fluviatilis Complex. Analysis of DNA
      sequences of D3 domain of 28S rDNA and ITS 2 region has also shown that species V
      is distinctly different from species S, T and U. With the discovery of new
      species in the Fluviatilis Complex, in-depth studies are required to know its
      distribution pattern and biological characteristics and to ascertain its role in 
      malaria transmission.

TI  - Field evaluation of Icon(R)Life, a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) against
      Anopheles culicifacies and transmission of malaria in District Gautam Budh Nagar 
      (Uttar Pradesh), India.
PG  - 181-7
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In the present study, Icon(R)Life net, a long-lasting
      polyethylene net, 100 denier and bursting strength of minimum 280 kpa
      incorporated with deltamethrin @ 65 mg/m2 was evaluated for its efficacy in
      reducing the density of malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies and impact on
      malaria prevalence in a malaria endemic area of District Gautam Budh Nagar,
      India. METHODS: Wash resistance of Icon(R)Life LLIN was determined up to 20
      serial washings using An. culicifacies in cone bioassays under field conditions. 
      Efficacy of Icon(R)Life LLIN was determined in the field in three sets of
      villages in District Gautam Budh Nagar (Uttar Pradesh), India, selected randomly 
      for the intervention with Icon(R)Life LLIN, untreated nets and a control without 
      any intervention for the period of August 2008-July 2009. Entomological and
      malariometric indices in all the three villages were compared during pre- and
      post-intervention periods for one year against An. culicifacies. A survey was
      also conducted in the village provided with Icon(R)Life LLIN to assessing the
      perception of community regarding acceptance of these nets by the community.
      RESULTS: In cone bioassays on Icon(R)Life LLIN with An. culicifacies, >95%
      knockdown within 1 h and 100% mortality after 24 h exposure were reported even
      after 20x serial washings under field conditions. Results of the field study
      revealed reduced entry rate, resting density and parity rate of An. culicifacies 
      in the village with Icon(R)Life LLIN when compared to no net and untreated net
      villages. Number of malaria cases reported were less in the Icon(R)Life LLIN used
      villages when compared to other two villages. The community compliance and
      acceptance was high and no adverse health events were reported by the households 
      using these nets. CONCLUSIONS: Icon(R)Life LLIN is an effective intervention for 
      the control of An. culicifacies transmitted malaria in India. Long-term studies
      are indicated for the duration of effectiveness and to ascertain the
      epidemiological impact of the use of Icon(R)Life nets.

TI  - Resting behaviour of Anopheles stephensi type form to assess its amenability to
      control malaria through indoor residual spray.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In the present study, an attempt was made to find
      reasons of ineffectiveness of indoor residual spray to interrupt malaria
      transmission by investigating the behaviour of two variants of Anopheles
      stepnesi, viz. type form and mysorensis in rural areas of Rajasthan, India.
      METHODS: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high malarious (DDT
      spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for the study in Arid zone 
      district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April 2006. Resting behaviour of the
      species during all its movement rhythms covering 24 h period related to: (i)
      swarming/ mating; (ii) pre- and post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting
      between hoping movements; (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity 
      movements in response to temperature changes, were carried out. RESULTS: The
      results showed that household objects like cupboards, furnitures, hanging
      clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes, cobwebs and floor were the
      dominant resting sites both in sprayed and unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97%
      of An. stephensi preferred to rest on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed 
      villages respectively. There was no significant difference in resting behaviour
      of the species in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time 
      was recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15 to 25 
      min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard--open to sky) species starts entering the
      rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that during III quarter (0100 to 0400
      hrs) maximum species entered into the room were 56% in unsprayed and 62% in
      sprayed villages. Statistically there was no significant difference in the entry 
      of mosquitoes (p >0.05) in both the groups of villages. CONCLUSION: Before DDT
      era, An. stephensi was found resting at all heights of the walls inside the human
      dwellings. Present study revealed that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable
      surfaces and tend to rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms
      starting from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the
      courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day time
      resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An. stephensi on
      unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for failure of malaria
      control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an integrated vector control
      strategy based upon interesectoral, environmental, larviciding with
      chemical/biolarvicide and use of larvivorous fish wherever feasible. Such a
      control strategy offers cost-effective and sustainable option than indoor
      residual spray.

TI  - Studies on the impact of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in relation

      Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 487-99

AB  - Biosynthesized nanoparticles have been achieved using environmentally acceptable 
      plant extract and eco-friendly reducing and capping agents. The present study was
      based on assessments of the larvicidal activities to determine the efficacies of 
      synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Vinca
      rosea (L.) (Apocynaceae) against the larvae of malaria vector Anopheles stephensi
      Liston and filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae).
      Larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extract of V. rosea and 
      synthesized AgNPs for 24, 48, and 72 h. AgNPs were rapidly synthesized using the 
      leaf extract of V. rosea, and the formation of nanoparticles was observed within 
      15 min. The results recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared
      (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) support the biosynthesis and
      characterization of AgNPs. The formation of the AgNPs synthesized from the XRD
      spectrum compared with the Bragg reflections at 2theta = 29.36, 38.26, 44.51,
      63.54, and 77.13 degrees which can be indexed to the (121), (111), (200), (220), 
      and (311) orientations, respectively, confirmed the presence of AgNPs. The FTIR
      spectra of AgNPs exhibited prominent peaks at the spectra showed sharp and strong
      absorption band at 3,406.71 to 3,431.90 cm(-1) double in case of NH(2) group of a
      primary amine (N-H stretch). The presence of the sharp peak at 2,926.54 to
      2,925.80 cm(-1) very broad often looks like distorted baseline (O-H carboxylic
      acids). The band 1,633.26 to 1,625.81 cm(-1) was assigned to C = C alkenes,
      aromatic ring stretching vibration, respectively. SEM analysis of the synthesized
      AgNPs clearly showed the clustered and irregular shapes, mostly aggregated and
      having the size of 120 nm. TEM reveals spherical shape of synthesized AgNPs.
      Particle size analysis revealed that the size of particles ranges from 25 to 47
      nm with average size of 34.61 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the
      complete chemical composition of the synthesized AgNPs. In larvicidal activity,
      the results showed that the maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized AgNPs
      against the fourth instar larvae of A. stephensi (LC(50) = 12.47 and 16.84 mg/mL 
      and LC(90) = 36.33 and 68.62 mg/mL) on 48 and 72 h of exposure and against C.
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 43.80 mg/mL and LC(90) = 120.54 mg/mL) on 72-h
      exposure, and aqueous extract showed 100 % mortality against A. stephensi and C. 
      quinquefasciatus (LC(50) = 78.62 and 55.21 mg/mL and LC(90) = 184.85 and 112.72
      mg/mL) on 72-h exposure at concentrations of 50 mg/mL, respectively. The AgNPs
      did not exhibit any noticeable toxicity on Poecilia reticulata after 24, 48, and 
      72 h of exposure. These results suggest that the synthesized AgNPs have the
      potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of the A. 
      stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. This method is considered as a new approach to
      control vectors. Therefore, this study provides the first report on the mosquito 
      larvicidal activity of V. rosea synthesized AgNPs against vectors.

AB  - Insect pests inflict damage to humans, farm animals, and crops. Human and animal 
      pests put more than 100 million people and 80 million cattle at risk worldwide.
      Plant pests are the main reason for destroying one fifth of the world's total
      crop production annually. Anopheles stephensi is the major vector of human
      malaria in Middle East and South Asian regions. Spodoptera litura is a
      polyphagous pest of vegetables and field crops. Because of its broad host range, 
      this insect is also known as cluster caterpillar, common cutworm, cotton
      leafworm, tobacco cutworm, tobacco caterpillar, and tropical armyworm. The toxic 
      effects of methanolic extract of Senna alata and microbial insecticide, Bacillus 
      sphericus, were tested against the polyphagous crop pest, S. litura (Fab.), and
      the malarial vector, A. stephensi. Results from the present study states that B. 
      sphericus is more toxic than S. alata to both the crop pest and mosquito. The
      malarial vector, A. stephensi, was found to be susceptible than the crop pest, S.
      litura. Both the botanical and microbial insecticide showed excellent larvicidal,
      pupicidal, longevity, fecundity, and growth regulatory activities. Median lethal 
      concentrations of B. sphericus and methanolic extract of S. alata observed to
      kill the third instar of S. litura were 0.52 and 193.09 ppm and A. stephensi were
      0.40 and 174.64 ppm, respectively.

AB  - The present study was on assessment of the anti-parasitic activities of nickel
      nanoparticles (Ni NPs) against the larvae of cattle ticks Rhipicephalus
      (Boophilus) microplus and Hyalomma anatolicum (a.) anatolicum (Acari: Ixodidae), 
      fourth instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex
      gelidus (Diptera: Culicidae). The metallic Ni NPs were synthesized by polyol
      process from Ni-hydrazine as precursor and Tween 80 as both the medium and the
      stabilizing reagent. The synthesized Ni NPs were characterized by Fourier
      transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis which indicated the presence of
      Ni NPs. Synthesized Ni NPs showed the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at 42.76
      degrees , 53.40 degrees , and 76.44 degrees , identified as 111, 220, and 200
      reflections, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the
      synthesized Ni NPs clearly showed that the Ni NPs were spherical in shape with an
      average size of 150 nm. The Ni NPs showed maximum activity against the larvae of 
      R. (B.) microplus, H. a. anatolicum, A. subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus and C.
      gelidus with LC(50) values of 10.17, 10.81, 4.93, 5.56 and 4.94 mg/L; r(2) values
      of 0.990, 0.993, 0.992, 0.950 and 0.988 and the efficacy of Ni-hydrazine
      complexes showed the LC(50) values of 20.35, 22.72, 8.29, 9.69 and 7.83 mg/L;
      r(2) values of 0.988, 0.986, 0.989, 0.944 and 0.978, respectively. The findings
      revealed that synthesized Ni NPs possess excellent larvicidal parasitic activity.
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on larvicidal activity of 
      blood feeding parasites using synthesized Ni NPs.

TI  - Laboratory observations on the larvicidal efficacy of three plant species against
      mosquito vectors of malaria, dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) and
      lymphatic filariasis in the semi-arid desert.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - Comparative larvicidal efficacy of aqueous and organic solvent extracts from
      seeds, leaves and flowers of three desert plants viz. Calotropis procera (Aiton),
      Tephrosia purpurea (L.) Pers. and Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. was evaluated
      against Anopheles stephensi (Liston), Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Say). For this purpose larvae of all the three mosquito species
      were reared in the laboratory and studies carried out on late 3rd or early 4th
      instars using standard WHO technique. Based on concentration mortality data 24
      and 48 hr LC50and LC90 values along with their 95% fiducial limits, regression
      equation, chi-square (chi2)/ heterogeneity of the response were determined by log
      probit regression analysis. Experiments were carried out with different solvent
      extracts of seeds of C. procera which revealed that methanol (24 hr LC50: 127.2, 
      194.8, 361.0) and acetone (229.9, 368.1,193.0 mg l(-1)) extracts were more
      effective with the three mosquito species, respectively. Petroleum ether extract 
      was effective only on An. stephensi while aqueous extracts were not effective at 
      all with any of the mosquito species (mortality < 10-30%). Tests carried out with
      methanol extracts of fresh leaves (24 hr LC50: 89.2, 171.2, 369.7) and flowers
      (24 hr LC50: 94.7,617.3, 1384.0 mg l-(-1)) of Calotropis showed that preparations
      from fresh parts were 2-3 times more effective as compared to the stored plant
      parts. Efficacy was less than 10-30% with both An. aegypti and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus while An. stephensi was still susceptible to extracts from both 
      leaves and flowers even after two years of storage. The 24 hr LC50 values as
      observed for methanol extracts of seeds of T. purpurea and leaves of P. juliflora
      were 74.9, 63.2 and 47.0 and 96.2,128.1 and 118.8 mg l(-1) for the above three
      mosquito species, respectively. Experiments carried out up to 500 mg l-(1) with
      leaves (T. purpurea) and seeds (P. juliflora) extracts show only up to 10-30%
      mortality indicating that active larvicidal principle may be present only in the 
      seeds of Tephrosia and leaves of Prosopis. In general, anophelines were found
      more susceptible than the culicines to the plant derived derivatives. More
      studies are being carried outon some other desert plants found in this arid
      region. The study would be of great importance while formulating vector control
      strategy based on alternative plant based insecticides in this semi-arid region.

      fringe malaria in district Sonitpur, Assam (India).
PG  - 123-8
AB  - The prevalence and bionomics of known Indian malaria vector anophelines was
      studied in three forest fringe villages in Sonitpur district of Assam, India.
      Anopheles philippinensis/nivipes (36.8%) and An. annularis (25.6%) were the most 
      abundant of the seven vector anopheline species recorded. Densities of vector
      anophelines in general were high during monsoon season and low during winter
      months. An. dirus s.l. was the most anthropophagic (91.6%) of all the species
      collected whereas, An. annularis, An. fluviatilis s.l. and An. varuna were
      predominantly zoophagic. The highest and the lowest slide positivity rates (SPR) 
      was recorded during monsoon (36%) and winter (12.5%) seasons, respectively. SPR
      was positively correlated with vector anopheline densities (r = 0.902), which
      itself was found to be correlated with mean minimum temperature and relative
      humidity (RH).

TI  - Centenary celebrations article: Plasmodium knowlesi: from macaque monkeys to
      humans in South-east Asia and the risk of its spread in India.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - The identification of a large focus of Plasmodium knowlesi in Malaysian Borneo
      and subsequent reports from several countries in South-east Asia has led its
      recognition as the fifth human malaria parasite. The natural preferred hosts of
      this species still continue to be macaque monkeys that live in broad-leaf rain
      forests. This review describes the distribution of macaque monkeys, the Anopheles
      species belonging to the Leucosphyrus Group that have been incriminated as
      vectors, morphological and clinical features of this parasite, and the
      transmission cycles that have been identified for this parasite. As the
      North-eastern states of India share their borders with P. knowlesi malaria
      endemic countries and because travelers from countries in South-east Asia visit
      India and vice versa, risks of this parasite entering India and its spread are
      also discussed.

TI  - Prevalence and incrimination of Anopheles fluviatilis species S (Diptera:
      Culicidae) in a malaria endemic forest area of Chhattisgarh state, central India.
PG  - 215
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chhattisgarh state in central India is highly endemic for malaria and
      contributes about 13% of annually reported malaria cases in the country with
      predominance of P. falciparum. Entomological investigations were carried out in a
      tribal forested area of district Bastar located in the southern part of
      Chhattisgarh state to record the prevalence of sibling species of Anopheles
      fluviatilis and An. culicifacies complexes. The vector species complexes were
      investigated at sibling species level for their biology in terms of resting and
      feeding behavior and malaria transmission potential. METHODS: Indoor resting
      vector mosquitoes collected during 2010-2011 were identified to sibling species
      by cytotaxonomy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The blood meal source 
      analysis and incrimination studies were done at sibling species level by counter 
      current immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      respectively. RESULTS: Analysis of sibling species composition revealed
      predominance of An. fluviatilis species S in the study area, which was found to
      be highly anthropophagic and rested in human dwellings whereas the sympatric
      species T was primarily zoophagic. Incrimination studies showed high sporozoite
      rate in species S, thereby confirming its vectorial efficiency. An. culicifacies 
      was encountered in low numbers and comprised species B and C in almost equal
      proportion. Both these species were found to be exclusively zoophagic.
      CONCLUSION: The observations made strongly suggest that species S of Fluviatilis 
      Complex is the principal vector of malaria in certain forest areas of district
      Bastar, Chhattisgarh state and should be the target species for vector control
      operation. Vector control strategies based on biological characteristics of
      Fluviatilis S will lead to substantial decline in malaria incidence in such
      areas.

TI  - Adulticidal properties of Cardiospermum halicacabum plant extracts against three 
      important vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 95-104
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine adulticidal activitiy of hexane, ethyl acetate, benzene, 
      chloroform and methanol leaf extracts of Cardiospermum halicacabum against Culex 
      quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus), Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and
      Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bioassay was
      conducted in an experimental kit consisting of two cylindrical plastic tubes both
      measuring 125 x 44 mm following the WHO method; Mortality of the mosquitoes was
      recorded after 24 h. RESULTS: The adulticidal activity of plant extracts showed
      moderate toxic effect on the adult mosquitoes after 24 h of exposure period.
      However, compared to other solvents highest mortality was found in methanol
      extract of C. halicacabum against all the three mosquitoes. Among them An.
      stephensi produce the highest LC50 and LC90 (186.00 and 346.06 ppm) values.
      CONCLUSIONS: From the results it can be concluded the crude extract of C.
      halicacabum was an excellent potential for controlling Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. 
      aegypti and An. stephensi mosquitoes.

TI  - Insecticide susceptibility status in three medically important species of
      mosquitoes, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, from
      Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Karnataka, India.
PG  - 257-67
LID - 10.1002/ps.3383 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of resistance among mosquito vectors of diseases is of
      growing concern in many countries of the subtropics, including much of India. The
      distributions of susceptibility/resistance to insecticides are scarcely recorded 
      and are unknown in many parts of India. This manuscript reports the
      susceptibility status among strains of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and
      Culex quinquefasciatus collected from different geographical areas of Bruhat
      Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Karnataka, to six conventionally used
      insecticides. RESULTS: An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus from
      different geographic areas showed susceptibility towards temephos. However,
      susceptibility was meagre for most of the other insecticides used in the study.
      Strong resistance to propoxur was reported in Ullala (RR(90) = 467.1) and
      Bannerghatta (RR(90) = 12,265) populations of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti
      respectively. RR(90) >/= 12,830 was recorded as higher in the Yelahanka (YLK)
      population of Cx. quinquefasciatus to neem. Significant differences at LC(50) and
      LC(90) concentrations were observed against various insecticides in different
      mosquito populations. Resistance was observed against some of the larvicides for 
      the diagnostic dose recommended by WHO. CONCLUSION: The results form baseline
      data on the susceptibility status of three medically important mosquito vectors
      of diseases to commonly used insecticides in the field at present emphasise the
      importance of carrying out more effective and planned vector control measures.

TI  - Effect of Ageratum houstonianum Mill. (Asteraceae) leaf extracts on the
      oviposition activity of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex

AB  - Plant extracts have been studied extensively for their insecticidal activity
      against immature stages and adult mosquitoes. They have also been reported to
      influence the habitat preference of ovipositing mosquitoes. Ageratum
      houstonianum, a medicinal plant belonging to the family Asteraceae, has been
      reported to possess insecticidal activity, and in the present study, the
      ovipositional attractant/deterrent activity was studied. The effect of Ageratum
      houstonianum crude leaf extracts on the oviposition of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes
      aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus was studied at 0.1 % concentration in
      laboratory. Among hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol crude leaf extracts,
      methanol showed an effective deterrent activity against all the three vector
      species with an oviposition active index of -0.8, -0.8 and -0.9, respectively.
      Field trials carried out to study the effect of 0.1 % methanol extract on
      oviposition of Aedes species indicated effective deterrence ranging from 79.0 to 
      100.0 % in indoor and 74.6 to 100.0 % in outdoor ovitraps. The potential
      oviposition deterrent property of Ageratum houstonianum crude leaf extracts
      observed in both laboratory and field studies indicates the presence of
      phytocompounds that act as effective contact deterrent. Further, isolation,
      identification and preparation of suitable formulation of the effective
      phytocompounds of Ageratum houstonianum that act as a contact deterrent are
      required.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases have an economic impact, including loss in commercial and
      labor outputs, particularly in countries with tropical and subtropical climates; 
      however, no part of the world is free from vector-borne diseases. The aim of the 
      present study, to evaluate the larvicidal, pupicidal, repellent, and adulticidal 
      activities of methanol crude extract of Artemisia nilagirica were assayed for
      their toxicity against two important vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles stephensi
      and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). The fresh leaves of A. nilagirica were
      washed thoroughly in tap water and shade dried at room temperature (28 +/- 2
      degrees C) for 5-8 days. The air-dried materials were powdered separately using
      commercial electrical blender. From the plants, 500 g powdered was macerated with
      1.5 L organic solvents of methanol sequentially for a period of 72 h each and
      filtered. The larval and pupal mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure; no 
      mortality was observed in the control group. The first- to fourth-instar larvae
      and pupae of A. stephensi had values of LC(50) = 272.50, 311.40, 361.51, 442.51, 
      and 477.23 ppm, and the LC(90) = 590.07, 688.81, 789.34, 901.59, and 959.30 ppm; 
      the A. aegypti had values of LC(50) = 300.84, 338.79, 394.69, 470.74, and 542.11 
      ppm, and the LC(90) = 646.67, 726.07, 805.49, 892.01, and 991.29 ppm,
      respectively. The results of the repellent activity of plant extract of A.
      nilagirica plants at five different concentrations of 50, 150, 250, 350, and 450 
      ppm were applied on skin of fore arm in man and exposed against adult female
      mosquitoes. In this observation, the plant crude extract gave protection against 
      mosquito bites without any allergic reaction to the test person, and also, the
      repellent activity is dependent on the strength of the plant extracts. The adult 
      mortality was found in methanol extract of A. nilagirica, with the LC(50) and
      LC(90) values of 205.78 and 459.51 ppm for A. stephensi, and 242.52 and 523.73
      ppm for A. aegypti, respectively. This result suggests that the leaf extract have
      the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of
      vector mosquito as target species.

TI  - Larvicidal and repellent properties of Adansonia digitata against medically
      important human malarial vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi (Diptera:
      Culicidae).
PG  - 86-90
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Development of plant-based alternative compounds for
      mosquito control has gained importance now-a-days, in view of increasing
      resistance in mosquito vectors to existing insecticides. The larvicidal and
      repellent activities of benzene, chloroform, hexane and methanol leaf extracts of
      Indian medicinal plant, Adansonia digitata were investigated against malarial
      vector, Anopheles stephensi. METHODS: In all, 25 III instar larvae of An.
      stephensi were exposed to various concentrations (30-180 mg/l) in the laboratory 
      by using the standard protocol described by WHO (2005). The larvae were exposed
      for 24 h and mortalities were subjected to log-probit analysis. Repellent
      activity of crude leaf extract at the dosages of 2, 4 and 6 mg/cm2 was evaluated 
      in a net cage (45 x 30 x 45 cm) containing 100 blood starved female mosquitoes of
      An. stephensi using the protocol of WHO (1996). RESULTS: Preliminary
      phytochemical analysis of A. digitata showed the presence of triterpenoids and
      saponins. The LC50 and LC90 values of hexane, benzene, chloroform, and methanol
      extracts of A. digitata against An. stephensi larvae in 24 h were 111.32, 97.13, 
      88.55, 78.18 and 178.63, 176.19, 168.14, 155.42 mg/l, respectively. The repellent
      activity of methanol extract was found to be most effective and at higher
      concentration of 6 mg/cm2 benzene, chloroform hexane and methanol extracts
      provided 100% protection up to 150, 180, 120 and 210 min against An. stephensi,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The preliminary study indicated that A. digitata showed
      larvicidal and repellent activities against An. stephensi and could be used for
      controlling mosquitoes. Further studies are indicated to purify the active
      compounds from these plants for developing larvicide and repellents.

      Diptera).
PG  - 598-604

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potentiality of mosquitocidal activity of
      Gliricidia sepium (G. sepium) (Jacq.) (Leguminosae). METHODS: Twenty five early
      third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi) were exposed to
      various concentrations (50-250 ppm) and the 24 h LC(50) values of the G. sepium
      extract was determined by probit analysis. The ovicidal activity was determined
      against An. stephensi to various concentrations ranging from 25-100 ppm under
      laboratory conditions. The eggs hatchability was assessed 48 h post treatment.
      The pupicidal activity was determined against An. stephensi to various
      concentrations ranging from 25-100 ppm. Mortality of each pupa was recorded after
      24 h of exposure to the extract. RESULTS: Results pertaining to the experiment
      clearly revealed that ethanol extract showed significant larvicidal, ovicidal and
      pupicidal activity against the An. stephensi. Larvicidal activity of ethanol
      extracts of G. sepium showed maximum mortality in 250 ppm concentration
      (96.0+/-2.4)%. Furthermore, the LC(50) was found to be 121.79 and the LC(90)
      value was recorded to be 231.98 ppm. Ovicidal activity of ethanol extract was
      assessed by assessing the egg hatchability. Highest concentration of both solvent
      extracts exhibited 100% ovicidal activity. Similarly, pupae exposed to different 
      concentrations of ethanol extract were found dead with 58.10% adult emergence
      when it was treated with 25 ppm concentration. Similarly, 18.36 (n=30; 61.20%);
      21.28(70.93) and 27.33(91.10) pupal mortality was recorded from the experimental 
      pupae treated with 50, 75 and 100 ppm concentration of extracts. Three fractions 
      have been tested for their larvicidal activity of which the Fraction 3 showed the
      LC(50) and LC(90) values of 23.23 and 40.39 ppm. With regard to the ovicidal
      effect fraction 3 showed highest ovicidal activities than the other two
      fractions. Furthermore, there were no hatchability was recorded above 50 ppm
      (100% egg mortality) in the experimental group. Statistically significant
      pupicidal activity was recorded from 75 ppm concentration. CONCLUSIONS: From the 
      results it can be concluded the crude extract of G. sepium is an excellent
      potential for controlling An. stephensi mosquito. It is apparent that, fraction 3
      possess a novel and active principle which could be responsible for those
      biological activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate lethal effect of culture filtrates of Streptomyces
      citreofluorescens (S. citreofluorescens) against Anopheles stephensi (An.
      stephensi), Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus), and Aedes aegypti (Ae.
      aegypti) larvae vectors for malaria, filarial and dengue. METHODS: The culture
      filtrates obtained from S. citreofluorescens 2528 was grown in Potato Dextrose
      Broth (PDB), filtrated and used for the bioassay after a growth of 15 days.
      RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the An. stephensi shows mortalities with
      LC(50), LC(90) values of first instar 46.8 muL/mL, 79.5 muL/mL, second instar
      79.0 muL/mL, 95.6 muL/mL, third instar 79.0 muL/mL, 136.9 muL/mL, and fourth
      instar 122.6 muL/mL, 174.5 muL/mL. Whereas, The Cx. quinquefasciatus were found
      effective on first instar 40.0 muL/mL, 138.03 muL/mL, second instar 80.0 muL/mL, 
      181.97 muL/mL, third instar 100.0 muL/mL, 309.2 muL/mL, and fourth instar 60.0
      muL/mL, 169.82 muL/mL. The Ae. aegypti were successfully achieved susceptible
      with higher concentrations in comparisons of An. stephensi and Cx.
      quinquefasciatus larvae. These outcomes of the investigations have compared with 
      the Chitinase of Streptomyces griseus (S. griseus) C6137 that shows 90%-95%
      mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These new findings significantly permitted that the
      culture filtrates of S. citreofluorescens can be used as bacterial larvicides.
      This is an environmentally safe approach to control the vectors of malaria,
      dengue and filariasis of tropical areas.

      suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The adulticidal and
      repellent activities of crude hexane, chloroform, benzene, acetone, and methanol 
      extracts of the leaf of Cassia tora were assayed for their toxicity against three
      important vector mosquitoes, viz., Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and
      Anopheles stephensi. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All
      extracts showed moderate adulticidal effects; however, the highest adult
      mortality observed was found in methanol extract. The LC(50) and LC(90) values of
      C. tora leaf extracts against adulticidal activity of (hexane, chloroform
      benzene, acetone, and methanol) C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti, and A. stephensi
      were the following: C. quinquefasciatus LC(50) values were 338.81, 315.73,
      296.13, 279.23, and 261.03 ppm and LC(90) values were 575.77, 539.31, 513.99,
      497.06, and 476.03 ppm; A. aegypti LC(50) values were 329.82, 307.31, 287.15,
      269.57, and 252.03 ppm and LC(90) values were 563.24, 528.33, 496.92, 477.61, and
      448.05 ppm; and A. stephensi LC(50) values were 317.28, 300.30, 277.51, 263.35,
      and 251.43 ppm and LC(90) values were 538.22, 512.90, 483.78, 461.08, and 430.70 
      ppm, respectively. The results of the repellent activity of hexane, chloroform,
      benzene, acetone, and methanol extracts of C. tora plant at three different
      concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/cm(2) were applied on skin of forearm in
      man and exposed against adult female mosquitoes. In this observation, this plant 
      crude extracts gave protection against mosquito bites without any allergic
      reaction to the test person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent on the
      strength of the plant extracts. These results suggest that the leaf solvent plant
      extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of mosquitoes. This is the first report on mosquito adulticidal and
      repellent activities of the reported C. tora against mosquito vectors from
      Southern India.

TI  - Larvicidal, pupicidal, repellent and adulticidal activity of Citrus sinensis
      orange peel extract against Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex
      quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae).
PG  - 1757-69
AB  - Mosquitoes are the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria,
      arboviral encephalitis, dengue fever, chikunguniya fever, West Nile virus and
      yellow fever. These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in
      humans and livestock around the world. The present study explored the effects of 
      orange peel ethanol extract of Citrus sinensis on larvicidal, pupicidal,
      repellent and adulticidal activity against Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and
      Culex quinquefasciatus. The orange peel material was shade dried at room
      temperature and powdered coarsely. From orange peel, 300 g powdered was macerated
      with 1 L of ethanol sequentially for a period of 72 h each and filtered. The
      yields of the orange peel ethanol crude extract of C. sinensis 13.86 g,
      respectively. The extracts were concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary
      vacuum evaporator and stored at a temperature of 4 degrees C. The larvicidal,
      pupicidal and adult mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure; no mortality
      was observed in the control group. For C. sinensis, the median lethal
      concentration values (LC(50)) observed for the larvicidal and pupicidal
      activities against mosquito vector species A. stephensi first to fourth larval
      instars and pupae were 182.24, 227.93, 291.69, 398.00 and 490.84 ppm; A. aegypti 
      values were 92.27, 106.60, 204.87, 264.26, 342.45, 436.93 and 497.41 ppm; and C. 
      quinquefasciatus values were 244.70, 324.04, 385.32, 452.78 and 530.97 ppm,
      respectively. The results of maximum repellent activity were observed at 450 ppm 
      in ethanol extracts of C. sinensis and the mean complete protection time ranged
      from 150 to 180 min was tested. The ethanol extract of C. sinensis showed 100%
      repellency in 150 min and showed complete protection in 90 min at 350 ppm against
      A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The adult
      mortality was found in ethanol extract of C. sinensis with the LC(50) and LC(90) 
      values of 272.19 and 457.14 ppm, A. stephensi; 289.62 and 494.88 ppm, A. aegypti;
      and 320.38 and 524.57 ppm, respectively. These results suggest that the orange
      peel extracts of C. sinensis have the potential to be used as an ideal
      eco-friendly approach for the control of the vector control programmes.

AB  - The present article deals with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
      genotoxicity evaluation of neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid and
      thiamethoxam, by using the genome of a mosquito Anopheles stephensi taken as an
      experimental model. After treatment of the second instar larvae with LC(20) of
      the pesticides for 24 h, the induced nucleotide sequence variations in the
      internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of freshly hatched unfed control and treated
      individuals was studied from the sequence alignment data and the mutations in the
      form of insertion, deletion and substitution of bases were recorded. Measurable
      differences, indicative of the genetic damage due to imidacloprid and
      thiamethoxam were observed when ITS2 sequences of control and treated individuals
      were compared. It was found that imidacloprid-treated individual had 8 deletions,
      29 insertions, 18 transitions and 33 transversions, whereas thiamethoxam-treated 
      individual had 10 deletions, 8 insertions, 47 transitions and 68 transversions.

TI  - Use of a simple DNA extraction method for high-throughput detection of filarial
      parasite Wuchereria bancrofti in the vector mosquitoes.
PG  - 2479-81
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-3026-3 [doi]
AB  - Molecular xenomonitoring of filariasis is the detection of filarial DNA in
      mosquitoes by PCR and a useful tool for monitoring transmission. DNA extraction
      coupled with PCR allows rapid detection of the presence or absence of the
      filarial parasite in vector mosquitoes compared to traditional method of manual
      dissection of the mosquito and observation for parasite under a microscope. A
      Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer-based boiling method of DNA extraction developed earlier by
      us was employed and explored for its suitability in the detection of Wuchereria
      bancrofti DNA in pools of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in real-time PCR
      assay. In this preliminary study, 1,000 laboratory-reared C. quinquefasciatus
      were made into 40 pools, each containing 25 mosquitoes spiked with 2mf. DNA from 
      the first 20 pools was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit as
      standard, and the other 20 pools were subjected to TE buffer-based boiling method
      of DNA extraction. When the results (Ct values) obtained for DNA samples
      extracted by TE buffer-based boiling method were compared with that of the DNA
      samples extracted by the standard Qiagen method, they were found to be highly
      concordant without any significant difference (P = 0.9). Besides being cost- and 
      time-effective, this protocol was found useful in extracting filarial DNA from
      two other mosquito genus Aedes and Anopheles, species of which have been reported
      as important vectors of W. bancrofti in other endemic regions of the world. Thus,
      TE buffer-based boiling method of DNA extraction is useful for the
      high-throughput detection of W. bancrofti in vector mosquitoes.

TI  - Anopheles (Cellia) maculatus group: its spatial distribution and molecular
      characterization of member species in north-east India.
PG  - 62-70
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.06.011 [doi]
AB  - Anopheles (Cellia) maculatus is considered a group of at least nine formally
      named species. Faced with the difficulty of correct morphological identification 
      due to overlapping characters, several member species of the An. maculatus group 
      are known to play important role in malaria transmission in the Oriental region. 
      Current assemblage, distribution and vectorial importance of the member species
      within the Maculatus group is far from clear in the north-eastern region of
      India. Our study encompassing 410 individuals, collected from 67 geo-referenced
      spots across the eight north-east Indian states, identified the presence of 6
      member species of the Maculatus group using the molecular tools. Anopheles
      dravidicus and Anopheles rampae were documented for the first time in this part
      of India with latter forming the new country record. While Anopheles
      pseudowillmori (59.5%) and An. maculatus (32%) were widely available species in
      most of the north-eastern states, restricted distribution of Anopheles willmori
      to Nagaland and that of Anopheles sawadwongporni and An. rampae to Mizoram state 
      was noted. None of the species was found positive for human malaria parasite.
      While no intraspecific differences existed in the sequences of second internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of ribosomal DNA (r-DNA) of the member species
      of the Maculatus group within north-east India, few differences were detected in 
      the sequences of An. dravidicus, An. maculatus and An. pseudowillmori from
      north-east India with species from the neighbouring countries.

AB  - Studies were carried out to evaluate the role of a C(21)-fatty acid ester; propyl
      octadecanoate (PO) for olfaction-mediated behavioral responses of urban malaria
      vector, Anopheles stephensi and dengue vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using
      electroantennogram (EAG), flight orientation and oviposition experiments. Dose
      dependent electrophysiological responses were recorded for PO from the antenna of
      both mosquito species in which 10(-5) g elicited significant EAG response. An.
      stephensi exhibited 2.4, 4.2 and 5.5 fold increased EAG response compared to
      control, while Ae. aegypti showed 1.9, 4.6 and 5.8 fold EAG responses
      respectively at 10(-7) g, 10(-6) g and 10(-5) g doses. In the Y-tube
      olfactometer, 77-80% gravid females of An. stephensi, and 64-77% of Ae. aegypti
      were caught in the chambers releasing 10(-6) g and 10(-5) g plume of PO. The
      synthetic fatty acid ester loaded onto an effervescent tablet at 0.1 mg/L, 1 mg/L
      and 10 mg/L elicited increased ovipositional responses from gravid mosquitoes
      compared to control. The oviposition activity indices (OAI) of An. stephensi
      females were +0.40, +0.51 and +0.58, whereas the OAI for Ae. aegypti females were
      +0.05, +0.36 and +0.57 respectively in 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L of PO; indicated
      concentration dependent increased egg deposition. Similarly, in the residual
      activity studies, oviposition substrates treated with PO on effervescent tablet
      at 1mg/L and 10mg/L received significantly increased egg deposition by gravid
      females of both mosquito species for up to 1 week compared to control substrates.
      PO can potentially be used in ovitraps to monitor An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti
      populations in the vector surveillance programs.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) (Family: Rubiaceae) leaf
      extract against Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti.
PG  - 1481-90
AB  - Morinda citrifolia leaf extract was tested for larvicidal activity against three 
      medically important mosquito vectors such as malarial vector Anopheles stephensi,
      dengue vector Aedes aegypti, and filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The
      plant material was shade dried at room temperature and powdered coarsely. From
      the leaf, 1-kg powder was macerated with 3.0 L of hexane, chloroform, acetone,
      methanol, and water sequentially for a period of 72 h each and filtered. The
      yield of extracts was hexane (13.56 g), chloroform (15.21 g), acetone (12.85 g), 
      methanol (14.76 g), and water (12.92 g), respectively. The extracts were
      concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary vacuum evaporator and stored at a
      temperature of 4 degrees C. The M. citrifolia leaf extract at 200, 300, 400, 500,
      and 600 ppm caused a significant mortality of three mosquito species. Hexane,
      chloroform, acetone, and water caused moderate considerable mortality; however,
      the highest larval mortality was methanolic extract, observed in three mosquito
      vectors. The larval mortality was observed after 24-h exposure. No mortality was 
      observed in the control. The third larvae of Anopheles stephensi had values of
      LC(50) = 345.10, 324.26, 299.97, 261.96, and 284.59 ppm and LC(90) = 653.00,
      626.58, 571.89, 505.06, and 549.51 ppm, respectively. The Aedes aegypti had
      values of LC(50) = 361.75, 343.22, 315.40, 277.92, and 306.98 ppm and LC(90) =
      687.39, 659.02, 611.35, 568.18, and 613.25 ppm, respectively. The Culex
      quinquefasciatus had values of LC(50) = 382.96, 369.85, 344.34, 330.42, and
      324.64 ppm and LC(90) = 726.18, 706.57, 669.28, 619.63, and 644.47 ppm,
      respectively. The results of the leaf extract of M. citrifolia are promising as
      good larvicidal activity against the mosquito vector Anopheles stephensi, Aedes
      aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. This is a new eco-friendly approach for the 
      control of vector control programs. Therefore, this study provides first report
      on the larvicidal activities against three species of mosquito vectors of this
      plant extracts from India.

TI  - Malaria outbreak in a non endemic tribal block of Balasore district, Orissa,
      India during summer season.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - A focal outbreak of malaria at Sialimal sub-centre of Balasore district of Orissa
      was reported during the month of March, 2010. Three villages of the above block
      were affected. Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar has conducted an
      entomological survey and a central clinic simultaneously, with door to door
      household survey to identify the fever cases. Within a span of 18 days around 172
      fever cases were reported with Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) of 24.4% and Pf % of
      81%. The malaria epidemiological data of the sub-centre area for last three years
      indicates that the area is non endemic for malaria (API was 0.81). Entomological 
      survey revealed the presence of three known vectors of malaria i.e. Anopheles
      culicifacies, Anopheles annularis and Anopheles subpictus (local vector). Per Man
      Hour Density (PMHD) of these three species were 4.2, 2.8 and 10.8 respectively.
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites were detected in two An. culicifacies, in one
      An. annularis and in one An. subpictus. Larval density of Anopheline mosquitoes
      per dip ranged between 12 to 20. The vectors were found to be resistant to DDT
      but susceptible to synthetic pyrethroid. With this finding necessary remedial
      measures were taken by the government to curtail the transmission.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-189 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study, Interceptor(R), long-lasting polyester net, 75 
      denier and bursting strength of minimum 250 kPa coated with alpha-cypermethrin @ 
      200 mg/m(2) was evaluated for its efficacy in reducing the mosquito density,
      blood feeding inhibition and malaria incidence in a tribal dominated malaria
      endemic area in Chhattisgarh state, central India. Its durability, washing
      practices and usage pattern by the community was also assessed up to a period of 
      three years. METHODS: The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase
      (September 2006 to August 2007), 16 malaria endemic villages in district Kanker
      were randomized into three groups, viz. Interceptor net (LN), untreated polyester
      net (100 denier) and without net. Malaria cases were detected by undertaking
      fortnightly surveillance by home visits and treated as per the national drug
      policy. Mosquito collections were made by hand catch and pyrethrum space spray
      methods from human dwellings once every month. Slide positivity rate (SPR) and
      malaria incidence per 1000 population (PI) were compared between the three study 
      arms to assess the impact of use of Interceptor nets. Simultaneously, wash
      resistance studies were carried out in the laboratory by doing cone bioassays on 
      Interceptor LNs washed up to 20 times. Activities undertaken in second Phase
      (April 2008 to October 2009) after an interval of about 18 months post-net
      distribution included questionnaire based surveys at every six months, i.e. 18,
      24, 30 and 36 months to observe durability, usage pattern of LNs and washing
      practices by the community. After 36 months of field use, 30 nets were retrieved 
      and sampled destructively for chemical analysis. RESULTS: Interceptor nets were
      found effective in reducing the density, parity rate and blood feeding success
      rate of main malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies as compared to that in
      untreated net and no net villages. SPR in LN villages was 3.7% as compared to
      6.5% in untreated and 11% in no net villages. PI in LN villages was 16.4 in
      comparison to 24.8 and 44.2 in untreated polyester net and no net villages
      respectively. In surveys carried out after three years of initial distribution,
      78.7% (737/936) nets were still in possession with the households, of which 68%
      were used every night. An. culicifacies mortality was >80% in cone bioassays done
      on LNs washed up to 20 times in laboratory. Mean alpha-cypermethrin content was
      43.5 +/- 31.7 mg/m(2) on Interceptor LNs withdrawn after three years of household
      use against the baseline specification of 200 mg/m(2). A gradual increase in the 
      proportion of holed nets was observed with the increased period of usage.
      CONCLUSION: Interceptor nets were highly effective in reducing vector densities
      as well as malaria incidence in the study villages. Availability of 78% nets with
      the households in usable condition clearly indicated durability of Interceptor
      LNs up to three years in the rural setting of India. The nets were found to
      contain an effective concentration of alpha-cypermethrin against malaria vector
      after three years of household use.

TI  - Mosquito adulticidal activity of a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus subtilis
      subsp. subtilis.
PG  - 1447-50
LID - 10.1002/ps.3324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A biosurfactant, surfactin, produced by a strain of Bacillus subtilis
      subsp. subtilis (VCRC B471), was effective in killing mosquito larval and pupal
      stages. As it was lethal to the non-feeding pupal stage, it was presumed that it 
      could kill the adult mosquitoes also. In this study, the adulticidal effect of
      the biosurfactant was assessed in the laboratory against a malaria vector,
      Anopheles stephensi. RESULTS: The biosurfactant surfactin, separated from the
      culture supernatant of the production strain, showed mosquito adulticidal
      activity when tested as ultralow-volume (ULV) spray in a Peet-Grady chamber.
      Knockdown activity and mortality were found to increase with increasing surfactin
      dosage. Knockdown dosage (KD) and lethal dosage (LD) were calculated by
      statistical analysis. The KD(50) and KD(90) dosages were 10.73 and 26.39 mg m(-3)
      respectively. The LD(50) and LD(90) dosages were 16.13 and 39.21 mg m(-3) . The
      average droplet size of B. subtilis surfactin was 17.5 +/- 1.07 microm.
      CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the biosurfactant surfactin,
      produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (VCRC B471), is a potential bioadulticide
      for ULV spray against malaria-transmitting Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. This
      is the first report of a mosquito adulticide from a microbial source.

TI  - Mosquito larvicidal and biting deterrency activity of bud of Polianthes tuberosa 
      plants extract against Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Mosquito control by phytochemicals is an alternative method to synthetic
      insecticides, as it is biodegradable and non resistant to vector mosquito.
      Polianthes tuberosa is a perennial plant distributed in many parts of India. The 
      present study was undertaken to scientifically evaluate the larvicide and biting 
      deterrency activity of bud of Polianthes tuberosa against Culex quinquefasciatus 
      and Anopheles stephensi. Crude and solvent extract [ethyl acetate, chloroform:
      methanol (1:1, v/v), acetone] of fresh, mature, bud of P. tuberosa was tested
      against (ex. quinquefasciatus and An. stephensi. The repellent activity tested by
      chloroform: methanol (1:1, v/v) solvent extract against both mosquito species.
      The appropriate lethal concentrations at 24h for chloroform: methanol (1:1, v/v) 
      extract was also studied on non target organisms such as Toxorhynchites larvae,
      Diplonychus annulatum and Chironomus circumdatus. In a 72 hour bioassay
      experiment, 0.5% crude extract showed the highest mortality and chloroform:
      methanol (1:1, v/v) solvent extract showed the highest mortality, the maximum (p 
      < 0.05) mortality was recorded at a concentration of 60 ppm. The chloroform:
      methanol (1:1, v/v) solvent extract provide 4h protection against Cx.
      quinquefasciatus and 5h against An. stephensi from biting. Both crude and
      chloroform: methanol (1:1, v/v) extract showed good result against Cx.
      quinquefasciatus, so it could be used as a mosquito larvicide agent. There is no 
      changes in the activity non-target organism so, it is safe to use.

AB  - Aspergillus niger is a fungus of the genus Aspergillus. It has caused a disease
      called black mold on certain fruits and vegetables. The culture filtrates
      released from the A. niger ATCC 66566 were grown in Czapek dox broth (CDB) then
      filtered with flash chromatograph and were used for the bioassay after a growth
      of thirty days. The result demonstrated these mortalities with LC(50), LC(90),
      and LC(99) values of Culex quinquefasciatus 0.76, 3.06, and 4.75, Anopheles
      stephensi 1.43, 3.2, and 3.86, and Aedes aegypti 1.43, 2.2, and 4.1 mul/cm(2),
      after exposure of seven hours. We have calculated significant LT(90) values of
      Cx. quinquefasciatus 4.5, An. stephensi 3.54, and Ae. aegypti 6.0 hrs,
      respectively. This liquid spray of fungal culture isolate of A. niger can reduce 
      malaria, dengue, and filarial transmission. These results significantly support
      broadening the current vector control paradigm beyond chemical adulticides.

TI  - Immune peptides modelling of Culex pipiens sp by in silico methods.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past 60 years, antibiotics have been critical in the fight
      against infectious diseases caused by bacteria and other microbes. Development of
      resistance to the antibiotics is emerging as a major public health issue which
      has resulted in the search for new antibiotics in order to maintain a pool of
      effective drugs at all times. Currently, there is a great interest in cationic
      peptides as antibiotics. These are reported to destroy the host cell membrane
      rather interacting with the other cell components, which may not face emergence
      of resistance. In mosquitoes, peptides like cecropin, defensin and gambicin
      reported to have inhibitory effect on bacteria, fungi and parasites. These
      peptides are well-characterized at both the biochemical and molecular level from 
      Anopheles and Culex species, yet their 3D structures were not reported. METHODS: 
      Defensin, cecropin and gambicin immune peptides of Culex pipiens was
      characterised to have antiparasitic, antibacterial and antifungal activities.
      Since the crystal structure of defensin, cecropin and gambicin are not yet
      available their 3D structures were determined using homology modeling and Rosetta
      fragment insertion methods and were validated. RESULTS: Stereo chemical
      evaluation indicated that defensin and gambicin showed that 100% residues of
      constructed model lie in the most favoured and allowed regions. Cecropin
      iso-forms A and B showed 100% while C showed 97.6% residues that lie in most
      favoured and allowed regions, which indicated quality models. CONCLUSION:
      Predicted model provide insight into their structure and aid in the development
      of novel antibiotic peptides.

AB  - Presently, there is a need for increased efforts to develop newer and effective
      methods to control mosquito vectors as the existing chemical and biological
      methods are not as effective as in earlier period owing to different technical
      and operational reasons. The use of nanomaterial products in various sectors of
      science including health increased during the last decade. We tested three types 
      of nanosilica, namely lipophilic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic, to assess their
      larvicidal, pupicidal and growth inhibitor properties and also their influence on
      oviposition behaviour (attraction/deterrence) of mosquito species that transmit
      human diseases, namely malaria (Anopheles), yellow fever, chickungunya and dengue
      (Aedes), lymphatic filariasis and encephalitis (Culex and Aedes). Application of 
      hydrophobic nanosilica at 112.5 ppm was found effective against mosquito species 
      tested. The larvicidal effect of hydrophobic nanosilica on mosquito species
      tested was in the order of Anopheles stephensi > Aedes aegypti > Culex
      quinquefasciatus, and the pupicidal effect was in the order of A. stephensi > C. 
      quinquefasciatus > Ae. aegypti. Results of combined treatment of hydrophobic
      nanosilica with temephos in larvicidal test indicated independent toxic action
      without any additive effect. This is probably the first report that demonstrated 
      that nanoparticles particularly nanosilica could be used in mosquito vector
      control.

AB  - Plant-based insecticides for vector control are urgently needed for Anopheles
      barbirostris, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes albopictus which are the primary 
      vectors of malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue, respectively, in India and 
      other South East Asian countries. In the present study, larvicidal, adulticidal, 
      and repellent activities of acetone root bark extract of Hiptage benghalensis
      were tested against the larvae and adults of the three mosquito vectors. The
      acetone root bark extracts of H. benghalensis was more effective as larvicides
      with low LC(50) (11.15-16.78 ppm) and LT50 (1.25-4.84 h at 200 and 400 ppm)
      values. Results of log probit analysis (at 95 % confidence level) and regression 
      analysis of crude acetone root bark extract of H. benghalensis revealed that
      lethal concentration (LC(50)) values gradually decreased with the exposure
      periods; lethal time (LT(50)) decreased with the concentration, and the mortality
      is positively correlated with the concentration. The order of susceptibility of
      the three mosquito species was as follows: A. albopictus > A. barbirostris > C.
      quinquefascitus. Biochemical changes were also evidenced in third instar larvae
      of three mosquito species following a sublethal exposure for 24 h. The level of
      sugar, glycogen, lipids, and proteins was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in
      larvae treated with H. benghalensis. The acetone root bark extracts of H.
      benghalensis is less toxic to adults and repelled laboratory-reared female A.
      barbirostris, A. albopictus, and C. quinquefascitus with the short median
      protection times of 57.66-135, 72.41-134.16, and 47.66-93 min, respectively. The 
      present investigation proves it as a potent larvicide against A. albopictus, A.
      barbirostris, and C. quinquefascitus, which can be recommended to control these
      mosquito species on its breeding site. However, further investigations are needed
      to confirm the lethal effects of H. benghalensis in field conditions and its
      impact on the nontarget organisms.

AB  - Vector control is a critical requirement in epidemic disease situations, as is an
      urgent need to develop new and improved mosquito control methods that are
      economical and effective yet safe for nontarget organisms and the environment.
      Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every
      year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused
      physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high
      operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control
      have been a priority in this area. In the present study, activity of silver
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Euphorbia hirta (E. hirta) plant leaf
      extract against malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (A. stephensi) was
      determined. Range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 
      and 50 ppm) and methanol crude extract (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ppm) were
      tested against larvae of A. stephensi. The synthesized AgNPs from E. hirta were
      highly toxic than methanolic crude extract against malarial vector, A. stephensi.
      The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectrum, scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction. SEM analyses of the synthesized showed
      that AgNPs, measuring 30-60 nm in size, were clearly distinguishable. The
      synthesized AgNPs showed larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure; however, the 
      highest larval mortality was found in the synthesized AgNPs against the first to 
      fourth instar larvae and pupae of values LC(50) (10.14, 16.82, 21.51, and 27.89
      ppm, respectively), LC(90) (31.98, 50.38, 60.09, and 69.94 ppm, respectively),
      and the LC(50) and LC(90) values of pupae of 34.52 and 79.76 ppm, respectively.
      Methanol extract exhibited the larval toxicity against the first to fourth instar
      larvae and pupae of values LC(50) (121.51, 145.40, 169.11, and 197.40 ppm,
      respectively), LC(90) (236.44, 293.75, 331.42, and 371.34 ppm, respectively), and
      the LC(50) and LC(90) values of pupae of 219.15 and 396.70 ppm, respectively. No 
      mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest that synthesized
      silver nanoparticles are a rapid, eco-friendly, and single-step approach; the
      AgNPs formed can be potential mosquito larvicidal agents.

TI  - Impact of changing over of insecticide from synthetic pyrethroids to DDT for
      indoor residual spray in a malaria endemic area of Orissa, India.
PG  - 382-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors
      has been a major problem for achieving effective vector control. Due to limited
      availability of insecticides, the only option is management of resistance by
      judiciously using the insecticides and rotating them to maintain their
      effectiveness. This study was carried out in a malaria endemic area of Sundergarh
      district in Orissa where synthetic pyrethroids (SP) were in use for the last
      couple of years. The change-over from SP to DDT was done in one arm of study, and
      the other two arms remained on SP and insecticide-treated nets (ITN).
      Entomological and parasitological monitoring was done to assess the impact.
      METHODS: The study design comprised of three arms (i) two rounds of indoor
      residual spraying (IRS) with DDT 1g/m(2) as a change-over insecticide in areas
      previously under synthetic pyrethroids; (ii) two rounds of IRS with synthetic
      pyrethroid (alphacypermethrin, ACM) @ 25 mg/m(2) ; and (iii) an unsprayed area
      under ITN/long lasting insecticide nets (LNs). Indoor residual spraying was
      undertaken under strict supervision to maintain quality and coverage. Contact
      bioassays were conducted to know the persistence of insecticide on sprayed
      surfaces and adult vector density was monitored in fixed and randomly selected
      houses. Malaria incidence was measured through fortnightly domiciliary
      surveillance under primary health care system in all the study villages. RESULTS:
      The insecticide susceptibility tests showed that An.culicifacies was resistant to
      DDT but susceptible to malathion and ACM. However, An. fluviatilis was
      susceptible to all the three insecticides. ACM was effective in killing An.
      culicifacies on mud and wooden sprayed surfaces and maintained effective
      bioefficacy ranging from 92 to 100 per cent up to five months, whereas DDT failed
      to achieve effective mortality in An.culicifacies. However, there was significant
      decline in the density of An.culicifacies in ACM and DDT areas in comparison to
      ITNs/LNs. There was 61 per cent reduction in the slide positivity rate in ACM
      area in comparison to 48 and 51 per cent in DDT and ITN/LNs areas, respectively. 
      The adjusted incidence rate of malaria cases per 1000 population in three study
      areas also showed significant declines within each group. INTERPRETATION &
      CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that the change-over of insecticide from
      synthetic pyrethroids to DDT brings about the same epidemiological impact as
      envisaged from continuing SP spray or distributing insecticide treated
      nets/long-lasting insecticidal nets provided there is a good quality spray and
      house coverage.

TI  - Age-dependent sex bias in clinical malarial disease in hypoendemic regions.
PG  - e35592
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0035592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Experimental models show a male bias in murine
      malaria; however, extant literature on biases in human clinical malaria is
      inconclusive. Studies in hyperendemic areas document an absence of sexual
      dimorphism in clinical malaria. Data on sex bias in clinical malaria in
      hypoendemic areas is ambiguous--some reports note a male bias but do not
      investigate the role of differential mosquito exposure in that bias. Moreover,
      these studies do not examine whether the bias is age related. This study
      investigates whether clinical malaria in hypoendemic regions exhibits a sex bias 
      and whether this bias is age-dependent. We also consider the role of vector
      exposure in this bias. METHODS: Retrospective passive clinical malaria datasets
      (2002-2007) and active surveillance datasets (2000-2009) were captured for the
      hypoendemic Mumbai region in Western India. To validate findings, passive
      retrospective data was captured from a primary malaria clinic (2006-2007) in
      hypoendemic Rourkela (Eastern India). Data was normalized by determining percent 
      slide-positivity rates (SPRs) for males and females, and parasite-positivity
      distributions were established across age groups. The Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon
      Signed Rank test, and Chi-square analysis were used to determine statistical
      significances. RESULTS: In both the Mumbai and Rourkela regions, clinical malaria
      exhibited an adult male bias (p<0.01). A sex bias was not observed in children
      aged </=10. Post-puberty, male SPRs were significantly greater than females SPRs 
      (p<0.01). This adult male bias was observed for both vivax and falciparum
      clinical disease. Analysis of active surveillance data did not reveal an age or
      sex bias in the frequency of parasite positivity. CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates an age-dependent sex bias in clinical malaria in hypoendemic regions
      and enhanced incidence of clinical malaria in males following puberty. Possible
      roles of sex hormones, vector exposure, co-infections, and other factors in this 
      enhanced susceptibility are discussed.

TI  - A novel cost-effective medium for the production of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.
      israelensis for mosquito control.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) has been used for
      mosquito-control programmes the world-wide. Indeed, the large-scale production of
      Bti for mosquito control is very expensive due to the high cost of its culture.
      In the present study, we attempted to widen the scope in developing
      cost-effective culture medium for Bti production, based on the raw materials
      available on the biosphere, including coconut cake powder, CCP (Cocos nucifera), 
      neem cake powder, NCP (Azadirachta indica) and groundnut cake powder, GCP
      (Arachis hypogea). Among these raw materials, the biomass production of Bti,
      sporulation and toxin synthesizing from 'CCP' in combination with mineral salt
      (MnCl(2)) was comfortably satisfactory. Bioassays with mosquito species (Culex
      quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti) and field trials were
      also satisfactory. The present investigation suggests that coconut cake-based
      culture medium can be used as an alternative for industrial production of Bti in 
      mosquito-control programme. Therefore, the study is very important from the point
      of effective production of Bti from cost-effective culture medium for the control
      of mosquito vectors.

TI  - Changes in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in Indian desert malaria
      vector Anopheles stephensi during aging.
PG  - 132-5
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.04.003 [doi]
AB  - Malaria parasite requires a specific time to replicate and disseminate in the
      mosquito's body before transmission to naive hosts can occur. Vector control has 
      a proven record in the prevention and control of malaria. The evaluation of
      vector control strategies requires accurate methods of predicting mosquito age.
      Anopheles stephensi is the principal malaria vector of the desert part of India. 
      The objective of this study was to correlate the age of laboratory reared and
      field collected adults of An. stephensi with the glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (g6pd) activity. The measurement of g6pd activity was carried out
      in a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The g6pd activity in the males and females An.
      stephensi was inversely proportional to their age. A significant correlation of
      the g6pd activity was recorded between the field collected and laboratory reared 
      mosquitoes. The g6pd activity in the males An. stephensi was found to be
      significantly higher than the females. The finding of the present study is useful
      for the prediction of the age of males and females An. stephensi.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy of botanical extracts against two important vector
      mosquitoes.
PG  - 386-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the larvicidal efficacy of different solvent leaf extract
      of Ervatamia coronaria and Caesalpinia pulcherrima against Anopheles subpictus
      and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty five early third
      instar larvae of Anopheles subpictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were exposed to 
      various concentrations and were assayed in the laboratory. The larval mortality
      was observed after 24 h of treatment. RESULTS: Among three solvent extracts
      tested the maximum efficacy was observed in the methanol extract. The LC50 (LC90)
      values of Ervatamia coronaria and Caesalpinia pulcherrima against early third
      instar of Anopheles subpictus were 86.47 (159.59) and 113.26 (207.73) ppm and
      Culex tritaeniorhynchus were 131.53 (245.37) and 165.28 (299.45) ppm,
      respectively. No mortality was observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: From the
      results it can be concluded the crude extract of Ervatamia coronaria and
      Caesalpinia pulcherrima were excellent potential for controlling Anopheles
      subpictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquito larvae.

PG  - 299-305
LID - 10.1016/S1995-7645(12)60043-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the mosquito larvicidal activities of hexane, chloroform,
      ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol leaf extract of Orthosiphon thymiflorus (O.
      thymiflorus) against Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi), Culex quinquefasciatus 
      (Cx. quinquefasciatus) and Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). METHODS: The larvicidal
      activity was assayed against three mosquito species at various concentrations
      ranging from (50-450 ppm) under the laboratory conditions. The LC(50) and LC(90) 
      value of the O. thymiflorus leaf extract was determined by Probit analysis.
      RESULTS: The LC(50) values of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone and
      methanol extract of O. thymiflorus third instar larvae of An. stephensi were
      LC(50)= 201.39, 178.76, 158.06, 139.22 and 118.74 ppm; Cx. quinquefasciatus were 
      LC(50)=228.13, 209.72, 183.35, 163.55 and 149.96 ppm and Ae. aegypti were
      LC(50)=215.65, 197.91, 175.05, 154.80 and 137.26 ppm, respectively. Maximum
      larvicidal activity was observed in the methanolic extract followed by acetone,
      ethyl acetate chloroform and hexane extract. The larval mortality was observed
      after 24 h exposure. No mortality was observed in control. CONCLUSIONS: The
      present results suggest that the effective plant crude extracts have potential to
      be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquito vectors.
      This study provides the first report on the larvicidal activity of this plant
      crude solvent extract of against An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae.
      aegypti mosquitoes.

TI  - Malaria in seasonal migrant population in Southern Gujarat, India.
PG  - 638-45
AB  - Malaria in migrant workers is always a major problem to control due to their
      temporary stay in shelters, and other operational constraints. Hence, a study was
      undertaken in brick kilns in Bharuch district, Gujarat state, India to study the 
      problem of malaria in the work force. Mass blood surveys were carried out in 15
      brick kilns. Blood slides were collected from both febrile and afebrile cases.
      Positive cases were treated as per the national drug policy and were followed up.
      Mosquito collections were carried out by pyrethrum spray collection in early
      morning hours. Human blood index and sporozoite rates were determined as per
      standard procedures. All age groups were found affected with malaria at brick
      kilns. Prevalence of malaria was significantly higher in </= 14 years of
      age-group as compared to adults. Post treatment follow up examination of patients
      revealed high malaria infection due to non-compliance of chloroquine. The
      appearance of parasitaemia among Plasmodium falciparum treated cases indicate the
      possibility of chloroquine resistance. The proportion of P. falciparum was >50%
      in migrant population. In stable population in villages, overall decline in
      malaria cases was observed in 2008-2010. The sporozoite rate of 4.2% in Anopheles
      culicifacies indicates active malaria transmission at brick kilns. The
      investigation demonstrated that suitable microclimatic conditions for malaria
      transmission exist in these areas during hottest period. The district health
      department should consider these factors in planning malaria surveillance and
      control. As current magnitude and diversity of population movements in rural as
      well as in urban areas are unprecedented, this issue is worthy of attention.

TI  - Genetic population structure of the malaria vector Anopheles baimaii in
      north-east India using mitochondrial DNA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles baimaii is a primary vector of human malaria in the forest 
      settings of Southeast Asia including the north-eastern region of India. Here, the
      genetic population structure and the basic population genetic parameters of An.
      baimaii in north-east India were estimated using DNA sequences of the
      mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase sub unit II (COII) gene. METHODS: Anopheles
      baimaii were collected from 26 geo-referenced locations across the seven
      north-east Indian states and the COII gene was sequenced from 176 individuals
      across these sites. Fifty-seven COII sequences of An. baimaii from six locations 
      in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand from a previous study were added to this
      dataset. Altogether, 233 sequences were grouped into eight population groups, to 
      facilitate analyses of genetic diversity, population structure and population
      history. RESULTS: A star-shaped median joining haplotype network, unimodal
      mismatch distribution and significantly negative neutrality tests indicated
      population expansion in An. baimaii with the start of expansion estimated to be
      ~0.243 million years before present (MYBP) in north-east India. The populations
      of An. baimaii from north-east India had the highest haplotype and nucleotide
      diversity with all other populations having a subset of this diversity, likely as
      the result of range expansion from north-east India. The north-east Indian
      populations were genetically distinct from those in Bangladesh, Myanmar and
      Thailand, indicating that mountains, such as the Arakan mountain range between
      north-east India and Myanmar, are a significant barrier to gene flow. Within
      north-east India, there was no genetic differentiation among populations with the
      exception of the Central 2 population in the Barail hills area that was
      significantly differentiated from other populations. CONCLUSIONS: The high
      genetic distinctiveness of the Central 2 population in the Barail hills area of
      the north-east India should be confirmed and its epidemiological significance
      further investigated. The lack of genetic population structure in the other
      north-east Indian populations likely reflects large population sizes of An.
      baimaii that, historically, were able to disperse through continuous forest
      habitats in the north-east India. Additional markers and analytical approaches
      are required to determine if recent deforestation is now preventing ongoing gene 
      flow. Until such information is acquired, An. baimaii in north-east India should 
      be treated as a single unit for the implementation of vector control measures.
