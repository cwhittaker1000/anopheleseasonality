Abstract = {{As part of investigations on potential linkages between irrigation and
   malaria transmission, all surface water bodies in and around three
   villages along an irrigation distributary in South Punjab, Pakistan,
   were surveyed for anopheline mosquito larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) from
   April 1999 to March 2000. Samples were characterized according to
   exposure to sunlight, substratum, presence of vegetation, fauna,
   inorganic matter and physical water condition (clear/turbid/foul). Also
   water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), electroconductivity (EC) and
   pH of sites were recorded. A total of 37 982 Anopheles larvae of six
   morphological types were collected from 2992 samples taken from
   irrigation/agricultural and village/domestic aquatic habitats. Anopheles
   subpictus Grassi sensu lato was by far the most abundant (74.3\%),
   followed by An. culicifacies Giles s.l. (4.1\%), An. stephensi Liston
   s.l. (2.6\%), An. pulcherrimus Theobald (1.8\%), An. peditaeniatus
   Leicester (0.3\%) and An. nigerrimus Giles (0.1\%). The four most
   abundant species were significantly associated with waterlogged fields
   and communal village drinking-water tanks. Habitat characteristics most
   correlated with occurrence of anophelines were the physical water
   condition and the absence/presence of fauna, particularly predators.
   Occurrence and abundance of Anopheles immatures were not significantly
   correlated with water temperature, DO, EC or pH, Malaria vectors of the
   Anopheles culicifacies complex occurred at relatively low densities,
   mainly in irrigated and waterlogged fields. In South Punjab, where
   rainfall is very low, it should be possible to reduce anopheline
   breeding through water management, as larvae develop mainly in water
   bodies that are directly or indirectly related to the extensive
   canal-irrigation system.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate the vectorial capacity of Anopheles dirus, the main vector
   of forest malaria in the northeastern region of India, in order to gain
   an understanding of entomological factors related to malaria
   transmission in forest-fringe areas of Assam, India, an isolated village
   in the tropical rain forest-fringed area in the district of Dibrugarh,
   Assam, under the influence of An. dirus alone was studied. Data on
   various entomological variables required for computation of the
   vectorial capacity were generated in each month from June 1999 to May
   2000 in the field using standard techniques. Malaria prevalence was also
   studied during the same period in the study village and correlated with
   the estimated vectorial capacity of An. dirus. Vectorial capacity of An.
   dirus was highest, 0.779 for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and 0.649 for
   Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), during the hot-monsoon season
   (June-September) and decreased to 0.08 (Pv) and 0.07(Pf) in the
   temperate postmonsoon season (October-November) before attaining zero
   values in the cool-dry season (December-February). With increasing
   temperature in the temperate premonsoon season (March-May), vectorial
   capacity recorded was 0.119 and 0.82 for Pv and Pf, respectively.
   Significant positive correlation was seen between the estimated
   vectorial capacity of An. dirus and the number of new Pf (r = 0.86, p <
   0.001) and Pv (r = 0.69, p < 0.02) cases in the study village in
   different months. Thus, this study highlights the pattern of malaria
   transmission by An. dirus in a forest-fringe area of Assam that begins
   in March, peaks in July/August, subsides by November, and remains
   interrupted between December and February. Measures for controlling
   malaria in forest-fringe areas should be scheduled accordingly.}},

   Overall, 6478 female mosquitoes were collected in about 176 man-hours

   the mosquitoes collected, 96\% of the microfilaraemic subjects and 69\%
   of the endemic normal subjects had antibodies against thoracic proteins
   of this species (almost 50\% of all the sera having high titres of such

   always at very low titres, in 84\% of the microfilaraemic subjects and

   Anopheles annularis was the predominant species in the head-end villages
   and its abundance was directly related to the opening of the canal,

   villages, where irrigation is limited. Anopheles culicifacies showed 2
   typical peaks not related to canal irrigation. Site-related differences
   in species prevalence were significant in both immatures and adults.
   Malaria infection was due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.
   The annual parasite incidence in children and adults was significantly
   higher in head-end villages (>4-fold) as compared to that in tail-end
   villages. However, seasonal trends in the prevalence of P. falciparum

   An. stephensi Liston (40\%) and An. culicifacies Giles (36\%). When
   fourth-instar larvae were exposed, the infection was highest in Ar.
   subalbatus (66\%), followed by An. stephensi (52\%), Cx.
   quinquefasciatus (47\%), Ae. aegypti and An. subpictus (42\%), Ae.
   albopictus (30\%), An. culicifacies (29\%), Cx. sitiens (24\%), Cx.
   tritaeniorhynchus (19\%) and Ma. annulifera (8\%), with 2-45\% of
   infected culicines surviving to adulthood. The parasitic phase of the
   nematode lasted 5-7 days in all the host species, yielding 1.1-3.2
   parasites per II instar and 1.1-2.5 parasites per IV instar. The overall
   output of parasites per 100 mosquito larvae (infected + uninfected) was
   highest for Ae. aegypti when mosquitoes were exposed during II instar
   (2.53 parasites/larva) and for Ar. subalbatus when mosquitoes were
   exposed during IV instar (1.65/larva), and lowest for Ma. annulifera
   exposed during IV instar (0.09/larva). For routine laboratory culture of
   R. iyengari it is convenient to employ Cx. quinquefasciatus as the host
   yielding 90-190 parasites/100 larva.}},

Abstract = {{In Sri Lanka, malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles culicifacies
   Giles sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae). In India, this nominal taxon
   comprises sibling species A, B, C, D and E, distinguished by their
   chromosome morphology. Species B (identified by polytene chromosome
   sequence Xab, 2g(1) + h(1)) is not such an efficient vector of malaria
   as other members of the An. culicifacies complex in India. All specimens
   of An. culicifacies s.l. examined from Sri Lanka possess Xab, 2g(1) +
   h(1) polytenes, previously interpreted as species B, despite their
   important vector status. Recently, species E was described from
   Rameshwaram Island (Tamil Nadu, India) between Sri Lanka and the Indian
   mainland, where both species B and E are sympatric. Species B and E
   share polytene sequence Xab, 2g(1) + h(1) but differ by the mitotic
   Y-chromosome being acrocentric in species B, submetacentric in species
   E, the latter implicated as vector of vivax malaria. From May 1999 to
   January 2000, we surveyed Y-chromosomes of male progeny from An.
   culicifacies Xab, 2g(1) + h(1) females collected from cattle bait in
   diverse malarious districts of Sri Lanka: Badulla, Monaragala, Puttalam
   and Trincomalee. Karyotypes of readable quality were obtained from 42/83
   families examined, with overall proportions 24\% acrocentric and 76\%
   submetacentric Y-chromosome carriers, both types being sympatric in at
   least 3/4 localities sampled. By analogy with the situation on
   Rameshwaram Island, we interpret these observations to demonstrate
   widespread presence of two members of the An. culicifacies complex in
   Sri Lanka, their karyotypes being compatible with species B and E, the
   latter predominant and having greater vector potential.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria has declined around Chilika Lake (85 degrees 20' E, 19 degrees
   40' N) in Orissa State, India, from hyperendemicity in the 1930s to
   hypoendemicity during recent decades. Six decades ago, 21 spp. of
   Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were recorded from this area,
   including the well known Indian malaria vectors An. culicifacies Giles,
   An. fluviatilis James, An. maculatus Theobald, An. stephensi Liston and
   An. sundaicus (Rodenwaldt), the last formerly regarded as the main
   vector locally. Surveys of Chilika area during 1995-96 found 8 spp. of
   culicine plus 14 spp. of anopheline mosquitoes, the latter comprising
   An. subpictus Grassi sensu lato, An. hyrcanus (Pallas) s.l., An. vagus
   Donitz, An. annularis van der Wulp s.l., An. culicifacies Giles s.l.,

   James, An. pallidus Theobald, An. tessellatus Theobald and An. karwari
   James in decreasing order of abundance. Among indoor-resting female
   mosquitoes, the anthropophilic index was 4-7\% and some species (An.
   culicifacies, An. subpictus, An. vagus) tended to enter houses for
   resting after blood-feeding outside. Females of potentially infective
   age (three-parous) were obtained for An. culicifacies (11\%) and An.
   annularis (< 2\%), the more abundant established vector in this coastal
   area, but not for small samples of An. subpictus and An. vagus.
   Anophelines reported previously but not found in our survey were An.
   fluviatilis, An. jamesii Theobald, A. maculatus, An. splendidus

Abstract = {{One hypothesis to explain the southern extension of Japanese
   encephalitis (IE) virus from Papua New Guinea into the Torres Strait
   islands in 1995 and to mainland Australia in 1998 is the dispersal of
   infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex annulirostris Skuse from which
   JE virus has been isolated repeatedly. To investigate whether this
   species disperses in this manner, mosquitoes were identified from 368
   aerial kite trap collections operated at 50-310 m (altitude) at inland
   New South Wales between November 1979 to December 1984. Forty samples (9
   during daylight and 31 at night) contained mosquitoes, of which 221
   could be identified as Culex australicus Dobrotworsky \& Drummond
   (58.8\%), Culex annulirostris (21.3\%), Anopheles annulipes Walker s.l.
   (10.4\%), Aedes theobaldi (Taylor) (7.2\%), Aedes rubrithorax (Macquart)
   (1.4\%), and Aedes sagax (Skuse) (<0.9\%). During the night, mosquitoes
   were found in 22.6\% of the collections at a mean density (+/-SD) of
   91.3 +/- 151.7/10(6) m(3) of air sampled. During the day, only 3.8\%
   were positive at a mean density 125.3 +/- 152.1. When examined in
   relation to possible flying time and wind speed, mean +/- SD dispersal
   distances by day and night were 23.9 +/- 15.3 km and 152.4 +/- 116.3
   km,respectively. These data provide circumstantial evidence that aerial
   carriage southward <approximate to> 200 km from Papua New Guinea to Cape
   York peninsula is feasible, but that southern dispersal of Murray Valley
   encephalitis virus infected mosquitoes from tropical to temperate
   Australia is unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature (16, 22, 28, 37 degrees C) on effects of
   permethrin was investigated for susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant
   strains of the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and An. stephensi (Diptera:
   Culicidae). Young unfed female adult mosquitoes were exposed to 0.25\%
   permethrin test papers or to polyester netting treated with permethrin
   500mg a.i./m(2). The time to 50\% knock-down (KT50) declined as
   temperature increased, i.e. there was a positive temperature coefficient
   of this effect of the pyrethroid. Resistance ratios (comparing KT50
   values) between resistant and susceptible An. stephensi ranged between
   2.5 and 4.4 at the different temperatures. Comparative tests of
   pyrethroid tolerance of different strains would be valid over the 22-28
   degrees C range but, when using a discriminating dose to detect
   resistance, more precise temperature control is desirable.
   Mortality 24h after exposure to 0.25\% permethrin of both susceptible
   and resistant strains of Art. stephensi showed a negative correlation
   with temperature between 16 and 22 degrees C and a positive correlation
   at higher temperatures. In An. gambiae, however, the correlation was
   positive over the whole range.
   Irritancy of permethrin-treated netting to Anopheles females (measured
   as time lapse until first flight take-off, and the number of take-offs
   during 7.5min exposure) was positively correlated with temperature in
   all four strains and was much greater for the susceptible than the

Abstract = {{The largest river-valley development to be proposed in India is that in
   the Narmada valley. The building of the Bargi dam, a multi-purpose
   irrigation and hydro-electric project, in Jabalpur, in central India,
   formed part of the first phase of the development of this valley
   (1974-1988). Many villages and several hectares of land in three
   districts were submerged as the waters rose behind the dam, the worst
   affected area being the catchment area of the primary health centre
   (PHC) at Narayanganj, in Mandla district. Until recently, cases of
   malaria were relatively rare in Narayanganj. However, an epidemic of
   malaria in late 1996 claimed hundreds of lives in the area and the
   outbreak spread, during 1997, to new villages in the region. A review of
   the records collected by the National Malaria Eradication Programme
   (NMEP) not only indicated that the slide positivity rate (SPR) for
   Narayanganj increased > 7.45-fold between 1979 and 1997 but also that
   the slide falciparum rate (SFR) increased > 32-fold over the same
   period. The NMEP data available for Mandla district as a whole indicated
   a doubling in mean SPR and SFR between 1979 and 1997. There is no
   evidence that a new species of vector has established since 1979. In
   fact, indoor-resting densities of anophelines and of the most
   established vector, Anopheles culicifacies; have fallen since the dam
   was built, but densities of another vector, An. fluviatilis, have
   increased.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria and tick-borne borreliosis are two vector-borne diseases whose
   epidemiology in Africa has been affected by climatic changes observed
   since the early 1970's. In the case of Borrelia crocidurae relapsing
   fever; the persistence ofsub-Saharan drought has been associated with a
   spread of the tick vector Alectorobius sonrai which was previously
   restricted to the Sahara and the Sahel. Now the disease has a high
   incidence in the Sudan savanna of West Africa where if was previously
   absent. In the case of malaria, drought has significantly reduced the
   distribution, abundance, or infection rate of anopheline vectors in
   these areas. However; the decrease of malaria transmission has had no
   significant impact on morbidity and mortality because of the specific
   modalities of naturally acquired immunity to malaria. In parts of the
   world where malaria is unstable or has been eradicated, global worming
   cannot by itself increase or reintroduce malaria, since other factors
   play a much more important role in the epidemiology and control of
   malaria. However the marked climatic anomalies which are observed some
   years may locally contribute to the occurrence of epidemics, as has been
   observed in limited areas of Southern and Central America, Southern Asia
   and Eastern Africa in relation to El Nino Southern Oscillation. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The Indian National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP) is reporting
   2.5 to 3 million malaria cases, and about 1,000 malarial deaths
   annually. Malaria in the northeastern states is stable and in the
   peninsular India unstable. There are six major and three minor malaria
   vectors, of which Anopheles culicifacies transmits malaria in rural
   areas and An. stephensi in the towns. Other vectors are of local
   importance. Plasmodium vivax is the dominant infection and accounts for
   60-65\% cases whereas P. falciparum contributes 30-35\% cases. Field
   operations to control malaria are impeded by resistance and/or exophilic
   vector behavior, parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs, operational
   problems in spraying, failure to search breeding of mosquitoes at weekly
   intervals, staff shortages and financial constraints. Resurgent malaria
   invaded new ecotypes created by green revolution, industrial growth and
   urban development resulting in paradigm shift towards man-made malaria.

   a significant reduction in vector density as assessed by morning indoor
   resting catches, man-biting rate, light trapping, the proportion of

   villages with untreated or no nets. No statistically significant

   introduction of the indigenous larvivorous fish Aplocheilus blocki in
   major breeding habitats of Anopheles srephensi replaced ongoing DDT

Abstract = {{Background In August, 1997, a woman with no history of travel to
   malarious regions developed Plasmodium vivax malaria. She lived in a
   rural area of Italy where indigenous Anophyles labranchiae mosquitoes
   were present.
   Methods and findings An environmental investigation was done within a 3
   km radius of the patient's house. Adult mosquitoes and larvae were
   collected and examined by PCR with the gene for plasmodium
   circumsporozoite protein as target. About 200 people living in the area
   were interviewed to detect possible carriers of P vivax.
   Findings None of the mosquitoes captured were carrying any malarial
   organisms. The house-to-house investigation identified a 7-year-old girl
   who had had a feverish illness a few days after her arrival in Italy
   from India, and who, 3 months later, still had P vivax in her blood; she
   and her mother had antimalarial antibodies.
   Interpretation These investigations suggest that the index case of
   malaria was caused by local anopheline mosquitoes infected with
   exogenous P vivax.}},

Abstract = {{The uptake of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae (Mf) by Culex
   quinquefasciatus and their development in relation to human Mf density
   were quantified by allowing a total of 1096 wild mosquitoes to feed on
   13 volunteers sleeping under partially open bed-nets. For each
   volunteer, each hour between 18.00 and 06.00 h the Mf density in
   finger-prick blood was determined and engorged mosquitoes collected.
   Each hourly collection of mosquitoes was kept separately. Half of them
   was dissected within 18 h post-feeding for the presence of ingested Mf,
   the other half was reared for 12 days to allow for the development of L3
   larvae. About 20\% of the latter mosquitoes died during these 12 days
   and these harboured significantly more larvae than the surviving ones,
   which could be an indication of excess-mortality among heavily infected
   mosquitoes. Assuming that variability in Mf uptake and in the number of
   developed L3 larvae can be described by a negative binomial
   distribution, a maximum-likelihood procedure was applied to estimate the
   relationship between human Mf density and both the arithmetic mean Mf
   uptake and L3 development. Both were adequately described by a
   saturating hyperbolic function that significantly differed from
   linearity. The saturation level for Mf was estimated at 29 (CI: 20-54)
   and for L3 larvae at 6.6 (CI: 4.3-17.0). Next, the L3 yield was related
   to Mf uptake indicating that the W. bancrofti-C. quinquefasciatus
   complex shows `limitation', i.e. a decreasing yield for an increasing
   uptake. Both the number of Mf ingested and the number of L3 larvae
   developing per mosquito were found to be highly aggregated, with the
   level of aggregation decreasing in a non-linear way with human Mf
   density.}},

   patient with gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite discovered

   In 1911 Ross approached malaria by means of a
   mathematical-epidemiological method. Already at that time he thought of
   eradicating the vector. Later it appeared that this was not achievable.

Abstract = {{The possibility of controlling vector-borne disease through the
   development and release of transgenic insect vectors has recently gained
   popular support and is being actively pursued by a number of research
   laboratories around the world. Several technical problems must be solved
   before such a strategy could be implemented: genes encoding refractory
   traits (traits that render the insect unable to transmit the pathogen)
   must be identified, a transformation system for important vector species
   has to be developed, and a strategy to spread the refractory trait into
   natural vector populations must be designed. Recent advances in this
   field of research make it seem likely that this technology will be
   available in the near future.
   In this paper we review recent progress in this area as well as argue
   that care should be taken in selecting the most appropriate disease
   system with which to first attempt this form of intervention. Much
   attention is currently being given to the application of this technology
   to the control of malaria, transmitted by Anopheles gambiae in Africa.
   While malaria is undoubtedly the most important vector-borne disease in
   the world and its control should remain an important goal, we maintain
   that the complex epidemiology of malaria together with the intense
   transmission rates in Africa may make it unsuitable for the first
   application of this technology. Diseases such as African
   trypanosomiasis, transmitted by the tsetse fly, or unstable malaria in
   India may provide more appropriate initial targets to evaluate the
   potential of this form of intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Cuticular lipids were extracted in hexane from the females of four
   strains of Anopheles stephensi and separated by capillary gas
   chromatography. When the chromatograms produced were quantified and

   from `Beech' from India and `St Mal' from Pakistan, both of which were
   resistant to DDT and malathion. A high degree of hydrocarbon segregation
   between each of the four strains might be associated with geographical
   variation.
   It appears that there are significant and real differences in the
   hydrocarbons of these strains and these may be at least partially
   related to genetic alterations resulting from prior insecticide
   exposure. However, far more analysis is required if any relationship

Abstract = {{An insecticide impregnated fabric (IIF) trap was developed at the Vector
   Control Research Centre, India. The mosquito sampling efficiency of this
   new trap, relative to hand catches of indoor resting mosquitoes, was
   evaluated in human dwellings and cattle sheds in a filariasis endemic
   area. The predominant species collected in human dwellings was Culex
   quinquefasciatus Say, a vector of bancroftian filariasis; whereas
   mosquitoes of the Culex vishnui group Theobald and Anopheles subpictus
   Grassi were caught in relatively greater numbers in cattle sheds. The
   numbers of mosquitoes in the trap were significantly correlated with the
   numbers caught in hand catches, and the numbers of mosquitoes collected
   per two traps per day in the three habitats during the study period were
   1.79, 0.95 and 2.27x those collected by hand-catches. The number of
   occasions on which mosquitoes were detected by both methods was
   comparable. There was no evidence for a systematic difference in the
   age-structure and parasite distribution between the two sampling
   methods, suggesting that the trap is able to monitor both insect vectors
   and parasite infections. Therefore, the calculation of infection and
   infectivity rates necessary to monitor filariasis transmission should be
   possible from the IIF trap in filariasis endemic areas where control

Abstract = {{The Thar Desert region in north-western India is traditionally
   understood to be only mildly prone to malaria. During the last six
   decades, a major part of this arid zone has undergone vast physiographic
   and climatic changes, resulting in the formation of extensive mosquito
   breeding habitats of varying nature, high vector densities and intrusion
   of new malaria mosquitoes earlier unknown for the region. As a result,
   the prevalence of disease in the desert, with several epidemics reported
   in the last 10 years, has changed a great deal for the worse. It is
   evident from data for the period 1961-1994 that not only has the slide
   positivity rate in the desert region increased 3.5-fold, but Plasmodium
   falciparum incidence also increased as much. Along with Anopheles
   stephensi, the traditional malaria vector in the xeric environment,
   another significant vector of the Indian mainland, An. culicifacies, has
   also established itself in the areas extensively irrigated through
   canals. A review of the malaria situation in the State, particularly

Abstract = {{In a developing country like India, classification and identification of
   the species of Anopheline mosquitoes in control operations of
   mosquito-borne diseases is of paramount importance. The WHO monograph,

   principles of ID3 algorithm, a novel rule-based system, for the fast
   identification of unknown species ofmdian Anopheline mosquitoes, is
   developed. The rule-based system is user friendly, menu-driven and even
   a novice can make use of it in the identification of the unknown species
   with little practice. The above software is available on Poppy disk and
   can be obtained with a minimum cost. This program can be ported on

   the villages in forest, whereas malaria infection was mainly due to
   Plasmodium vivax in the villages away from forest. The annual parasite
   incidence was high in the villages in forest. The failure to control

Abstract = {{Malaria was nearly eradicated from India in the early 1960s but the
   disease has re-emerged as a major public health problem. Early set backs
   in malaria eradication coincided with DDT shortages. Later In the 1960s
   and 1970s malaria resurgence was the result of technical, financial and
   operational problems. In the late 1960s malaria cases in urban areas
   started to multiply, and upsurge of malaria was widespread. As a result
   in 1976, 6.45 million cases were recorded by the National Malaria
   Eradication Programme (NMEP), highest since resurgence. The
   implementation of urban malaria scheme (UMS) in 1971-72 and the modified
   plan of operation (MPO) in 1977 improved the malaria situation for 5-6
   yr. Malaria cases were reduced to about 2 million. The Impact was mainly
   on vivax malaria. Easy availability of drugs under the MPO prevented
   deaths due to malaria and reduced morbidity, a peculiar feature of
   malaria during the resurgence. The Plasmodium falciparum containment
   programme (PfCP) launched in 1977 to contain the spread of falciparum
   malaria reduced falciparum malaria in the areas where the containment
   programme was operated but its general spread could not be contained. P.
   falciparum showed a steady upward trend during the 1970s and thereafter.
   Rising trend of malaria was facilitated by developments in various
   sectors to improve the national economy under successive 5 year plans.
   Malaria at one time a rural disease, diversified under the pressure of
   developments into various ecotypes. These ecotypes have been identified
   as forest malaria, urban malaria, rural malaria, industrial malaria,
   border malaria and migration malaria; the tatter cutting across
   boundaries of various epidemiological types. Further, malaria in the
   1990s has returned with new features not witnessed during the
   pre-eradication days. These are the vector resistance to insecticide(s);
   pronounced exophilic vector behaviour; extensive vector breeding grounds
   created principally by the water resource development projects,
   urbanization and industrialization; change in parasite formula in favour
   of P. falciparum, resistance in P. falciparum to chloroquine and other
   anti-malarial drugs; and human resistance to chemical control of
   vectors. Malaria control has become a complex enterprise, and its
   management requires decentralization and approaches based on local
   transmission involving multi-sectoral action and community
   participation.}},

Abstract = {{Of the 20 Anopheles species caught in villages in Sonapur, Assam, only
   An. minimus was incriminated as a malaria vector by finding sporozoites
   in the salivary glands. It was found to be endophagic and endophilic in
   Assam and because its biting peaked after midnight it was a suitable
   target for insecticide impregnated bednets. After the withdrawal of DDT
   spraying and collecting a year's baseline data, deltamethrin impregnated
   nets were distributed in 3 villages, untreated nets were distributed in
   6 villages and 3 were held as untreated controls. The population of each
   of these groups of villages was about 1700. The nets were well received
   by the local tribal population. Human landing catches with baits
   unprotected or under partially lifted nets showed that the nets provided
   a high degree of personal protection against all the local species of
   human biting mosquito. In addition, there was evidence for suppression
   of the An. minimus population in a village with treated nets. Malaria
   was monitored by weekly active surveillance in all the villages. In the
   untreated control villages the slide positivity rate and monthly
   parasite index rose significantly during the trial. In the villages with
   untreated nets, these parameters showed no significant change, but in
   the villages with treated nets they declined significantly. On the basis
   of these results, the widespread distribution of impregnated nets was
   recommended to the state health authorities.}},

   significant reduction in populations of anopheline pupae.  Neem-based
   formulations coated over urea significantly increased grain yield, but

Abstract = {{Seven species of malaria naturally infect eight species of macaques in

   relatively benign. The proved or probable vectors of macaque malaria are
   seven species of mosquitoes that belong to the Leucosphyrus Group of the
   genus Anopheles. The geographic distribution of macaque malaria
   apparently is determined by the distribution of the Leucosphyrus Group
   of mosquitoes, which in turn apparently is determined by the
   distribution of tropical evergreen rain forest. Experimental infections
   with three species of macaque malaria frequently are lethal to
   populations or species of macaques that inhabit areas outside the
   geographic ranges of the parasites. In populations or species of
   macaques that are sympatric with experimentally virulent species of
   malaria, partial resistance probably evolved as a consequence of natural

   appreciably low levels in many localities of Pondicherry town, but its
   impact on overall microfilaraemia prevalence was only limited. However,
   prevalence of infection was reduced drastically in children born after

Abstract = {{Vector-borne diseases are an increasing cause of death and suffering
   worldwide. Efforts to control these diseases have been focused on the
   use of chemical pesticides, but arthropod resistance (whether
   physiological, biochemical, or behavioral) to pesticides is now an
   immense practical problem. The pharmacokinetic interactions of
   pesticides with arthropods, mechanisms of resistance, and the strengths
   and shortcomings of different resistance test methods are briefly
   reviewed. Using malaria control as an example, the differences between
   the efficacy of insecticide-sprayed houses in reducing malaria
   transmission, and the actual effect of such treatments on vectors are
   discussed. Reduced malaria transmission as a result of spraying house
   walls occurs through some combination of killing vectors that land on
   sprayed walls (insecticidal effect) and by preventing vectors from
   entering or remaining inside long enough to bite (behavioral effects).
   Both insecticidal and behavioral effects of insecticides are important,
   but the relative importance of one versus the other is controversial.
   Field studies in Africa, India, Brazil, and Mexico provide persuasive
   evidence for strong behavioral avoidance of DDT by the primary vector
   species. This avoidance behavior, exhibited when malaria vectors avoid
   insecticides by not entering or by rapidly exiting sprayed houses,
   should raise serious questions about the overall value of current
   physiological and biochemical resistance tests. The continued efficacy
   of DDT in Africa, India, Brazil, and Mexico, where 69\% of all reported
   cases of malaria occur and where vectors are physiologically resistant
   to DDT (excluding Brazil), serves as one indicator that repellency is
   very important in preventing indoor transmission of malaria. This
   experience with DDT has implications for future control efforts because
   pyrethroids also stimulate avoidance behaviors in arthropods. Each
   chemical should be studied early (before broad-scale use) to define
   types of action against vector species by geographic area, especially
   for impregnated bed net applications. The problems for vector control
   created by use of insecticides in agriculture and the potential for
   management of resistance in both agriculture and vector-borne disease
   control are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Three organophosphorus compounds- malathion, folithion and temephos- and
   two synthetic pyrethroids- alphamethrin and deltamethrin- were used for
   monitoring the susceptibility status of larvae and adults of six vector
   mosquitoe species: Culex quinquefasciatus (Filariasis) and Aedes
   albopictus (Dengue) (both laboratory and field strains); laboratory
   strains of Aedes aegypti (Dengue), Anopheles stephensi and Anopheles
   culicifacies (Malaria), and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (Japanese
   encephalitis) in India. From the LC50 values obtained for these
   insecticides, it was found that all mosquito species including the field
   strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus were highly
   susceptible Except for Cx. quinquefasciatus (field strain) against
   malathion, 100\% mortality was observed at the discriminating dosages
   recommended by World Health Organization. The residual effect of
   alphamethrin, deltamethrin, malathion and folithion at 25 Mg (ai)/M2 on
   different surfaces against six species of vector mosquitoes showed that
   alphamethrin was the most effective on all four treated surfaces (mud,
   plywood, cement and thatch). Nevertheless, residual efficacy lasted
   longer on thatch than on the other surfaces. Therefore, synthetic
   pyrethroids such as alphamethrin can be effectively employed in
   integrated vector control operations.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative understanding of the transmission dynamics of lymphatic
   filarial parasites is essential for the rational planning of control
   strategies. One of the most important determinants of transmission
   dynamics is the relationship between parasite yield, the success rate of
   ingested microfilariae (mf) becoming infective larvae in a mosquito
   vector, and mf density in the source of the human blood meal. Three
   types of relationship have been recognized in human filaria/mosquito
   couples-limitation, facilitation and proportionality; facilitation has
   hitherto been observed only in the couple Wuchereria bancrofti/Anopheles
   gambiae in Burkina Faso, in experimental studies on a high density mf
   carrier. The present paper demonstrates facilitation in W. bancrofti/An.
   gambiae and W. bancrofti/An. arabiensis in lower mf density carriers in
   The Gambia and Tanzania, and in W. bancrofti/An. funestus in Tanzania.
   Facilitation was not found in An. melas in The Gambia nor in An. merus
   in Tanzania. Analysis of published data shows limitation at low level mf
   densities in W. bancrofti/Culex quinquefasciatus in Sri Lanka, and in
   the same couple in India. Limitation also occurs in Brugia malayi/Aedes
   togoi in experimental cats; proportionality occurs in B. malayi/Mansonia
   bonneae in Malaysia. The epidemiological significance of these
   host/parasite relationships is discussed, and supporting evidence for
   its validity is presented from the published results of large-scale
   control programmes.}},

   Intradermal (ID) tests with the mosquito whole body extract (WBE) were
   performed on 247 patients with bronchial asthma and/or rhinitis and 50
   healthy nonallergic volunteers.  Of these 247 patients, 118 (47.8\%) had
   positive (1+ to 4+) reactions including 72 (29.1\%) with markedly
   positive (2+ to 4+) ID reactions.  We did not observe any 2+ to 4+ skin
   reactions in normal healthy volunteers, giving evidence for the
   specificity of markedly positive ID response.  The skin test positivity
   was not influenced by various clinical characteristics (age at onset,
   duration and type of disease, and family history) of patients included
   in the study.  The specificity of positive ID response was further
   supported by the results of mosquito RAST with the sera of 14 patients. 
   Ten of the 12 sera (83\%) from patients with positive ID response to
   mosquito WBE were RAST positive.  Sera from two patients with negative
   ID reactions were RAST negative.  The bronchial provocation tests (BPTs)
   were uniformly negative in all five healthy volunteers and two patients
   showing negative ID responses to mosquito WBE, while the three patients
   showing 2+ to 4+ responses gave positive BPTs.  Our results suggest that
   mosquito-derived particles are important inhalant allergens in the
   etiology of IgE-mediated respiratory allergic disorders in India.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Field surveys of mosquito larval sites on the Pacific coastal plain
   and foothill regions of southern Chiapas, Mexico were carried out in the
   dry and wet seasons of 1988.  The sites were a priori classified into
   nine habitat categories.  At each site, samples for the two principal
   malaria vectors, Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann and A. pseudopunctipennis
   Theobald, were taken and seventeen environmental factors were measured
   or estimated.
   (2) Canonical correspondence analysis combined with a Monte Carlo
   permutation test revealed significant dependence of mosquito larval
   occurrence on environmental factors and habitat categories in the dry
   season and on environmental factors only in the wet season.
   (3) G-test of independence and association index Q indicated a positive
   association between the habitat category `flooded or irrigated pastures'
   and A. albimanus occurrence in both seasons, and positive association
   between `estuaries' and A. albimanus occurrence in the dry season.  The
   occurrence of A. albimanus was negatively associated with the habitat
   category `foothills' in both seasons, and negatively associated with the
   category `estuaries' in the wet season.
   (4) In the dry season, the abundance of phytoplankton and cover of
   floating macrophytes were significantly greater for sampling sites where
   A. albimanus was present.  Concentrations of K+, Ca2+ and PO4-P and
   amount of phytoplankton were significantly higher and the amount of
   filamentous algae significantly lower for A. albimanus positive sites in
   the wet season.  Altitude and the amount of filamentous algae were
   significantly higher, and Na+ concentration was significantly lower for
   sampling sites positive for A. pseudopunctipennis in the dry season.  In
   the wet season, the mean abundance of filamentous algae in sites with A.
   pseudopunctipennis was significantly higher than in sites where this
   species was absent.
   (5) In general, the habitat classification used seems to have higher
   predictive power in the dry season than in the wet season, and several
   quantified environmental factors appear promising as predictors of
   anopheline larval occurrence in both seasons.}},

Abstract = {{In Orissa State, India, the double gel diffusion technique was used to
   analyze 97,405 bloodmeals of all fed anophelines that were caught during
   standardized monthly surveys in 12 malarious study villages, from 1982
   through 1988. Anopheles culicifacies contributed the highest number of
   smears from the 19 Anopheles species recovered. It was observed that a
   pronounced predilection to take mixed bloodmeals attenuates the vector
   potential of the species concerned. Consequently, prevalences based only
   upon ``pure{''} (unmixed) primate bloodmeals provide the most accurate
   way to assess the intensity of feeding contact that actually occurs
   between a given species and man. By this method, the ranking order is
   Anopheles fluviatilis, An. culicifacies and An. annularis (N); a
   sequence which concurs with current knowledge on the vector status of
   malaria mosquitoes in Orissa.}},

Abstract = {{Seven paracentric inversions, designed i1 to o1, on polytene chromosome
   arm 2 and one, r, on chromosome arm 3 were found in natural populations
   of the Anopheles culicifacies complex.  Of the polymorphic inversions on
   chromosome arm 2, one was found in species B, whereas all others were in
   species A and the r inversion on chromosome arm 3 was found in both the
   species.  One inversion on chromosome arm 2, the i1 inversion, was
   observed at low frequency in parts of northern India and as a cline of
   progressively higher frequencies towards central India.  In southern
   India, there was no specific pattern of i1 distribution, with most
   localities showing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium frequencies.  Significant
   deficiencies of i1 heterozygotes in a few populations, mostly towards
   the northern end of the cline, indicate a second species within species
   A.  The same inversion may be floating in one species and fixed in the
   other; thus, the two species are homosequential for polytene chromosome
   arrangements.  These data support a recent report of species D within
   this group, but polytene chromosome arrangement cannot be used to
   identify species A and D at an individual level.}},

Abstract = {{The floating water fern Azolla microphylla Kaulfess was evaluated as a
   biocontrol agent against mosquitoes breeding in rice fields in Tamil
   Nadu, South India.  Anopheles subpictus Grassi, Culex pseudovishnui
   Colless and Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles were the predominant species
   of mosquitoes, with peak densities of late instar larvae and pupae
   occurring during the second week after transplantation of rice seedlings
   of short-term (c. 80 days from transplantation to harvest) or
   medium-term (c. 95 days) varieties.
   Immature mosquito populations were reduced by mats of Azolla microphylla
   covering more than 80\% of the water surface.  However, since 80\%
   coverage by Azolla was achieved only 13-14 days after rice
   transplantation, its usefulness for mosquito control was limited. 
   Azolla may have a greater potential in an integrated control programme,
   or in areas where long-term varieties of rice are predominantly grown.}},

Abstract = {{Studies conducted in Warangal, Khammam and Mahabubnagar districts in
   Andhra Pradesh and Surat district in Gujarat have revealed that
   Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato (s.l.) populations were resistant to
   malathion.  In the absence of indoor spraying of malathion in public
   health programs in the 3 districts of Andhra Pradesh, resistance is
   attributed to the extensive use of pesticides in agriculture.  Species B
   and C were sympatric in all areas surveyed, and both the species were
   resistant to malathion.  In most of the surveys carried out in
   Mahabubnagar, Khammam and Warangal, levels of resistance were higher in
   species C than in B.  In Mahabubnagar district an increase in resistance
   from 5.5 to 64\% was observed from 1985 to 1987 in An. culicifacies s.l.
   The proportion of species C was low in the initial 2 surveys, and in the
   later surveys the proportion was almost equal to that of species B; the
   resistance level was also significantly higher than in species B.  In
   Surat district, where resistance ranged from 74 to 93\%, the level of
   resistance in the 2 species was almost the same.}},
