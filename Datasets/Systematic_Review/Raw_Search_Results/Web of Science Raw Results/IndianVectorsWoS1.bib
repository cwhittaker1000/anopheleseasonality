Title = {{First record of Anopheles stephensi in Sri Lanka: a potential challenge
   for prevention of malaria reintroduction}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},

Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The major malaria vector in Sri Lanka is reported to be
   Anopheles culicifacies with Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles annularis,
   and Anopheles varuna considered as potential vectors. The occurrence of
   Anopheles stephensi, which is the key vector of urban malaria in India
   and the Middle East, had never been reported from Sri Lanka.
   Methods: A series of entomological investigations were carried out by
   the Anti Malaria Campaign, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka during December
   2016 to April 2017 in two localities of the Mannar District in the
   Northern Province of the country. Adult mosquito collections were done
   through indoor and outdoor resting collections, animal and human biting
   collections and emergence traps. Potential mosquito breeding sites were
   investigated through larval surveys. The larvae and adults of An.
   stephensi were initially identified using morphological keys, and
   subsequently confirmed by sequencing the barcode region of the
   cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene.
   Results: This is the first report of the presence of An. stephensi in
   the island of Mannar in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Anopheles
   stephensi (36.65\%) was the most abundant anopheline species in the
   larval habitats in Mannar. It was found breeding together with An.
   culicifacies (20.7\%), An. subpictus (13.5\%) and An. varuna (28.13\%).
   Anopheles stephensi was found to be abundantly breeding in built wells
   used for domestic purposes. Adult females of An. stephensi were observed
   in emergence trap collections (93.9\%), human landing catches all night
   (79.2\%), pyrethrum spray sheet collections (38.6\%), outdoor
   collections (8.3\%), donkey-baited trap collections (14.3), and
   cattle-baited net trap collections (0.7\%).
   Conclusions: Sri Lanka was certified as malaria-free by the WHO in
   September 2016, however, this new finding may pose a serious challenge
   to the efforts of the Ministry of Health to prevent the re-introduction
   of malaria transmission in the country, considering the role that An.
   stephensi could play in urban and high vulnerability areas of Sri Lanka.}},

Title = {{Additional burden of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria infections
   during low transmission season in forested tribal villages in
   Chhattisgarh, India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The burden of sub-patent malaria is difficult to recognize
   in low endemic areas due to limitation of diagnostic tools, and
   techniques. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular based
   technique, is one of the key methods for detection of low parasite
   density infections. The study objective was to assess the additional
   burden of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria infection among tribal
   populations inhabiting three endemic villages in Keshkal sub-district,
   Chhattisgarh, India. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in
   March-June 2016, during the low transmission season, to measure and
   compare prevalence of malaria infection using three diagnostics: rapid
   diagnostic test, microscopy and nested-PCR.
   Results: Out of 437 individuals enrolled in the study, 103 (23.6\%) were
   malaria positive by PCR and/or microscopy of whom 89.3\% were Plasmodium
   falciparum cases, 77.7\% were afebrile and 35.9\% had sub-patent
   infections.
   Conclusions: A substantial number of asymptomatic and sub-patent malaria
   infections were identified in the survey. Hence, strategies for
   identifying and reducing the hidden burden of asymptomatic and
   sub-patent infections should focus on forest rural tribal areas using
   more sensitive molecular diagnostic methods to curtail malaria
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is one of the most debilitating mosquito-borne diseases with
   high global health burdens. While much of the research on malaria and
   mosquito-borne diseases is focused on Africa, Southeast Asia accounts
   for a sizable portion of the global burden of malaria. Moreover, about
   50\% of the Asian malaria incidence and deaths have been from India. A
   promising development in this context is that the completion of genome
   sequence of Anopheles stephensi, a major malaria vector in Asia, offers
   new opportunities for global health innovation, including the progress
   in deciphering the vectorial ability of this mosquito species at a
   molecular level. Moving forward, tissue-based expression profiling would
   be the next obvious step in understanding gene functions of An.
   stephensi. We report in this article, to the best of our knowledge, the
   first in-depth study on tissue-based transcriptomic profile of four
   important organs (midgut, Malpighian tubules, fat body, and ovary) of
   adult female An. stephensi mosquitoes. In all, we identified over 20,000
   transcripts corresponding to more than 12,000 gene loci from these four
   tissues. We present and discuss the tissue-based expression profiles of
   majority of annotated transcripts in An. stephensi genome, and the
   dynamics of their alternative splicing in these tissues, in this study.
   The domain-based Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed
   transcripts in each of the mosquito tissue indicated enrichment of
   transcripts with proteolytic activity in midgut; transporter activity in
   Malpighian tubules; cell cycle, DNA replication, and repair activities
   in ovaries; and oxidoreductase activities in fat body. Tissue-based
   study of transcript expression and gene functions markedly enhances our
   understanding of this important malaria vector, and in turn, offers
   rationales for further studies on vectorial ability and identification
   of novel molecular targets to intercept malaria transmission.}},

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: In global efforts to track mosquito infectivity and parasite
   elimination, controlled mosquito-feeding experiments can help in
   understanding the dynamics of parasite development in vectors. Anopheles
   stephensi is often accepted as the major urban malaria vector that
   transmits Plasmodium in Goa and elsewhere in South Asia. However, much
   needs to be learned about the interactions of Plasmodium vivax with An.
   stephensi. As a component of the US NIH International Center of
   Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) for Malaria Evolution in South
   Asia (MESA), a series of membrane-feeding experiments with wild An.
   stephensi and P. vivax were carried out to better understand this
   vector-parasite interaction.
   Methods: Wild An. stephensi larvae and pupae were collected from curing
   water in construction sites in the city of Ponda, Goa, India. The larvae
   and pupae were reared at the MESA ICEMR insectary within the National
   Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) field unit in Goa until they
   emerged into adult mosquitoes. Blood for membrane-feeding experiments
   was obtained from malaria patients at the local Goa Medical College and
   Hospital who volunteered for the study. Parasites were counted by Miller
   reticule technique and correlation between gametocytaemia/parasitaemia
   and successful mosquito infection was studied.
   Results: A weak but significant correlation was found between patient
   blood gametocytaemia/parasitaemia and mosquito oocyst load. No
   correlation was observed between gametocytaemia/parasitaemia and oocyst
   infection rates, and between gametocyte sex ratio and oocyst load. When
   it came to development of the parasite in the mosquito, a strong
   positive correlation was observed between oocyst midgut levels and
   sporozoite infection rates, and between oocyst levels and salivary gland
   sporozoite loads. Kinetic studies showed that sporozoites appeared in
   the salivary gland as early as day 7, post-infection.
   Conclusions: This is the first study in India to carry out
   membrane-feeding experiments with wild An. stephensi and P. vivax. A
   wide range of mosquito infection loads and infection rates were
   observed, pointing to a strong interplay between parasite, vector and
   human factors. Most of the present observations are in agreement with
   feeding experiments conducted with P. vivax elsewhere in the world.}},

Abstract = {{The southern districts of Odisha State in east-central India have been
   highly endemic for falciparum malaria for many decades. However, there
   is no adequate information on the abundance of the vector species or
   their bionomics in relation to space and time in these districts.
   Therefore, a study was carried out on the entomological aspects of
   malaria transmission to generate such information. Collections of
   mosquitoes were made once during each of the three seasons in 128
   villages selected from eight districts. Villages within the foot-hill
   ecotype had a significantly greater abundance of Anopheles fluviatilis
   James s. l., whereas the abundance of Anopheles culicifacies Giles s. l.
   was significantly greater in the plain ecotype. The abundance of An.
   fluviatilis was maximum during the cold season, whereas An. culicifacies
   abundance was highest during summer and rainy seasons. The maximum
   likelihood estimation of the malaria infection rate in An. fluviatilis
   was 1.78\%, 6.05\%, and 2.6\% in Ganjam, Kalahandi, and Rayagada
   districts, respectively. The infection rate of An. culicifacies was
   1.39\% only in Kandhamal district; infected females were not detected
   elsewhere. Concurrently, the annual malaria parasite incidence (MPI) was
   significantly higher in hill-top (17.6) and foot-hill (14.4) villages
   compared to plain villages (4.1). The districts with more villages in
   hill-top and foot-hill ecotypes also had a greater abundance of An.
   fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, and exhibited a higher incidence
   of malaria than villages within the plain ecotype, where An.
   culicifacies was the most abundant vector.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) being an eco-friendly bioinsecticide is
   effectively used in pest management strategies and, therefore, isolation
   and identification of new strains effective against a broad range of
   target pests is important. In the present study, new indigenous B.
   thuringiensis strains were isolated and investigated so that these could
   be used as an alternative and/ or support the current commercial
   strains/cry proteins in use. For this, 159 samples including soil, leaf
   and spider webs were collected from ten districts of Kashmir valley
   (India). Of 1447 bacterial strains screened, 68 Bt strains were
   identified with 4 types of crystalline inclusions. Crystal morphology
   ranking among the Bt strains was spherical (69.11\%){[}spore attached
   (8.82\%){[}rod (5.88\%) = bipyramidal (5.88\%){[} spherical plus rod
   (4.41\%){[}spherical plus bipyramidal (2.94\%) = cuboidal (2.94\%).
   SDS-PAGE investigation of the spore-crystal mixture demonstrated Bt
   strains contained proteins of various molecular weights ranging from 150
   to 28 kDa. Insecticidal activity of the 68 indigenous Bt strains against
   Spodoptera litura neonates showed that Bt strain SWK1 strain had the
   highest mortality. Lepidopteron active genes (cry1, cry2Ab, cry2Ab) were
   present in six Bt strains. Further, analysis of a full-length cry2A gene
   (similar to 1.9 kb) by PCR-RFLP in strain SWK1 revealed that it was a

Abstract = {{The Indian vector control programme similar to other programmes in the
   world is still reliant on chemical insecticides. Anopheles culicifacies
   is the major vector out of six primary malaria vectors in India and
   alone contributes about 2/3 malaria cases annually; and per se its
   control is actually control of malaria in India. For effective
   management of vectors, current information on their susceptibility
   status to different insecticides is essential. In this review, an
   attempt was made to compile and present the available data on the
   susceptibility status of different malaria vector species in India from
   the last 2.5 decades. Literature search was conducted by different means
   mainly web and library search; susceptibility data was collated from 62
   sources for the nine malaria vector species from 145 districts in 21
   states and two union territories between 1991 and 2016. Interpretation
   of the susceptibility/resistance status was made on basis of the recent
   WHO criteria. Comprehensive analysis of the data indicated that An.
   culicifacies, a major vector species was resistant to at least one
   insecticide in 70\% (101/145) of the districts. It was reported mostly
   resistant to DDT and malathion whereas, its resistant status against
   deltamethrin varied across the districts. The major threat for the
   malaria control programmes is multiple-insecticide-resistance in An.
   culicifacies which needs immediate attention for resistance management
   in order to sustain the gains achieved so far, as the programmes have
   targeted malaria elimination by 2030.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Anopheles stephensi is one of the most
   important urban malaria vectors in India and contribute about 12\% of
   total malaria cases. An. stephensi has three ecological variants; type,
   intermediate and mysorensis that can be differentiated on the basis of
   differences in number of ridges on egg float and on the basis of
   spiracular indices. Because of its anthropophilic nature the `type' form
   is an efficient malaria vector. In the present study, the egg surface
   morphometry and morphology of An. stephensi `type' form was studied and
   detail distinguishing characters were recorded for its correct
   identification.
   Methods: Eggs of An. stephensi `type' form were studied by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) after sputter-coating with gold. In total 23
   egg characters were analysed morphologically and morphometrically, which
   included egg attributes, deck attributes, ventral tubercles, micropyle
   and float attributes.
   Results: The dorsal surface of the egg of `type' form was curved while
   the ventral surface was concave and both anterior and posterior ends
   were blunt. The average length and width of egg was 473.94 +/- 11.18 and
   154.69 +/- 2.66 mu m respectively. The number of float ribs observed was
   20.33 +/- 0.33. The maximum length of float was found to be 246.57 +/-
   15.27 mu m, whereas maximum width was 87.16 +/- 3.83 mu m.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The present study has generated some
   important data which is specific to An. stephensi `type' form and
   provided significant morphological and morphometric standards for its
   correct identification. This information could be useful in
   differentiation of An. stephensi `type' form from other ecological forms
   of the same species as well as other species of Anopheles.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes belonging to Aedes genus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
   transmit many globally important arboviruses including Dengue (DENY) and
   Chikungunya (CHIKV). Vector control with the use of insecticide remains
   the suitable method of choice to stop the transmission of these
   diseases. However, vector control throughout the world is failing to
   achieve its target results because of the worldwide development of
   insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. To assess the insecticide
   susceptibility status of Aedes albopictus from northern part of West
   Bengal, the susceptibility of eight different Aedes albopictus
   populations were tested against a commonly used larvicide (temephos) and
   some adulticides (malathion, deltamethrin and lambda cyhalothrin) along
   with the major insecticide detoxifying enzymes' activity in them.
   Through this study, it was revealed that most of the populations were
   found susceptible to temephos except Nagrakata (NGK) and Siliguri (SLG),
   which showed both a higher resistance ratio (RR99) and a lower
   susceptibility, thereby reflecting the development of resistance against
   temephos in them. However, all tested adulticides caused 100\% mortality
   in all the population implying their potency in control of this mosquito
   in this region of India. Through the study of carboxylesterase activity,
   it was revealed that the NGK population showed a 9.6 fold higher level
   of activity than susceptible population. The same population also showed
   a lower level of susceptibility and a higher resistance ratio (RR99),
   indicating a clear correlation between susceptibility to temephos and
   carboxylesterase enzymes' activity in this population. This preliminary
   data reflects that the NGK population is showing a trend towards
   resistance development and with time, there is possibility that this
   resistance phenomenon will spread to other populations. With the
   recurrence of dengue and chikungunya, this data on insecticide
   susceptibility status of Aedes albopictus could help the authorities
   engaged in vector control programmes to formulate effective measures
   against this mosquito in this region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dengue and chikungunya are arboviral diseases mainly vectored by the
   mosquito Aedes aegypti. Presently, there is no treatment for these viral
   diseases and their prevention is still based on vector control measures.
   Nanopesticides fabricated using herbal extracts as reducing and capping
   agents currently represent an excellent platform for pest control. In
   this scenario, the present study assessed the acute toxicity of seven
   plants employed in ethno-veterinary medicine of southern India, as well
   as the green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles, on third-instar
   larvae of A. aegypti. Larvae were exposed to extracts of the seven
   plants obtained with solvents of different polarity (acetone, ethanol,
   petroleum ether, and water) for 24 h. Maximum efficacy was observed for
   Lobelia leschenaultiana leaf extracts prepared using all the four
   solvent extracts (LC50 = 22.83, 28.12, 32.61, and 36.85 mg/L,
   respectively). Therefore, this plant species was used for the synthesis
   and stabilization of ZnO nanoparticles based on its maximum efficacy
   against third-instar larvae of A. aegypti. L.
   leschenaultiana-encapsulated ZnO nanoparticles showed 100\% mortality
   when tested at 10 mg/L, the LC50 was extremely low, 1.57 mg/L. Zinc
   acetate achieved only 65.33\% when tested at 60 mg/L, with a LC50 of
   51.62 mg/L. Additionally, ZnO nanoparticles inhibited growth of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus and also inhibited biofilm formation on selected
   microbila pathogens, showing impact on EPS production and
   hydrophobicity. Overall, our results suggest that L.
   leschenaultiana-fabricated ZnO nanoparticles have a significant
   potential to control A. aegypti mosquitoes and Gram-negative bacterial
   pathogens.}},

Title = {{Malaria epidemiology in an area of stable transmission in tribal
   population of Jharkhand, India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria remains an important health problem in India with
   approximately 1 million cases in 2014. Of these, 7\% occurred in the
   Jharkhand state mainly in the tribal population.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Dumargarhi, a tribal village about
   42 km east of Ranchi city, Jharkhand, from May 2014 to September 2016.
   Four point prevalence surveys were carried out during consecutive high
   (October-December) and low (June-August) transmission seasons. Malaria
   cases were recorded from April 2015 to April 2016 through fortnightly
   visits to the village. Adult mosquito densities were monitored
   fortnightly by manual catching using suction tube method.
   Results: The study area consists of five hamlets inhabited by 945
   individuals living in 164 households as recorded through a
   house-to-house census survey performed at enrollment. The study
   population consisted predominantly of the Munda (n = 425, 45\%) and
   Oraon (n = 217, 23\%) ethnic groups. Study participants were categorized
   as per their age 0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and > 15 years. There were 99 cases of
   clinical malaria from April 2015 to April 2016 and all malaria cases
   confirmed by microscopy were attributed to Plasmodium falciparum (94
   cases) and Plasmodium vivax (5 cases), respectively. During the high
   transmission season the mean density of P. falciparum parasitaemia per
   age group increased to a peak level of 23,601 parasites/mu l in the 6-10
   years age group and gradually declined in the adult population. Malaria
   attack rates, parasite prevalence and density levels in the study
   population showed a gradual decrease with increasing age. This finding
   is consistent with the phenomenon of naturally acquired immunity against
   malaria. Three vector species were detected: Anopheles fluviatilis,
   Anopheles annularis, and Anopheles culicifacies. The incoherence or
   complete out of phase pattern of the vector density peaks together with
   a high prevalence of parasite positive individuals in the study
   population explains the year-round malaria transmission in the study
   region.
   Conclusions: The collection of clinical data from a well-characterized
   tribal cohort from Jharkhand, India, has provided evidence for naturally
   acquired immunity against malaria in this hyperendemic region. The study
   also suggests that enforcement of existing control programmes can reduce
   the malaria burden further.}},

   Plasmodium. Anopheles aquasalis has natural exophilic and zoophilic
   feeding behavior, but in cases of high density and absence of animals,
   presents quite varied behavior, and feeds on human blood. In this
   context, the objective of the present study was to identify Plasmodium
   spp. and the blood meal sources of anophelines in two environmental
   reserves on Sao Luis Island, state of Maranhao, using molecular methods.
   Methods: Between June and July 2013, female anophelines were collected
   in the Sitio Aguahy Private Reserve, in the municipality of Sao Josee de
   Ribamar, and in the Sitio Mangalho Reserve, located within the Maracana
   Environmental Protection Area, in the municipality of Sao Luis. CDC-type
   light traps, Shannon traps and protected human bait were used during
   three consecutive hours in peridomesticand wooded areas. Pools of
   anophelines were formed using mosquitoes of the same species that had
   been caught at the same site on the same date. A genus-specific
   amplification protocol based on the 18S rRNA gene was used for qPCR and
   cPCR.
   Results: A total of 416 anophelines were collected, of the following
   species: An. aquasalis (399), An. mediopunctatus (3), An. shannoni (1),
   An. nuneztovari (sensu lato) (1), An. goeldii (1), An. evansae (2) and
   An. (Nyssorhynchus) sp. (9), comprising 54 pools. Two pools were
   positive for Plasmodium (2/ 54) based on the 18S rRNA gene. In the
   phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method, based on a
   240 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, it was found that the sequences of
   Plasmodium sp. amplified from pools of An. aquasalis (pool 2) and An.
   nuneztovari (s.l.) (pool 10) were phylogenetically related to a clade of
   P. falciparum isolates from India, and to a clade of Plasmodium sp.
   isolates from psittacines in Brazil, respectively. Cat, dog and human
   DNA were identified in the blood meals of the anophelines sampled.
   Conclusion: The species An. aquasalis was the most abundant anopheline
   species in Sao Luis Island. Plasmodium spp. DNA was detected, thus
   confirming the importance of this species as the main vector on Sao Luis
   Island, Brazil. In addition, the presence of An. nuneztovari (s.l.) with
   DNA positive for Plasmodium spp. confirms its importance as a secondary
   vector.}},

Abstract = {{During the present study, the host-parasite relationship between
   mosquitoes and parasitic mites was investigated. The 8954 individuals of
   male and female mosquitoes belonging to 26 genera: seven each of Aedes
   and Culex, six of Anopheles and one each of Toxorhynchites,
   Coquillettidia and Uranotaenia were collected from 200 sites. The male
   and female mosquitoes were collected from the State of Uttar Pradesh,
   located at 26.8500 degrees N, 80.9100 degrees E in North India by
   deploying Carbon dioxide-baited and gravid traps. The intensity of
   mite's infection, type and number of mites attached to mosquitoes,
   mite's preference for body parts and host sexes were the parameters used
   to determine host-parasite relationship. Eight species of mites:
   Arrenurus acuminatus, Ar. gibberifrons, Ar. danbyensis, Ar. madaraszi,
   Ar. kenki, Parathyas barbigera, Leptus sp., and Anystis sp., parasitized
   mosquitoes. Parasitic mites preferred host's thorax for attachment as
   compared to the head, pre-abdomen or appendages. The present study
   suggests phoretic relationship between parasitic mites and mosquitoes.
   Wide occurrence, intensity of infection, parasitic load, and attachment
   preferences of the mites suggested their positive role in biological
   control of adult mosquitoes. The present study will set the path of
   future studies on host-parasite relationships of mites and mosquitoes
   and define the role of parasitic mites in the biological control of
   mosquitoes. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia. Published by

Title = {{Knockdown resistance mutations predict DDT resistance and pyrethroid
   tolerance in the visceral leishmaniasis vector Phlebotomus argentipes}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with DDT has been the primary strategy
   for control of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) vector Phlebotomus
   argentipes in India but efficacy may be compromised by resistance.
   Synthetic pyrethroids are now being introduced for IRS, but with a
   shared target site, the para voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC),
   mutations affecting both insecticide classes could provide
   cross-resistance and represent a threat to sustainable IRS-based disease
   control.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A region of the Vgsc gene was sequenced in P. argentipes from the VL
   hotspot of Bihar, India. Two knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations were
   detected at codon 1014 (L1014F and L1014S), each common in mosquitoes,
   but previously unknown in phlebotomines. Both kdr mutations appear
   largely recessive, but as homozygotes (especially 1014F/F) or as 1014F/S
   heterozygotes exert a strong effect on DDT resistance, and significantly
   predict survivorship to class II pyrethroids in short-duration
   bioassays. The mutations are present at high frequency in wild P.
   argentipes populations from Bihar, with 1014F significantly more common
   in higher VL areas.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The Vgsc mutations detected appear to be a primary mechanism underlying
   DDT resistance in P. argentipes and a contributory factor in reduced
   pyrethroid susceptibility, suggesting a potential impact if P.
   argentipes are subjected to suboptimal levels of pyrethroid exposure, or
   additional resistance mechanisms evolve. The assays to detect kdr
   frequency changes provide a sensitive, high-throughput monitoring tool
   to detecting spatial and temporal variation in resistance in P.
   argentipes.}},

Abstract = {{Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia limori, categorized as

   worms dwell in the subcutaneous tissues and lymphatics of human hosts.
   In India, W bancrofti is the primary nematode to cause filariasis, which
   is transmitted through the bite of blood-sucking infected female
   anopheles mosquitoes. Lymphangitis, leading to elephantiasis of the
   legs, arms, scrotum, and breast, is the most salient clinical feature of
   lymphatic filariasis. The presence of filarial worms in the oral and
   perioral soft tissues is uncommon; moreover, the presence of filarial
   worms in a centrally occurring bony lesion is highly unusual and has not

Abstract = {{Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae), an urban malaria vector

   effective in reducing mosquito populations and disease transmission by
   reducing its reproductive fitness. In this study, sublethal effects of
   alphamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, were assessed on selected fitness
   parameters. Late third instars of the Goraguntepalya strain, Bangalore,
   were exposed to three sublethal doses, LC10 - 0.00006, LC30 - 0.0004,
   and LC50 - 0.0014 mg/L and their effects on fecundity, egg hatchability,
   sex ratio, and longevity in parental, F-1 and F-2 generations. The
   morphology of gonads, pattern of pupation, and adult emergence were also
   assessed. We found a significant reduction in fecundity and hatchability
   among the sublethal concentrations as well as across generations.
   Survival analysis showed significant reduction in lifespan of exposed
   groups. Delay in pupation, eclosion, and no distortion in sex ratio was
   observed. The results suggest that sublethal concentrations of
   alphamethrin may have negative effects on exposed individuals and
   subsequent generations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Subclinical (asymptomatic) cases of malaria could be a major
   barrier to the success of malaria elimination programs. This study has
   evaluated the impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) on the
   prevalence of subclinical malaria in the presence of pyrethroid
   resistance in the main malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies on malaria
   transmission among a cohort of children in villages of the Keshkal
   sub-district in Chhattisgarh state.
   Methods: A cohort of 6582 children ages less than 14 years was enrolled
   from 80 study clusters. Post monsoon survey was carried out at baseline
   before LLIN distribution, and 5862 children were followed up in the
   subsequent year. Study outcomes included assessment of subclinical
   malarial infections and use of LLINs among the study cohort in the
   presence of varied levels of pyrethroid resistance.
   Findings: In the baseline survey, the proportion of subclinical malaria
   was 6.1\%. LLIN use during the previous night was 94.8\%. Overall,
   prevalence of subclinical malaria was significantly reduced to 1\% (p <
   0.001) in the second survey. LLIN users were protected from malaria (OR:
   0.25, 95\% CI = 0.12-0.52, p < 0.001) and subclinical malaria (OR: 0.25,
   95\% CI = 0.11-0.58, p = 0.001) despite the presence of pyrethroid
   resistance in the study area.
   Interpretation: In this low transmission area, sleeping under LLINs
   significantly reduced the burden of malaria among children. In the
   presence of pyrethroid resistant malaria vector, a high LLIN use of
   94.5\% was observed to have significantly brought down the proportion of
   subclinical malaria among the cohort children. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Title = {{Mapping the spatial distribution of the Japanese encephalitis vector,
   Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901 (Diptera: Culicidae) within areas of
   Japanese encephalitis risk}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the most significant
   aetiological agents of viral encephalitis in Asia. This medically
   important arbovirus is primarily spread from vertebrate hosts to humans
   by the mosquito vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Knowledge of the
   contemporary distribution of this vector species is lacking, and efforts
   to define areas of disease risk greatly depend on a thorough
   understanding of the variation in this mosquito's geographical
   distribution.
   Results: We assembled a contemporary database of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus
   presence records within Japanese encephalitis risk areas from formal
   literature and other relevant resources, resulting in 1,045
   geo-referenced, spatially and temporally unique presence records
   spanning from 1928 to 2014 (71.9\% of records obtained between 2001 and
   2014). These presence data were combined with a background dataset
   capturing sample bias in our presence dataset, along with environmental
   and socio-economic covariates, to inform a boosted regression tree model
   predicting environmental suitability for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus at each 5
   x 5 km gridded cell within areas of JE risk. The resulting fine-scale
   map highlights areas of high environmental suitability for this species
   across India, Nepal and China that coincide with areas of high JE
   incidence, emphasising the role of this vector in disease transmission
   and the utility of the map generated.
   Conclusions: Our map contributes towards efforts determining the spatial
   heterogeneity in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus distribution within the limits of
   JE transmission. Specifically, this map can be used to inform vector
   control programs and can be used to identify key areas where the
   prevention of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus establishment should be a priority.}},

Title = {{Resting and feeding preferences of Anopheles stephensi in an urban
   setting, perennial for malaria}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Indian city of Chennai is endemic for malaria and the
   known local malaria vector is Anopheles stephensi. Plasmodium vivax is
   the predominant malaria parasite species, though Plasmodium falciparum
   is present at low levels. The urban ecotype of malaria prevails in
   Chennai with perennial transmission despite vector surveillance by the
   Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS) of the National Vector Borne Disease Control
   Programme (NVBDCP). Understanding the feeding and resting preferences,
   together with the transmission potential of adult vectors in the area is
   essential in effective planning and execution of improved vector control
   measures.
   Methods: A yearlong survey was carried out in cattle sheds and human
   dwellings to check the resting, feeding preferences and transmission
   potential of An. stephensi. The gonotrophic status, age structure,
   resting and host seeking preferences were studied. The infection rate in
   An. stephensi and Anopheles subpictus were analysed by circumsporozoite
   ELISA (CS-ELISA).
   Results: Adult vectors were found more frequently and at higher
   densities in cattle sheds than human dwellings. The overall Human Blood
   Index (HBI) was 0.009 indicating the vectors to be strongly zoophilic.
   Among the vectors collected from human dwellings, 94.2\% were from
   thatched structures and the remaining 5.8\% from tiled and asbestos
   structures. 57.75\% of the dissected vectors were nulliparous whereas,
   35.83\% were monoparous and the rest 6.42\% biparous. Sporozoite
   positivity rate was 0.55\% (4/720) and 1.92\% (1/52) for An. stephensi
   collected from cattle sheds and human dwellings, respectively. One adult
   An. subpictus (1/155) was also found to be infected with P. falciparum.
   Conclusions: Control of the adult vector populations can be successful
   only by understanding the resting and feeding preferences. The present
   study indicates that adult vectors predominantly feed on cattle and
   cattle sheds are the preferred resting place, possibly due to easy
   availability of blood meal source and lack of any insecticide or
   repellent pressure. Hence targeting these resting sites with cost
   effective, socially acceptable intervention tools, together with
   effective larval source management to reduce vector breeding, could
   provide an improved integrated vector management strategy to help drive
   down malaria transmission and assist in India's plan to eliminate
   malaria by 2030.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Orang Primary Health Centre (OPHC) and Balipara Primary
   Health Centre (BPHC) of Assam (India) report mosquito borne diseases
   annually. Current study was performed to ascertain the prevalence of
   known malaria and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vectors and their possible
   role in disease transmission.
   Methods: Malaria epidemiological data for 2006-2010 and JE data for
   2008-2013 of Assam, India were obtained from the health authority.
   Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps and identified
   morpho-taxonomically.
   Results: Plasmodium falciparum cases (81.5\%, 95\% CI = 72.0-91.1) were
   statistically higher in OPHC (P < 0.0001, t = 8.0) during the recent
   years. There was 4.4 folds rise in the confirmed acute encephalitis
   syndrome (AES) and 3.2 folds increase in the confirmed JE cases during
   2013 as compared to 2008. Altogether 9,218 mosquito specimens (PTND =
   153.6), comprising of 44.1\% anophelines (PTND = 67.7), 42.3\% culicines
   (PTND = 65.0) and 9.5\% mansonia (PTND = 14.6) were recorded. In BPHC,
   Anopheles vagus was recorded in high density (P < 0.0001), whereas Culex
   quinquefasciatus was the predominant JE vector (P = 0.04). In OPHC,
   among the known malaria vectors, the density of Anopheles annularis was
   significantly high (P < 0.0001). However Culex bitaeniorhynchus was the
   predominant known JE vector (P< 0.0001) followed by Cx.
   quinquefasciatus.
   Conclusion: Even in the absence of known efficient vectors, many
   Anopheles species are still involved in malaria transmission. There was
   disappearance of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus and establishment
   of An. annularis, An. vagus and An. philippinensis/nivipes mosquitoes in
   study area.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Knowledge on prevalence of malaria vector
   species of a certain area provides important information for
   implementation of appropriate control strategies. The present study
   describes a rapid method for screening of major Anopheline vector
   species and at the same time detection of Plasmodium falciparum
   sporozoite infection and blood meal preferences/trophic preferences.
   Methods: The study was carried from February 2012 to March 2013 in three
   seasons, i.e. rainy, winter and summer in Jhumpura PHC of Keonjhar
   district, Odisha, India. Processing of mosquitoes was carried out in two
   different methods, viz. mosquito pool (P1) and mosquito DNA pool (P2).
   Pool size for both the methods was standardized for DNA isolation and
   multiplex PCR assay. This PCR based assay was employed to screen the
   major vector composition in three different seasons of four different
   ecotypes of Keonjhar district. Pearson's correlation coefficient was
   determined for a comparative analysis of the morphological
   identification with the pool prevalence assay for each ecotype.
   Results: A pool size of 10 was standardized for DNA isolation as well as
   PCR. PCR assay revealed that the average pool prevalence for all
   ecotypes was highest for An. annularis in winter and summer whereas for
   An. culicifacies it was rainy season. Foothill and plain ecotypes
   contributed to highest and lowest vectorial abundance respectively. The
   results of the prevalence of vector species in pool from PCR based assay
   were found to be highly correlated with that of the results of
   morphological identification.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Screening by pool based PCR assay is
   relatively rapid as compared to conventional morphological
   identification and can be employed as an important tool in malaria
   control programmes.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND New brands of potential long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs)
   and LLIN treatment kits require field evaluation before they are used in
   a vector control programme.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the bio-efficacy,
   usage, washing practice and physical integrity of nets treated with LLIN
   treatment kit, ICON MAXX in a phase III field trial in Odisha state,
   India.
   METHODS A total of 300 polyester nets treated with ICON MAXX and 140
   polyester nets treated conventionally with lambdacyhalothrin CS 2.5\%
   ITNs were distributed. The bio-efficacy was evaluated with WHO cone
   bioassay. The chemical analysis of netting pieces was done at the
   beginning, after 12 and 36 months of the trial.
   FINDINGS After one year of distribution of nets, the bioassay showed
   100\% mortality on both ITNs and ICON MAXX treated nets. At 36 months,
   the overall pass rate was 58.8\% and the mean lambda-cyhalothrin content
   of LLINs was 34.5 mg ai/m(2), showing a loss of 44.4\% of the original
   concentration.
   CONCLUSION ICON MAXX treated LLIN was found to retain bio-efficacy
   causing 97\% knockdown of Anopheles stephensi up to 30 months and met
   the WHOPES criteria. However, the desired bio-efficacy was not sustained
   up to 36 months.}},

   (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results of laboratory bioassay revealed
   that prey consumption rate of predator species was positively related
   with increasing temperature and inversely related with increasing search
   area. Polynomial logistic regression equations and associated parameters
   showed that A. sardea exhibited a type II functional response in

Abstract = {{Malaria is one of the six major vector-borne diseases in India, the
   endemicity of which changes with changes in ecological, climatic, and
   sociodevelopmental conditions. The anopheline vectors are greatly
   affected by ecological conditions such as deforestation, urbanization,
   climate and lifestyle. Despite the advent of tools such as Geographic
   Information System (GIS), the updated information on the distribution of
   anopheline vectors of malaria is not available. In India, the plan for
   vector control is organized at subcentral level but information about
   vectors is unavailable even at the district level. Therefore, a
   systematic presentation of vector distribution has been made to provide
   maps in respect of major vector species. A search of the literature for
   major vector species, that is, Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles
   fluviatilis, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles minimus, and Anopheles dirus
   sensu lato, since 1927 till 2015 was carried out. Data have been
   presented as present, absent, and no information about vector species
   during pre-eradication (1927-1958), posteradication (1959-1999), and
   current scenario (2000-2015). Vectors' distribution and malaria
   endemicity were mapped using Arc GIS. Of 630 districts of India, major
   vectors An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, and An. stephensi were
   present in 420, 241, and 243 districts, respectively. In 183 districts,
   there is no information on any major malaria vector species although 27
   of them from the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, and
   Mizoram are highly endemic for malaria, having incidences of 2-40
   cases/1000/year. The identified gaps in vector distribution,
   particularly in malaria endemic areas, necessitate further surveys so as
   to generate the missing information.}},

   Water Development Projects (WDP) in relation to mosquito-borne diseases
   have been carried out in India. The current study focuses on using HIA
   as a tool for finding impact of Indira Sagar Project, Madhya Pradesh on
   human health in relation to mosquito borne diseases, and emphasizing its
   incorporation as an integral part of any WDP.
   Methods: Screening, scoping, assessment, recommendation, reporting, and
   evaluation were carried out in selected study areas. Entomological,
   epidemiological, socio-economic and knowledge, attitudes and practices
   data related to malaria transmission in three dam components:
   Submergence (SUB), Command (CMD) and Resettlement and Rehabilitation
   (RR) colonies were generated for the period of January 2013-December
   2014. Statistical analysis was attempted to compare data among dam
   components and to identify risk factors. Component-specific mitigation
   measures were suggested based on observations.
   Results: Anopheles culicifacies was the dominating species in all three
   dam components and its man-hour density in CMD areas was higher compared
   to SUB and RR. The odds of finding a positive malaria case was much
   higher in CMD compared to SUB (OR 1.24, CI 95\% 0.71-2.43) and RR (OR
   5.48, CI 95\% 0.73-40.63). Respondents of CMD stated more previous
   episodes of malaria (81.8\%) compared to RR (61.4\%) and SUB (55.7\%).
   The canonical discriminant analysis concluded that distance from
   reservoir/Indira Sagar canal had the highest discriminating ability of
   malaria cases in different components followed by treatment-seeking
   behaviour and malaria history. The analysis identified these risk
   factors with 70\% accuracy.
   Conclusion: Engineering manipulations may be carried out in CMD areas to
   control seepage and RR colonies should be established beyond 3 km from
   reservoir/Indira Sagar canal considering the flight range of A.
   culicifacies. Strengthening of surveillance with early detection and
   complete treatment was recommended for CMD areas. To avoid future
   transmission in other areas and projects HIA should be carried out at
   planning stage for planning better control activities.}},

Title = {{Increasing the potential for malaria elimination by targeting zoophilic

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Countries in the Asia Pacific region aim to eliminate malaria by 2030. A
   cornerstone of malaria elimination is the effective management of
   Anopheles mosquito vectors. Current control tools such as insecticide
   treated nets or indoor residual sprays target mosquitoes in human
   dwellings. We find in a high transmission region in India, malaria
   vector populations show a high propensity to feed on livestock (cattle)
   and rest in outdoor structures such as cattle shelters. We also find
   evidence for a shift in vector species complex towards increased
   zoophilic behavior in recent years. Using a malaria transmission model
   we demonstrate that in such regions dominated by zoophilic vectors,
   existing vector control tactics will be insufficient to achieve
   elimination, even if maximized. However, by increasing mortality in the
   zoophilic cycle, the elimination threshold can be reached. Current
   national vector control policy in India restricts use of residual
   insecticide sprays to domestic dwellings. Our study suggests substantial
   benefits of extending the approach to treatment of cattle sheds, or
   deploying other tactics that target zoophilic behavior. Optimizing use
   of existing tools will be essential to achieving the ambitious 2030
   elimination target.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine the resistance of PermaNet
   (R) 2.0 bed nets against repeated washing and environmental factors by
   using bioassay tests. After 5, 15 and 21 washings with detergents and by
   using bioassay tests, the resistance of 40 PermaNet (R) 2.0 bed nets was
   compared with that of 40 bed nets conventionally treated with one K-O
   tablet. To examine the long-term resistance, 31 PermaNet (R) 2.0 bed
   nets were also distributed among villagers, and were re-collected to
   perform bioassay tests after 1, 2 and 5 years. In the first phase of
   this study, the insecticidal effect of the conventionally-treated nets
   significantly decreased due to repeated washings (P < 0.001); however,
   it was not significant regarding PermaNet (R) 2.0 bed nets (P = 0.92 in
   continuous exposure and P = 0.12 in mortality tests). In the long-term
   phase of this study, the time required for knockdown of PermaNet (R) 2.0
   increased over the first 2 years and then decreased. In addition, the
   mortality rate decreased over the first 2 years and then increased. In
   conclusion, it seems that the technique used by the manufacturer for
   impregnation of PermaNet (R) 2.0 bed nets has an acceptable efficiency
   in comparison with conventional techniques.}},

Journal = {{PLoS One}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are among the most important vectors of
   arboviral diseases, worldwide. Recent studies indicate that diverse
   midgut microbiota of mosquitoes significantly affect development,
   digestion, metabolism, and immunity of their hosts. Midgut microbiota
   has also been suggested to modulate the competency of mosquitoes to
   transmit arboviruses, malaria parasites etc. Interestingly, the midgut
   microbial flora is dynamic and the diversity changes with the
   development of vectors, in addition to other factors such as species,
   sex, life-stage, feeding behavior and geographical origin. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the midgut bacterial diversity
   among larva, adult male, sugar fed female and blood fed female Ae.
   albopictus collected from Tezpur, Northeastern India. Based on colony
   morphological characteristics, we selected 113 cultivable bacterial
   isolates for 16S rRNA gene sequence based molecular identification. Of
   the 113 isolates, we could identify 35 bacterial species belonging to 18
   distinct genera under four major phyla, namely Proteobacteria,
   Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Phyla Proteobacteria and
   Firmicutes accounted for majority (80\%) of the species, while phylum
   Actinobacteria constituted 17\% of the species. Bacteroidetes was the
   least represented phylum, characterized by a single
   species-Chryseobacterium rhizoplanae, isolated from blood fed
   individuals. Dissection of midgut microbiota diversity at different
   developmental stages of Ae. albopictus will be helpful in better
   understanding mosquito-borne diseases, and for designing effective
   strategies to manage mosquito-borne diseases.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: The Ramgarh district of Jharkhand state, India
   is highly malarious owing to abundance of different malaria vector
   species, namely Anopheles culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An.
   annularis. In spite of high prevalence of malaria vectors in Ramgarh,
   their larval ecology and climatic conditions affecting malaria dynamics
   have never been studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
   identify the diversity of potential breeding habitats and breeding
   preferences of anopheline vectors in the Ramgarh district.
   Methods: Anopheles immature collection was carried out at potential
   aquatic habitats in Ramgarh and Gola sites using the standard dipper on
   fortnightly basis from August 2012 to July 2013. The immatures were
   reared till adult emergence and further identified using standard keys.
   Temperature of outdoor and water bodies was recorded through temperature
   data loggers, and rainfall through standard rain gauges installed at
   each site.
   Results: A total of 6495 immature specimens representing 17 Anopheles
   species including three malaria vectors, viz. An. culicifacies, An.
   fluviatilis and An. annularis were collected from 11 types of breeding
   habitats. The highly preferred breeding habitats of vector anophelines
   were river bed pools, rivulets, wells, ponds, river margins, ditches and
   irrigation channels. Larval abundance of vector species showed
   site-specific variation with temperature and rainfall patterns
   throughout the year. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index ranged from 0.19
   to 1.94 at Ramgarh site and 0.16 to 1.76 at Gola site.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The study revealed that malaria vector
   species have been adapted to breed in a wide range of water bodies. The
   regular monitoring of such specific vector breeding sites under changing
   ecological and environmental conditions will be useful in guiding larval
   control operations selectively for effective vector/malaria control.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The world is rapidly becoming urban with the global population living in
   cities projected to double by 2050. This increase in urbanization poses
   new challenges for the spread and control of communicable diseases such
   as malaria. In particular, urban environments create highly
   heterogeneous socio-economic and environmental conditions that can
   affect the transmission of vector-borne diseases dependent on human
   water storage and waste water management. Interestingly India, as
   opposed to Africa, harbors a mosquito vector, Anopheles stephensi, which
   thrives in the man-made environments of cities and acts as the vector
   for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, making the malaria
   problem a truly urban phenomenon. Here we address the role and
   determinants of within-city spatial heterogeneity in the incidence
   patterns of vivax malaria, and then draw comparisons with results for
   falciparum malaria.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Statistical analyses and a phenomenological transmission model are
   applied to an extensive spatio-temporal dataset on cases of Plasmodium
   vivax in the city of Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India) that spans 12 years
   monthly at the level of wards. A spatial pattern in malaria incidence is
   described that is largely stationary in time for this parasite. Malaria
   risk is then shown to be associated with socioeconomic indicators and
   environmental parameters, temperature and humidity. In a more dynamical
   perspective, an Inhomogeneous Markov Chain Model is used to predict
   vivax malaria risk. Models that account for climate factors,
   socioeconomic level and population size show the highest predictive
   skill. A comparison to the transmission dynamics of falciparum malaria
   reinforces the conclusion that the spatio-temporal patterns of risk are
   strongly driven by extrinsic factors.
   Conclusion/significance
   Climate forcing and socio-economic heterogeneity act synergistically at
   local scales on the population dynamics of urban malaria in this city.
   The stationarity of malaria risk patterns provides a basis for more
   targeted intervention, such as vector control, based on transmission
   `hotspots'. This is especially relevant for P. vivax, a more resilient
   parasite than P. falciparum, due to its ability to relapse and the
   operational shortcomings of delivering a ``radical cure{''}.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Among six dominant mosquito vector species involved in malaria
   transmission in India, Anopheles minimus is a major species in northeast
   India and held responsible for focal disease outbreaks characterized by
   high-rise of Plasmodium falciparum infections and attributable death
   cases. It has been now genetically characterized that among the
   three-member species of the Minimus Complex spread in Asia, An. minimus
   (former species A) is prevalent in India including northeastern states
   and east-central state of Odisha. It is recorded in all seasons and
   accounts for perennial transmission evidenced by records of sporozoite
   infections. This species is highly anthropophilic, and largely
   endophilic and endophagic, recorded breeding throughout the year in slow
   flowing seepage water streams. The populations of An. minimus in India
   are reported to be highly diverse indicating population expansion with
   obvious implications for judicious application of vector control
   interventions. Given the rapid ecological changes due to deforestation,
   population migration and expansion and developmental activities, there
   is scope for further research on the existence of potential additional
   sibling species within the An. minimus complex and bionomics studies on
   a large geographical scale for species sanitation. For control of vector
   populations, DDT continues to be applied on account of retaining
   susceptibility status even after decades of residual spraying. Anopheles
   minimus is a highly adaptive species and requires continuous and
   sustained efforts for its effective control to check transmission and
   spread of drug-resistant malaria. Anopheles minimus populations are
   reportedly diminishing in northeastern India whereas it has staged
   comeback in east-central State of Odisha after decades of disappearance
   with its eco-biological characteristics intact. It is the high time to
   siege the opportunity for strengthening interventions against this
   species for its population diminution to sub-optimal levels for reducing
   transmission in achieving malaria elimination by target date of 2030.}},

Title = {{Does fluoride influence oviposition of Anopheles stephensi in stored
   water habitats in an urban setting?}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The physico-chemical characteristics of lentic aquatic
   habitats greatly influence mosquito species in selecting suitable
   oviposition sites; immature development, pupation and adult emergence,
   therefore are considerations for their preferred ecological niche.
   Correlating water quality parameters with mosquito breeding, as well as
   immature vector density, are useful for vector control operations in
   identifying and targeting potential breeding habitats.
   Methods: A total of 40 known habitats of Anopheles stephensi, randomly
   selected based on a vector survey in parallel, were inspected for the
   physical and chemical nature of the aquatic environment. Water samples
   were collected four times during 2013, representing four seasons (i.e.,
   ten habitats per season). The physico-chemical variables and mosquito
   breeding were statistically analysed to find their correlation with
   immature density of An. stephensi and also co-inhabitation with other
   mosquito species.
   Results: Anopheles stephensi prefer water with low nitrite content and
   high phosphate content. Parameters such as total dissolved solids,
   electrical conductivity, total hardness, chloride, fluoride and sulfate
   had a positive correlation in habitats with any mosquito species
   breeding (p < 0.05) and also in habitats with An. stephensi alone
   breeding. Fluoride was observed to have a strong positive correlation
   with immature density of An. stephensi in both overhead tanks and wells.
   Conclusion: Knowledge of larval ecology of vector mosquitoes is a key
   factor in risk assessment and for implementing appropriate and
   sustainable vector control operations. The presence of fluoride in
   potential breeding habitats and a strong positive correlation with An.
   stephensi immature density is useful information, as fluoride can be
   considered an indicator/predictor of vector breeding. Effective larval
   source management can be focussed on specified habitats in vulnerable
   areas to reduce vector abundance and malaria transmission.}},

Title = {{The changing malaria landscape in Aseer region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia:
   2000-2015}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: In 2004, a revised action plan was developed, supported by
   the World Health Organization, to eliminate malaria from Saudi Arabia by
   preventing re-introduction of malaria into regions since declared
   malaria free, eliminating foci of transmission in the Mecca and Medina
   areas and a concerted effort of foci surveillance and control, to
   eliminate malaria from the regions of Jazan and Aseer. This paper
   provides the context, activities, progress, and possible contributions
   toward malaria elimination in the Aseer region since 2000, with a more
   detailed analysis of the spatial location of locally acquired case
   incidence since 2012.
   Methods: This is a descriptive study of all available Ministry of Health
   surveillance data and process reports since 2000, with higher spatial
   resolution analysis of data between 2012 and 2015.
   Results: In 2000, there were 511 cases of Plasmodium falciparum locally
   acquired infection. The following 4 years witnessed a dramatic decline
   in cases to only 18 locally acquired infections reported in 2005. A
   resurgence in local infections was reported in 2006 (93) and 2007 (165),
   thereafter (2008-2014) local cases continued to decline to fewer than 40
   per year across the region. However, in 2015, a small rise was noted
   (51). All locally acquired infections were P. falciparum. There has been
   a constant flow of imported infections into Aseer since 2000, mostly
   among immigrant labour from Pakistan, India, Sudan, and Yemen. Imported
   infections have included both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. The
   spatial extent of malaria appears to be changing, but there remain two
   intractable areas Sarat Abeda and Dhran Aljanub, where risks per
   reporting centre have changed little since 2001, remaining above 0.5 per
   10,000 population. Only seven villages contributed 55\% of all locally
   acquired infection since 2012.
   Discussion: Aseer has reached a state of very low incidence of locally
   acquired infections, despite a constant source of imported infections
   from outside the country. How many of the local infections are F2
   generations from imported infections or how many are a result of
   residual active transmission between asymptomatic carriers of infections
   transmitted by pockets of existing Anopheles arabiensis populations
   remains unknown. A more detailed investigation of the spatial and
   temporal patterns of infected hosts, parasites and vectors would help
   define whether this region has managed to effectively prevent local
   transmission of new infections.}},

Abstract = {{The malaria situation in India is complex as a result of diverse
   socio-environmental conditions. India contributes a substantial burden
   of malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa, with the third highest Plasmodium
   vivax prevalence in the world. Successful malaria control in India is
   likely to enhance malaria elimination efforts in the region. Despite
   modest gains, there are many challenges for malaria elimination in
   India, including: varied patterns of malaria transmission in different
   parts of the country demanding area-specific control measures; intense
   malaria transmission fuelled by favourable climatic and environment
   factors; varying degrees of insecticide resistance of vectors;
   antimalarial drug resistance; a weak surveillance system; and poor
   national coordination of state programmes. Prevention and protection
   against malaria are low as a result of a weak health-care system, as
   well as financial and socioeconomic constraints. Additionally, the open
   borders of India provide a potential route of entry for
   artesunate-resistant parasites from southeast Asia. This situation calls
   for urgent dialogue around tackling malaria across borders-between
   India's states and neighbouring countries-through sharing of information
   and coordinated control and preventive measures, if we are to achieve
   the aim of malaria elimination in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is one of the major
   vectors of dengue which is an emerging threat in Northeast part of
   India. The morphological characterisation of mosquitoes is time
   consuming and lacks accuracy for distinguishing closely related species.
   Hence, molecular methods of mosquito identification, genetic diversity
   and molecular phylogeny have gained increased importance. This study was
   aimed to identify and characterize the most abundant species of Aedes
   vectors collected from different breeding spots in Assam, Northeast
   India employing molecular as well as bioinformatics tools.
   Methods: Ae. albopictus species was genetically characterized with
   internal transcribed spacerl (ITS1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
   (COI) genes and sequence analysis was carried out following molecular
   methods like PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and multiple sequence
   analysis. Maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny was reconstructed to
   define the evolutionary relationship among studied isolates and isolates
   from other parts of Southeast Asia.
   Results: Molecular study revealed that all five subject specimens
   belonged to Ae. albopictus species as per both ITS1 and COI genes.
   Maximum likelihood tree based on ITS1 and COI genes showed that isolates
   were distinctly grouped into separate clusters. Almost similar pattern
   of amino acid frequencies in COI gene was found amongst the five studied
   isolates. However, amino acid frequency in ITS1 gene was found to be
   dissimilar, indicating polymorphisms in this gene, among the isolates.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: This is the first report among the
   Northeastern states of India describing the genetic make-up of Ae.
   albopictus species by virtue of highly conserved mitochondria' (mt) DNA
   and ribosomal (r) DNA gene sequences. This study also illustrates that
   the sequence diversity of these two genes in this mosquito species
   differs geographically which differentiate a population and brings
   unique identity.}},

   ecological changes and change in landuse pattern etc. The objective of
   present study was to explore the vectorial role of An. culicifacies in
   transmission of malaria in four malaria endemic states, viz. Assam,
   Meghalaya, Manipur and Sikkim of India.
   Methods: The seven surveys were conducted in 176 selected villages
   belonging to eight districts of the four states in both pre-monsoon
   (March April) and post-monsoon (September October) seasons from 2010 to
   2013. However, in 2011 surveys could not be carried out due to public
   inconvenience in pre-monsoon season. For vectorial role of all vector
   species collected, ELISA and PCR were assayed.
   Results: A total of 19,173 specimens belonging to 30 anopheline species
   were collected, out of which 4315 belonged to four established vector
   species. In total, 4183 specimens were processed through ELISA, out of
   which 236 specimens were found positive for circumsporozoite (CS)
   protein. Further, infectivity was confirmed by PCR in 35 samples, of
   which 12 samples were found positive for Plasmodium falciparum and three
   for P. vivax. Out of 12 Plasmodium falciparum positive samples, nine
   samples were positive for An. culicifacies, two for An. fluviatilis and
   one for An. minimus. While out of three Plasmodium vivax positive
   samples, two samples were positive for An. dirus and one sample was
   positive for An. culicifacies.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Anopheles culicifacies replaced the An.
   minimus, the vector of malaria in Northeastern states of India, as it
   was found to be highly infected with malaria parasite as compared to An.
   minimus by ELISA and PCR analysis, and thus playing a major role in
   malaria transmission in this region. The ecological changes like
   deforestation, development of irrigation channels and change in landuse
   pattern, have helped in evolution of An. culicifacies in the study area.
   Therefore, modified vector control strategies are required on urgent
   basis.}},

Abstract = {{Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected
   female aedine mosquitoes. Differences in the composition and structure
   of bacterial communities in the midguts of mosquitoes may affect the
   vector's ability to transmit the disease. To investigate and analyse the
   role of midgut bacterial communities in viral transmission, midgut
   bacteria from three species, namely Stegomyia aegypti (= Aedes aegypti),
   Fredwardsius vittatus (= Aedes vittatus) and Stegomyia albopicta (=
   Aedes albopictus) (all: Diptera: Culicidae), from dengue-endemic and
   non-endemic areas of Rajasthan, India were compared. Construction and
   analyses of six 16S rRNA gene libraries indicated that Serratia
   spp.-related phylotypes dominated all clone libraries of the three
   mosquito species from areas in which dengue is not endemic. In
   dengue-endemic areas, phylotypes related to Aeromonas, Enhydrobacter
   spp. and uncultivated bacterium dominated the clone libraries of S.
   aegypti, F. vittatus and S. albopicta, respectively. Diversity indices
   analysis and real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assays showed
   bacterial diversity and abundance in the midguts of S. aegypti to be
   higher than in the other two species. Significant differences observed
   among midgut bacterial communities of the three mosquito species from
   areas in which dengue is and is not endemic, respectively, may be
   related to the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes to carry dengue viruses
   and, hence, to the prevalence of disease in some areas.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is a global issue and India contributes substantially to global
   malaria incidence. Information related to malaria vectors is very
   limited in Aligarh. The environmental and climatological situations
   permit the continual breeding of vectors in permanent breeding sites.
   This study was designed with the aim to screen all the anophelines
   species and possible malaria vectors in three different localities of
   Aligarh. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from three different
   localities (Fort, Jalali and Tappal) during peak malaria transmission
   season (July to November) by using mouth aspirator and CDC light traps.
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done to detect Plasmodium
   falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210 and P. vivax-247 circumsporozoite
   proteins (CSP) from the collected female species. A total of 794 female
   anopheline mosquitoes belonging to 7 species were collected by different
   methods. Circumsporozoite protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
   performed with 780 anopheline mosquitoes out of which 13 mosquitoes were
   positive in CSP ELISA. Thus, the overall infection rate was 1.66\%
   (13/780). Four (0.51\%) mosquitoes belonging to three species were
   positive for P. falciparum, 7 (0.89\%) mosquitoes belonging to three
   species were positive for VK 210 and 2 (0.25\%) mosquitoes belonging to
   Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi species were positive for
   VK 247. No mixed infection was found in this study. According to
   species, the highest infection rate was observed in An. culicifacies
   (7/288, 2.43\%) followed by An. stephensi (2.40\%) and Anopheles
   annularis (1.98\%). An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were previously
   incriminated as malaria vectors in Aligarh. There was, however, no
   previous report in favor of infections in An. annularis in Aligarh. The
   on-going Malaria Control Program in India needs up to date information
   on malaria vectors. A major challenge is the lack of knowledge about
   vectors and their role in malaria transmission. Findings of this study
   suggested that in the absence of major malaria vectors there is a
   possibility that other Anopheles species may have been playing a role in
   malaria transmission in Aligarh. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDAnopheles stephensi is an important urban malaria vector in
   the Indian subcontinent. Extensive application of insecticides evokes
   microevolution, which results in resistance that can be traced back to
   their genotypes. In this study, resistant and susceptible strains of An.
   stephensi for alphamethrin were selected by selective inbreeding for 27
   and ten generations respectively. The biochemical basis of resistance in
   all the life stages was investigated. Quantitative assays were performed
   for proteins (total and soluble), esterases (, and acetylcholine) and
   phosphatases (acid and alkaline) by spectrophotometry, and qualitative
   assays for the enzymes by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
   RESULTSThe enzyme quantities significantly varied in all life stages of
   the resistant strain as compared with the susceptible ones. Qualitative
   studies showed seven isoforms for - and -esterases, three each for
   acetylcholinesterase and alkaline phosphatase and two for acid
   phosphatase. Exclusive bands were found in the resistant strain, such as
   -Est 1 and -Est 1 in eggs and larvae, -Est 3 in adult males, -Est 2 in
   adult females and AlkP 1, AlkP 2 and AlkP 3 in adult females, larvae and
   adult males respectively.
   CONCLUSIONVariations in the quantity and specific enzyme isoforms play a
   key role in the development of alphamethrin resistance in An. stephensi.

Title = {{An experimental hut evaluation of Olyset Plus, a long-lasting
   insecticidal net treated with a mixture of permethrin and piperonyl
   butoxide, against Anopheles fluviatilis in Odisha State, India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fast development of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors
   prompted the development of new vector control tools including
   combination of insecticides with different modes of action as part of
   resistance management strategies. Olyset Plus (R) is a new long-lasting
   insecticidal net, in which, permethrin and a synergist, piperonyl
   butoxide (PBO), are incorporated into filaments. Mixture nets such as
   this may have application against resistant mosquitoes, particularly
   those whose resistance is based on oxidative metabolism. There may also
   be enhanced activity against susceptible mosquitoes since mixed function
   oxidases are involved in a many metabolic activities including
   activation to form bioactive compounds.
   Methods: Bio-efficacy of Olyset Plus was evaluated against susceptible
   malaria vector, Anopheles fluviatilis in experimental huts. Deterrence,
   blood feeding inhibition, induced exophily and killing effect were
   measured to assess the bio-efficacy. The results were compared with
   Olyset Net (R), a polyethylene permethrin-incorporated LLIN and a
   conventionally treated polyester net (with permethrin) washed to just
   before exhaustion.
   Results: Results showed significant reduction in entry (treatment:
   0.4-0.8; control: 4.2 per trap-night) and increase in exit (56.3-82.9 \%
   and 44.2 \%) rates of Anopheles fluviatilis in the treatment arms
   compared to control (P < 0.05). While blood feeding rates declined in
   treatment arms (18.8-30.6 \%), it increased in control (77.6 \%) (P <
   0.05). This was further evident from the blood-feeding inhibition rates
   in treatment arms (60.6-90.6 \%). Total mortality was significantly
   higher in all treatment arms (96.3-100 \%) compared to control arm (2
   \%) (P < 0.05). Chemical analysis for active ingredient (AI) showed
   retention of 75 and 88 \% in Olyset plus and Olyset net respectively
   after 20 washes. Performance of Olyset Plus washed 20 times was equal to
   the CTN and Olyset Net against the susceptible malaria vector An.
   fluviatilis, fulfilling the WHO efficacy criteria of Phase II evaluation
   for LLIN. However, the benefit of incorporating PBO and permethrin
   together in a long-lasting treatment could not be demonstrated in the
   current study as the target vector species was fully susceptible to
   pyrethroids.
   Conclusion: Olyset Plus, with its intrinsic bio-efficacy could be an
   effective vector control tool to prevent transmission of malaria by
   susceptible vectors like An. fluviatilis. However, the results of the
   current study need to be further supported by testing the net at village
   level (Phase III) for community acceptability. Before taking the net to
   village level, it needs to be verified whether the net is better than
   pyrethroid nets in terms of bio-efficacy against resistant An.
   culicifacies, another malaria vector that has developed resistance to
   synthetic pyrethroids in India.}},

   multiple roles in physiological as well as cellular immune responses.
   However, the molecular nature of hemocytes in blood feeding insects,

   molecular composition of naive mosquito hemocyte encoded proteins, we
   sequenced RNA-Seq library and analyzed a total of 13,105,858 Illumina
   sequencing reads in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, an urban malarial
   vector in India. Denovo assembly approach yielded a buildup of 3025
   contigs, for molecular and functional annotation. A total of 1829
   contigs (48\%) could be mapped to the mosquito transcript database,
   while out of remaining 1196 unmatched contigs, at least 1108 contigs
   i.e. 40\% of total contigs, yielded a significant match to the available

   comprehensive molecular analysis of several unique transcripts including
   novel LRR, Holotricin, OBP, NiFU, that are involved in immunity, chemo

   provides initial evidence that mosquito hemocytes carry unique ability
   to meet and manage cell specific diverse functions of the mosquito

Abstract = {{Background
   The resistance status of malaria vectors to different classes of
   insecticides used for public health has raised concern for vector
   control programmes. Alternative compounds to supplement the existing
   tools are important to be searched to overcome the existing resistance
   and persistence of pesticides in vectors and the environment
   respectively. The mosquitocidal effects of Glycosmis pentaphylla using
   different solvents of acetone, methanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate
   extracts against three medically important mosquito vectors was
   conducted.
   Methods
   Glycosmis pentaphylla plant leaves were collected from Kolli Hills,
   India. The WHO test procedures for larval and adult bioassays were used
   to evaluate extracts against mosquito vectors, and the chemical
   composition of extracts identified using GC-MS analysis.
   Results
   The larvicidal and adulticidal activity of G. pentaphylla plant extracts
   clearly impacted the three species of major mosquitoes vectors. Acetone
   extracts had the highest larvicidal effect against An. stephensi, Cx.
   quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti with the LC50 and LC90 values of
   0.0004, 138.54; 0.2669, 73.7413 and 0.0585, 303.746 mg/ml, respectively.
   The LC50 and LC90 adulticide values of G. pentaphylla leaf extracts in
   acetone, methanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate, solvents were as
   follows for Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi and Ae. Aegypti: 2.957,
   5.458, 2.708, and 4.777, 3.449, 6.676 mg/ml respectively. The chemical
   composition of G. pentaphylla leaf extract has been found in 20 active
   compounds.
   Conclusions
   The plant leaf extracts of G. pentaphylla bioactive molecules which are
   effective and can be developed as an eco-friendly approach for
   larvicides and adulticidal mosquitoes vector control. Detailed
   identification and characterization of mosquitocidal effect of
   individual bioactive molecules ingredient may result into biodegradable
   effective tools for the control of mosquito vectors.}},

Title = {{A Critical Review of All Known Published Records for Water Mite (Acari:

Abstract = {{All published records of water mite-mosquito parasitic associations
   since Gary R. Mullen's comprehensive review in the 1970s of the
   literature were critiqued to provide an up-to-date account on the
   identity of water mites parasitizing mosquitoes and their geographic
   distribution. In total, 321 records in 62 sources were identified, with
   each record representing an association specific to a state, province,
   or region within a country. The greatest number of records were from the
   United States (120), followed by India (106) and Canada (40). In all,
   105 species of mosquitoes were parasitized, with the majority belonging
   to the genera Aedes sensu lato (30), Anopheles (30), and Culex (21).
   Records were biased toward mosquito genera with the greatest number of
   freshwater species and medical importance. Most water mites belonged to
   the genus Arrenurus, or were Parathyas barbigera (Viets 1908). Arrenurus
   water mites were often not identified to species, but 15 different
   Arrenurus species were determined in 119 records. All but one of the
   species (i.e., Arrenurus madaraszi Daday 1898) were only reported from
   Canada, Germany, or the United States. Although a greater proportion of
   sources reviewed by us compared with Mullen's review identified water
   mites down to the level of genus, to better understand the biological
   significance of mite and mosquito interactions, more of an effort is
   needed to identify the species of water mites. The availability of
   molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding will make this goal more
   attainable.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of various mosquito vectors is important
   in the determination of disease prevalence in disease endemic areas. The
   aim of the present study was to conduct regular entomological
   surveillance and to determine the relative abundance of tree hole
   mosquito species in Tamilnadu, India. In addition to this, the impact of
   weather-conditions on tree hole mosquito population were evaluated
   between June, 2014 and May, 2015. Six hills ranges viz., Anaimalai
   hills, Kodaikanal hills, Sitheri hills, Kolli hills, Yercaud hills, and
   Megamalai were selected, the immatures collected from tree holes by the
   help of suction tube. Collections were made at dusk and dawn at randomly
   selected 15 different tree species. The collected samples were stored
   and morphologically identified to species level in the laboratory.
   Mosquito diversity was calculated by Simpson's and Shannon-Weiner
   diversity indicies with spatial and temporal aspects. Over 2642
   mosquitoes comprising the primary vectors of dengue, chickungunya,
   malaria, filariasis were identified. Other species collected from the
   fifteen sites in each hill during the study included Christophersiomyia
   annularis, Christophersiomyia thomsoni, Downsiomyia albolateralis,
   Downsiomyia nivea and Toxorhynchites splendens, etc. Study revealed high
   species diversity and relative density associated with different study
   sites. Based on the Shannon diversity index high number of species was
   recorded with Aedes pseudoalbopicta (0.0829) followed by Ae. aegypti
   (0.0805) and least species was recorded as Anopheles elegans (0.0059).
   The distribution of the primary vectors of DF along the high occurrence
   was evident with most study sites representing proportions of this
   vector population. This showed the high risk level associated with the
   livestock movement in amplification and circulation of the virus during
   the outbreaks. The findings of this study, therefore, demonstrated the
   potential vulnerability of nomadic communities to infection by arboviral
   diseases transmitted by mosquito vectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Overhead tank is the potential breeding habitat of Anopheles stephensi
   in an urban transmission setting of Chennai, India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wells and overhead tanks (OHT) are the major breeding
   sources of the local malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi in the Indian
   city of Chennai; they play a significant role in vector breeding, and
   transmission of urban malaria. Many other man-made breeding habitats,
   such as cemented cisterns/containers, barrels or drums, sumps or
   underground tanks, and plastic pots/containers are maintained to
   supplement water needs, temporarily resulting in enhanced
   mosquito/vector breeding. Correlating breeding habitats with immature
   vector abundance is important in effective planning to strengthen
   operational execution of vector control measures.
   Methods: A year-long, weekly study was conducted in Chennai to inspect
   available clear/clean water mosquito breeding habitats. Different
   breeding features, such as instar-wise, immature density and
   co-inhabitation with other mosquito species, were analysed. The
   characteristics of breeding habitats, i.e., type of habitat, water
   temperature and presence of aquatic organisms, organic matter and green
   algal remnants on the water surface at the time of inspection, were also
   studied. Immature density of vector was correlated with presence of
   other mosquito species, malaria prevalence, habitat characteristics and
   monthly/seasonal fluctuations. All the data collected from field
   observations were analysed using standard statistical tools.
   Results: When the immature density of breeding habitats was analysed,
   using one-way ANOVA, it was observed that the density did not change in
   a significant way either across seasons or months. OHTs contributed
   significantly to the immature population when compared to wells and
   other breeding habitats of the study site. The habitat positivity of
   wells and OHTs was significantly associated with the presence of aquatic
   organisms, organic matter and algal remnants. Significant correlations
   of malaria prevalence with monthly immature density, as well as number
   of breeding habitats with immature vector mosquitoes, were also
   observed.
   Conclusions: The findings that OHTs showed fairly high and consistent
   immature density of An. stephensi irrespective of seasons indicates the
   potentiality of the breeding habitat in contributing to vector density.
   The correlation between vector breeding habitats, immature density and
   malaria prevalence indicates the proximity of these habitats to malaria
   cases, proving its role in vector abundance and local malaria
   transmission. The preference of An. stephensi to breed in OHTs calls for
   intensified, appropriate and sustained intervention measures to curtail
   vector breeding and propagation to shrink malaria to pre-elimination
   level and beyond.}},

Title = {{Species composition and population dynamics of malaria vectors in three
   previously ignored aquatic systems in Sri Lanka}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: In 2015 alone there were an estimated 214 million new cases
   of malaria across the globe and 438,000 deaths were reported. Although
   indigenous malaria has not been reported in Sri Lanka since 2012, to
   date 247 imported cases of malaria have been identified. Knowledge of
   the locations, behaviour and vectorial capacity of potential malarial
   vectors is therefore needed to prevent future outbreaks. Attention is
   now being focused on some previously ignored habitats.
   Methods: Active and abandoned granite and clay quarry pits, located in
   wet and intermediate zones, and agro wells located in the dry zone of
   Sri Lanka were mapped and sampled for 1 year, as potential mosquito
   breeding sites. Species composition and spatio-temporal variation in
   both malarial and other mosquito larvae were recorded.
   Results: A total of 18 species of mosquito larvae were identified. Other
   than Anopheles culicifacies, the primary malaria vector, five species of
   potential malaria vectors (Anopheles vagus, Anopheles varuna, Anopheles
   nigerrimus, Anopheles peditaeniatus and Anopheles barbirostris) were
   found in all three aquatic systems. Additionally, Anopheles annularis
   was found in granite quarries and Anopheles subpictus and Anopheles
   pallidus in both types of quarry, but only during the initial sampling.
   Apart from potential malaria vectors, mosquito larvae such as Anopheles
   jamesii, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex infula and Culex malayi were
   found in all three habitats at least once during the sampling period.
   Apart from potential malaria vectors and other mosquito larvae common to
   all three aquatic systems, Culex gelidus, Culex mimulus and Culex pseudo
   vishnui were detected in agro wells. Culex gelidus was also detected in
   granite quarry pits. Culex mimulus, Culex lutzia and Culex fuscocephala
   were detected in clay quarry pits. Accordingly, a total of 14, 13 and 15
   mosquito species were identified in agro wells, granite and clay quarry
   pits, respectively.
   Conclusions: Although zero occurrence of indigenous malaria has been
   achieved in Sri Lanka, the current study emphasizes the potential for
   future epidemics. The presence of native flora and fauna in abandoned
   granite and clay quarry pits and the need to extract drinking water from
   agro wells demand bio-sensitive control methods in these three aquatic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Insecticide resistance to synthetic chemical insecticides is
   a worldwide concern in phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae),
   the vectors of Leishmania spp. parasites. The CDC bottle bioassay
   assesses resistance by testing populations against verified diagnostic
   doses and diagnostic times for an insecticide, but the assay has been
   used limitedly with sand flies. The objective of this study was to
   determine diagnostic doses and diagnostic times for laboratory Lutzomyia
   longipalpis (Lutz \& Nieva) and Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) to ten
   insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, and
   DDT, that are used worldwide to control vectors.
   Methods: Bioassays were conducted in 1,000-ml glass bottles each
   containing 10-25 sand flies from laboratory colonies of L. longipalpis
   or P. papatasi. Four pyrethroids, three organophosphates, two carbamates
   and one organochlorine, were evaluated. A series of concentrations were
   tested for each insecticide, and four replicates were conducted for each
   concentration. Diagnostic doses were determined only during the exposure
   bioassay for the organophosphates and carbamates. For the pyrethroids
   and DDT, diagnostic doses were determined for both the exposure bioassay
   and after a 24-hour recovery period.
   Results: Both species are highly susceptible to the carbamates as their
   diagnostic doses are under 7.0 mu g/ml. Both species are also highly
   susceptible to DDT during the exposure assay as their diagnostic doses
   are 7.5 mu g/ml, yet their diagnostic doses for the 24-h recovery period
   are 650.0 mu g/ml for Lu. longipalpis and 470.0 mu g/ml for P. papatasi.
   Conclusions: Diagnostic doses and diagnostic times can now be
   incorporated into vector management programs that use the CDC bottle
   bioassay to assess insecticide resistance in field populations of Lu.
   longipalpis and P. papatasi. These findings provide initial starting
   points for determining diagnostic doses and diagnostic times for other
   sand fly vector species and wild populations using the CDC bottle
   bioassay.}},

   for malaria prevention. The World Health Organization Pesticide
   Evaluation Scheme has established evaluation criteria to facilitate
   registration for public use. A household randomised trial was conducted
   in Tanzania according to WHOPES Phase III procedures to evaluate the
   alpha-cypermethrin coated Interceptor (R) LN (BASF) over three years'
   use. Outcomes were calibrated against results of Phase II experimental
   hut trials.
   Methods: Interceptor LN (200 mg/m(2) alpha-cypermethrin) and
   conventionally treated nets CTN (40 mg/m(2) alpha-cypermethrin) were
   randomly distributed to 934 households. At 6-monthly intervals,
   household surveys recorded net use, durability, adverse effects, user
   acceptance and washing practices. Concurrently, 30 nets of each type
   were collected and tested for knock-down and kill of Anopheles gambiae
   mosquitoes in cone and tunnel bioassays. Alpha-cypermethrin content of
   nets was assessed annually.
   Results: At 12 months 97 \% of Interceptor LN met the efficacy criteria
   by cone or tunnel test; this pass rate declined to 90 \% at 24 months
   and 87 \% at 36 months. In contrast only 63 \% of CTN met the efficacy
   criteria at 12 months, 14 \% at 24 months and 0 \% at 36 months. The
   alpha-cypermethrin content at 36 months on Interceptor LN was 20 \% (42
   +/- 13 mg/m(2)) of the initial content but on CTNs only 4 \% (1.3 +/-
   1.6 mg/m(2)) remained. Interceptor LN was reported to be used year-round
   and washed 4.3 times/year. A few recalled facial tingling during the
   first days of use but this did not deter usage. The average number of
   holes at 36 months was 18, hole area per net was 229 cm(2) and hole
   index was 332. Insecticide content and cone bioefficacy of LN and CTN
   after 36 months' use were similar to that of LN and CTN used in earlier
   Phase II hut trials, but while the 20 times washed LN tested in
   experimental huts gave adequate personal protection the 20 times washed
   CTN did not.
   Conclusions: More than 80 \% Interceptor LN fulfilled the WHOPES Phase
   III criteria at 36 months and thus the LLIN was granted full WHO
   recommendation. Phase III outcomes at 36 months were anticipated by
   Phase II outcomes after 20 standardized washes.}},

Title = {{Malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies sibling species differentiation
   using egg morphometry and morphology}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: The malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies (sensu lato) is an
   important malaria vector in Southeast Asia which comprises of five
   sibling species namely A, B, C, D and E. However, only a few forms have
   been identified as malaria vectors in various endemic countries.
   Currently, for the first time egg morphometry and morphology has been
   used to differentiate the three known vector sibling species of
   Anopheles culicifacies collected from malaria endemic Madhya Pradesh
   state of central India.
   Methods: The adult An. culicifacies (s.l.) was collected from five
   districts using standard mosquito collection methods. Adult female
   mosquitoes were allowed to lay eggs individually. The emerged mosquitoes
   were identified using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR)
   to sibling species. Eggs of sibling species A, D and E were studied
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphometric and
   morphological characteristics.
   Results: Currently AS-PCR identified four known sibling species (B, C, D
   and E) of An. culicifacies in the study area. The surface morphology and
   morphometric attributes of the sibling species A, D and E eggs
   considerably differed from each other. An. culicifacies E had a narrow
   deck as compared to A and D, while An. culicifacies A had a bigger
   micropyle with 6-7 sectors as compared to D and E that had 6 sectors.
   An. culicifacies D had the smallest float (the structure present on
   sides of the egg surface in which air is filled that help in floating)
   and the number of ribs was also fewer than for An. culicifacies A and E.
   Conclusions: The present study provides the first evidence that in
   addition to PCR assay, sibling species of An. culicifacies can also be
   differentiated using morphological and morphometric characteristics of
   the egg stage. The results also advocate that the sibling species of An.
   culicifacies are morphologically dissimilar and can be resolved using
   advanced microscopy.}},

   markers. Significantly high genetic differentiation was found in all
   studied populations with differentiation values (F-ST) ranging from
   0.0398 to 0.1808. The geographic distance was found to be playing a
   major role in genetic differentiation between different populations.
   Overall three genetic pools were observed and population of central
   India was found to be coexisting in two genetic pools. High effective
   population size (Ne) was found in all the studied populations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During the recent past, development of DDT resistance and reduction to
   pyrethroid susceptibility among the malaria vectors has posed a serious
   challenge in many Southeast Asian countries including India. Current
   study presents the insecticide susceptibility and knockdown data of
   field collected Anopheles annularis sensu lato and An. vagus mosquito
   species from endemic areas of Assam in northeast India. Anopheles
   annularis s.l. and An. vagus adult females were collected from four
   randomly selected sentinel sites in Orang primary health centre (OPHC)
   and Balipara primary health centre (BPHC) areas, and used for testing
   susceptibility to DDT, malathion, deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.
   After insecticide susceptibility tests, mosquitoes were subjected to
   VectorTest (TM) assay kits to detect the presence of malaria sporozoite
   in the mosquitoes. An. annularis s.l. was completely susceptible to
   deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and malathion in both the study areas.
   An. vagus was highly susceptible to deltamethrin in both the areas, but
   exhibited reduced susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin in BPHC. Both the
   species were resistant to DDT and showed very high KDT50 and KDT99
   values for DDT. Probit model used to calculate the KDT50 and KDT99
   values did not display normal distribution of percent knock-down with
   time for malathion in both the mosquito species in OPHC (p<0.05) and An.
   vagus in BPHC (chi(2) = 25.3; p = 0.0), and also for deltamethrin to An.
   vagus in BPHC area (chi(2) = 15.4; p = 0.004). Minimum infection rate
   (MIR) of Plasmodium sporozoite for An. vagus was 0.56 in OPHC and 0.13
   in BPHC, while for An. annularis MIR was found to be 0.22 in OPHC.
   Resistance management strategies should be identified to delay the
   expansion of resistance. Testing of field caught Anopheles vectors from
   different endemic areas for the presence of malaria sporozoite may be
   useful to ensure their role in malaria transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects resulting from mutation(s) in the
   voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene is one of the mechanisms of
   resistance against DDT and the pyrethroid group of insecticides.
   Earlier, we reported the presence of two classic kdr mutations, i.e.,
   L1014F and L1014S in Anopheles stephensi Liston, a major Indian malaria
   vector affecting mainly urban areas. This report presents the
   distribution of these alleles in different An. stephensi populations.
   Seven populations of An. stephensi from six states of India were
   screened for the presence of two alternative kdr mutations L1014F and
   L1014S using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We
   recorded the presence of both kdr mutations in northern Indian
   populations (Alwar and Gurgaon), with the preponderance of L1014S,
   whereas only L1014F was present in Raipur (central India) and Chennai
   (southern India). None of the kdr mutations were found in Ranchi in
   eastern India and in Mangaluru and Mysuru in southern India. This study
   provides evidence for a focal pattern of distribution of kdr alleles in
   India.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 39 strains of Anopheles stephensi, an important urban malaria
   vector, were collected from various parts of India and maintained in the
   insectary for this study. Based on the egg-float ridge number, 19
   strains were classified into ecological variants and 32 strains were
   exposed to chlorpyrifos and propoxur to investigate their resistance
   status. Filter paper containing freshly laid eggs was taken, the ridge
   numbers on the floats were counted under the microscope, and strains
   were classified into ecological variants. Of the 19 strains, 18 were of
   `type form', with ridge numbers ranging from 15 to 21. The
   Papareddipalya (PRP) strain belonged to the `intermediate form', with 14
   to 17 ridge numbers. Larval bioassays were carried out according to the
   procedure of the WHO. For chlorpyrifos, the lowest LC50 value was
   0.00107mg/l (Padmanabhanagar strain) and the highest value was
   0.0403mg/l (GOA-A strain). Furthermore, the lowest LC90 value was
   0.00368mg/l (Delhi strain) and the highest was 0.1746mg/l (GOA-A
   strain). For propoxur, the lowest LC50 value was 0.00029mg/l
   (Goraguntepalya strain) and the highest value was 0.0037 mg/l (JP Nagar
   strain). Moreover, the lowest LC90 value was 0.00094mg/l (Goraguntepalya

   tolerance values ranged from 1.26 to 37.68 for chlorpyrifos and from
   1.34 to 12.77 for propoxur. All the type forms were from urban and
   semi-urban locations, and the intermediate strain was from a semi-urban

Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: India contributes 1.5-2 million annual confirmed cases of
   malaria. Since both parasites and vectors are evolving rapidly, updated
   information on parasite prevalence in mosquitoes is important for vector
   management and disease control. Possible new vector-parasite
   interactions in Goa, India were tested.
   Methods: A total of 1036 CDC traps were placed at four malaria endemic
   foci in Goa, India from May 2013 to April 2015. These captured 23,782
   mosquitoes, of which there were 1375 female anopheline specimens with
   ten species identified using morphological keys. Mosquito DNA was
   analysed for human and bovine blood as well as for Plasmodium falciparum
   and Plasmodium vivax infection.
   Results: Human host feeding was confirmed in Anopheles stephensi (30
   \%), Anopheles subpictus (27 \%), Anopheles jamesii (22 \%), Anopheles
   annularis (26 \%), and Anopheles nigerrimus (16 \%). In contrast,
   Anopheles vagus, Anopheles barbirostris, Anopheles tessellates,
   Anopheles umbrosus and Anopheles karwari specimens were negative for
   human blood. Importantly, An. subpictus, which was considered a
   non-vector in Goa and Western India, was found to be a dominant vector
   in terms of both total number of mosquitoes collected as well as
   Plasmodium carriage. Plasmodium infections were detected in 14 An.
   subpictus (2.8 \%), while the traditional vector, An. stephensi, showed
   seven total infections, two of which were in the salivary glands. Of the
   14 An. subpictus infections, nested PCR demonstrated three Plasmodium
   infections in the salivary glands: one P. vivax and two mixed infections
   of P. falciparum and P. vivax. In addition, ten gut infections (one P.
   vivax, six P. falciparum and three mixed infections) were seen in An.
   subpictus. Longitudinal mosquito collections pointed to a bimodal annual
   appearance of An. subpictus to maintain a perennial malaria transmission
   cycle of both P. vivax and P. falciparum in Goa.}},

Abstract = {{Study of mosquito species diversity and its relationship with ecosystems
   is essential to understand disease epidemiology and to develop control
   measures of vector populations in human-dominated ecosystems. In the
   present study, the structure and composition of immature mosquito
   population and associated ecological parameters were analysed in three
   different ecosystems (urban, semi-urban and rural) along Vaigai river,
   Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Average larval density was higher in urban
   than the semi-urban and rural sites during the study period. In 2012-13,
   immature mosquito diversity was higher in rural site during pre-monsoon
   and monsoon seasons, whereas mosquito larval diversity was greater in
   semi-urban site during the post-monsoon season. In 2013-14, mosquito
   larval diversity was found to be high in semi-urban site during monsoon
   and post-monsoon seasons. Culicine species dominated the urban areas,
   while Anopheline species dominated the rural and semi-urban sites during
   the study period. Among the mosquito species, Culex tritaeniorhynchus,
   Cx. geldius, Cx. vishnuvi, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus,
   Anopheles subpictus and An. culicifacies were prevalent throughout the
   year. Filamentous algal-dominated sites showed a higher number of
   mosquito species (23 species) than other hydrophytes-dominated sites.
   Maximum number of sewage inlets was recorded in urban than the other two
   sites. As a result, the highest turbidity level was recorded in the
   urban site followed by semi-urban and rural sites. The present study
   shows that the immature mosquito population is maintained with the help
   of ecological parameters in all the study sites throughout the year.
   Therefore, it is essential to take steps to eradicate the mosquito
   vectors from the Vaigai river basin to avoid disease outbreak in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, malaria in India was predominantly caused by Plasmodium
   vivax, accounting for 53\% of the estimated cases. After the spread of
   drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the 1990s, the prevalence of the
   two species remained equivalent at the national level for a decade. By
   2014, the proportion of P.vivax has decreased to 34\% nationally, but
   with high regional variation. In 2014, P.vivax accounted for around
   380,000 malaria cases in India; almost a sixth of all P.vivax cases
   reported globally. Plasmodium vivax has remained resistant to control
   measures, particularly in urban areas. Urban malaria is predominantly
   caused by P.vivax and is subject to outbreaks, often associated with
   increased mortality, and triggered by bursts of migration and
   construction. The epidemiology of P.vivax varies substantially within
   India, including multiple relapse phenotypes with varying latencies
   between primary infection and relapse. Moreover, the hypnozoite
   reservoir maintains transmission potential and enables reestablishment
   of the parasite in areas in which it was thought eradicated. The burden
   of malaria in India is complex because of the highly variable malaria
   eco-epidemiological profiles, transmission factors, and the presence of
   multiple Plasmodium species and Anopheles vectors. This review of
   P.vivax malaria in India describes epidemiological trends with
   particular attention to four states: Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, and
   Odisha.}},

Abstract = {{We used the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate-H climate
   model with the A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios for the years
   2050 and 2100 and CLIMEX software for projections to illustrate the
   potential impact of climate change on the spatial distributions of
   malaria in China, India, Indochina, Indonesia, and The Philippines based
   on climate variables such as temperature, moisture, heat, cold and
   dryness. The model was calibrated using data from several knowledge
   domains, including geographical distribution records. The areas in which
   malaria has currently been detected are consistent with those showing
   high values of the ecoclimatic index in the CLIMEX model. The match
   between prediction and reality was found to be high. More than 90\% of
   the observed malaria distribution points were associated with the
   currently known suitable climate conditions. Climate suitability for
   malaria is projected to decrease in India, southern Myanmar, southern
   Thailand, eastern Borneo, and the region bordering Cambodia, Malaysia
   and the Indonesian islands, while it is expected to increase in southern
   and south-eastern China and Taiwan. The climatic models for Anopheles
   mosquitoes presented here should be useful for malaria control,
   monitoring, and management, particularly considering these future

   the detection of 16 haplotypes among 30 sequences of ND5 gene and 29
   haplotypes among 29 COII sequences. Anopheles nivipes of north-east
   India was significantly differentiated genetically with that of
   neighboring South-east Asian An. nivipes as revealed by pairwise F-ST
   values of 0.127 (p < 0.01) and 0.044 (p < 0.001) for ND5 and COII genes,

Abstract = {{Malaria is endemic and a major public health problem in north east (NE)
   region of India and contributes about 8-12\% of India's malaria
   positives cases. Historical morbidity pattern of malaria in terms of API
   (Annual Parasite Incidence) in the state of Assam has been used for
   delineating the malaria incidence hotspots at health sub centre (HSC)
   level. Strong spatial autocorrelation (p<0.01) among the HSCs have been
   observed in terms of API (Annual Parasite Incidence). Malaria incidence
   hot spots in the state could be identified based on General G statistics
   and tested for statistical significance. Spatial correlation of malaria
   incidence hotspots with physiographic and climatic parameters across 6
   agro-climatic zones of the state reveals the types of land cover pattern
   and the range of elevation contributing to the malaria outbreaks.
   Analysis shows that villages under malaria hotspots are having more
   agricultural land, evergreen/semi-evergreen forests with abundant
   waterbodies. Statistical and spatial analyses of malaria incidence
   showed a significant positive correlation with malaria incidence
   hotspots and the elevation (p<0.05) with villages under malaria hotspots
   are having average elevation ranging between 17 to 240 MSL. This
   conforms to the characteristics of two dominant mosquito species in the
   state Anopheles minimus and An. baimai that prefers the habitat of slow
   flowing streams in the foot hills and in forest ecosystems respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a key threat for millions of people
   worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating pathogens and
   parasites. The standard method of utilisation of morphological
   characters becomes challenging due to various factors such as
   phenotypical variations. We explored the complementary approach of CO1
   gene-based identification, analysing ten species of mosquito vectors
   belonging to three genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles from India.
   Analysed nucleotide sequences were found without pseudo genes and
   indels; they match with high similarity in nucleotide Basic Local
   Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) search. The partial CO1 sequence of
   Anopheles niligricus was the first time record submitted to National
   Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Mean intra-and interspecies
   divergence was found to be 1.30 and 3.83 \%, respectively. The
   congeneric divergence was three times higher than the conspecifics. Deep
   intraspecific divergence was noted in three of the species, and the
   reason could be explained more accurately in the future by improving the
   sample size across different locations. The transitional and
   transversional substitutions were tested individually. Ts and Tv
   substitutions in all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codons were estimated to be
   (0.44, 99.51), (40.35, 59.66) and (59.16, 40.84), respectively.
   Saturation of the sequences was resolved, since both the Ts and Tv
   exhibited a linear relationship suggesting that the sequences were not
   saturated. NJ and ML tree analysis showed that the individuals of the
   same species clustered together based on the CO1 sequence similarity,
   regardless of their collection site and geographic location. Overall,
   this study adds basic knowledge to molecular evolution of mosquito
   vectors of medical and veterinary importance and may be useful to
   improve biotechnological tools employed in Culicidae control programmes.}},

Title = {{Molecular characterization of midgut microbiota of Aedes albopictus and
   Aedes aegypti from Arunachal Pradesh, India}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbiota inhabiting midguts of mosquitoes play a key role
   in the host - parasite interaction and enhance vectorial capacity of
   viral diseases like dengue and chikungunya fevers. Mosquito midgut is
   considered to be an important site for host-pathogen interaction and
   pathogen survival is thought to be an outcome of this interaction. In
   the present study we examined the bacterial community in the midgut of
   Aedes mosquitoes in Arunanchal Pradesh, India, a subtropical zone where
   dengue fever is reported to be emerging.
   Method: Larvae and pupa of Aedes mosquitoes were collected from a
   biodiversity hotspot, Bhalukpong, Arunachal Pradesh, India. 16S rRNA
   gene sequences were used for identification of isolated bacterial
   population from each species of mosquitoes. We used various diversity
   indices to assess the diversity and richness of the bacterial isolates
   in both mosquito species.
   Result: On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis a total of 24
   bacterial species from 13 genera were identified belonging to 10
   families of four major phyla. Phylum Proteobacteria was dominant
   followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The midgut
   bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were
   isolated from both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, whereas, bacteria
   belonging to phylum Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were isolated only
   from Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti respectively. Enterobacter cloacae
   was the dominant bacterial species in both Ae. albopictus (33.65 \%) and
   Ae. aegypti (56.45 \%). Bacillus aryabhattai (22.78 \%) was the second
   most common bacterial species in Ae. albopictus whereas, in Ae. aegypti
   the second most common bacterial species was Stenotrophomonas
   maltophilia (7.44 \%).
   Conclusion: The family Enterobacteriaceae of phylum Proteobacteria was
   dominant in both species of Aedes mosquitoes. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first attempt to study midgut microbiota from a
   biodiversity hotspot in Northeastern India. Some bacterial genera
   Enterobacter and Acinetobacter isolated in this study are known to play
   important roles in parasite-vector interaction. Information on midgut
   microflora may lead towards the development of novel, safe, and
   effective strategies to manipulate the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Malaria is a major public health problem in
   Tripura and focal disease outbreaks are of frequent occurrence. The
   State is co-endemic for both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax and
   transmission is perennial and persistent. The present study was aimed to
   review data on disease distribution to prioritize high-risk districts,
   and to study seasonal prevalence of disease vectors and their bionomical
   characteristics to help formulate vector species-specific interventions
   for malaria control.
   Methods: Data on malaria morbidity in the State were reviewed
   retrospectively (2008-2012) for understanding disease distribution and
   transmission dynamics. Cross-sectional mass blood surveys were conducted
   in malaria endemic villages of South Tripura district to ascertain the
   prevalence of malaria and proportions of parasite species. Mosquito
   collections were made in human dwellings of malaria endemic villages
   aiming at vector incrimination and to study relative abundance, resting
   and feeding preferences, and their present susceptibility status to DDT.
   Results: The study showed that malaria was widely prevalent and P.
   falciparum was the predominant infection (>90\%), the remaining were P.
   vivax cases. The disease distribution, however, was uneven with large
   concentration of cases in districts of South Tripura and Dhalai
   coinciding with vast forest cover and tribal populations. Both Anopheles
   minimus s.s. and An. baimaii were recorded to be prevalent and observed
   to be highly anthropophagic and susceptible to DDT. Of these, An.
   minimus was incriminated (sporozoite infection rate 4.92\%), and its
   bionomical characteristics revealed this species to be largely indoor
   resting and endophagic.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: For effective control of malaria in the
   State, it is recommended that diseases surveillance should be robust,
   and vector control interventions including DDT spray coverage, mass
   distribution of insecticide-treated nets/long-lasting insecticidal nets
   should be intensified prioritizing population groups most at risk to
   avert impending disease outbreaks and spread of drug-resistant malaria.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: In Odisha State, the control of malaria
   vectors has become dependent on synthetic pyrethroids, which are used
   for treatment of all approved long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs).
   The vast use of just one class of insecticide has led to the problem of
   resistance to insecticides in malaria vectors. One of the major malaria
   vectors in Odisha State is Anopheles culicifacies Giles. The aim of this
   study was to determine the resistance status of An. culicifacies to
   deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid and other common insecticides used
   by the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) for
   indoor residual spraying in Odisha State.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected during April 2014 - June 2014 from 15
   randomly selected villages in five Plasmodium falciparum endemic
   southern districts of Odisha State. The blood-fed wild caught females
   were exposed to the diagnostic dosage of DDT (4.0\%), malathion (5.0\%)
   and deltamethrin (0.05\%) for one hour. Mortality was recorded at 24 h
   after the exposure.
   Results: Results indicated that An. culicifacies was resistant to all
   the three insecticides used in the malaria control programme in the five
   districts of Odisha State.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Resistance management strategy by
   appropriate rotation of different groups of insecticides including
   carbamates and incorporating a synergist with synthetic pyrethroids for
   treating mosquito nets should be considered for the control of malaria
   vectors in the area, especially where An. culicifacies is predominant.
   Periodical monitoring of susceptibility/resistance status of An.
   culicifacies to different insecticides is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Dengue infection is endemic in several areas
   and the dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Thus, it
   becomes important to understand the breeding ecology of dengue vector
   and characterize the physicochemical parameters of its breeding habitat.
   The objective of this study was to analyze the physicochemical
   parameters of the breeding habitat of the dengue vector and to find out
   the nutrient composition of the habitat in and around Kolkata, West
   Bengal. In addition, a geographic information system (GIS) was used to
   map the disease prone areas for its effective management and prevention.
   Methods: Water samples were collected from various breeding habitats of
   Aedes mosquitoes of Kolkata and adjoining areas and were analysed for
   various physicochemical properties like acidity, alkalinity, hardness,
   electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, concentration of
   chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), fluoride (F-) in relation
   to larval prevalence.
   Results: Parameters like water pH, total dissolved solids, total
   hardness, electrical conductivity, concentration of chloride, sodium and
   potassium were seen to vary throughout the year. Certain parameters were
   found to be dependent on container type, like concentration of fluoride.
   Significant positive correlations were seen between per dip larval
   density and total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Water pH, electrical conductivity, total
   dissolved solids were seen to play a major role in the ovipositional
   preferences. Container type did not seem to affect TDS. Tyres had the
   highest TDS in most of the cases. Nutrient composition like sodium
   concentration was mostly found in the coconut shells, potassium
   concentration also showed the same. Thus, container type and various
   parameters and nutrients play a major role in determining where a gravid
   female mosquito will lay its eggs. It was observed that by altering
   various chemical and physical properties of breeding habitats it was
   possible to control the larvae survivability.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Control of vivax malaria is challenging due to
   persistence of hypnozoites causing relapses and safety concerns with
   primaquine in G6PD deficient individuals. We present the epidemiology of
   malaria with emphasis on recurrence of vivax malaria over a period of
   four years in southwest Delhi among patients reporting to malaria
   clinic.
   Methods: Microscopic examination of stained blood smears of fever
   patients attending malaria clinic was performed. Confirmed malaria cases
   were treated as per the national treatment guidelines. The
   epidemiological data of confirmed malaria cases including demographic
   characteristics, age, gender and past history of malaria were analysed.
   Patients were asked to report in case of occurence of fever.
   Results: From January 2011 to December 2014, 429 Plasmodium vivax, 24 P.
   falciparum and three mixed infection cases were reported to the Malaria
   Clinic at National Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi. Malaria
   cases peaked in the months of August and September during all the four
   years. Recurrent episodes of vivax malaria were observed in 14.72\%
   patients to whom primaquine was not dispensed, while the prevalence was
   4.02\% among those who received primaquine. The relapsing patterns
   observed were of both short as well as long latency P. vivax phenotypes.
   The entomological survey of area from where malaria patients reported,
   showed prevalence of Anopheles stephensi.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The study showed presence of persistent P.
   vivax malaria with strains causing both frequent and long latency
   recurrences (probable relapses) in southwest Delhi. This highlights the
   need to evaluate primaquine regimens against both these strains and
   formulate strategies to improve compliance to 14-days primaquine
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria causes extensive morbidity and mortality in humans and results
   in significant economic losses in India. The distribution of immature
   malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes was studied in 17 villages in
   Coimbatore District as a prelude to the development and implementation
   of vector control strategies that are intended to reduce the risk of
   human exposure to potentially infectious mosquitoes. Eight Anopheles
   species were recorded. The most numerous species were Anopheles vagus,
   Anopheles subpictus, and Anopheles hyrcanus. The location of mosquito
   development sites and the density of larvae in each village was
   evaluated for correlation with selected demographic, biologic, and land
   use parameters using remote sensing and geographic information systems
   (GIS) technology. We found the number of mosquito development sites in a
   village and the density of larvae in such sites to be positively
   correlated with human population density but not the surface area
   (km(2)) of the village. The number of mosquito development sites and the
   density of larvae in each site were not correlated. Data from this study
   are being used to construct a GIS-based mapping system that will enable
   the location of aquatic habitats with Anopheles larvae in the Coimbatore

   similarity in SH2 domain and SOCS box region with other mosquito
   species. However, its N-terminal identity is limited to Anophelines
   mosquito only, suggesting its genus specific role. SOCS mRNA is
   expressed in all developmental stages of mosquito and its expression is
   higher in male than female adults. SOCS mRNA is significantly induced
   after Plasmodium infection in midgut tissue indicating its involvement
   in the immune defense responses. This is the first evidence of
   involvement of SOCS as an immune gene in Indian malaria vector An.

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal dynamics of mosquitoes in stream pools were
   examined in a biosphere reserve of the Southern Western Ghats, India.
   The immature mosquitoes in stream pools were collected from stream
   substrates of bedrock pool, boulder cavity and sand puddle. The
   collected larvae and pupae were reared and identified. In total, 16
   species from four genera of mosquitoes were collected. The mosquito
   species from Culex and Anopheles were predominantly occurred. The
   bedrock pool had the highest diversity and abundance of mosquitoes. The
   statistical analyses showed that the substrate specificity and the
   seasons were positively related to the distribution of mosquitoes rather
   than spatial pattern. This study described the spatial and temporal
   pattern of mosquitoes in stream pools of the Southern Western Ghats.

Title = {{Is there malaria transmission in urban settings in Colombia?}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Colombia contributes a significant proportion of malaria
   cases in the Americas, which are predominantly rural. However, in the
   last 8 years similar to 10 \% of the endemic municipalities have also
   reported urban and periurban malaria cases, a growing concern for health
   authorities. This study focused on the characterization of the
   officially reported urban malaria cases.
   Methods: A descriptive retrospective study based on secondary
   information provided by the Colombian National Surveillance
   System-SIVIGILA for the 2008-2012 period was conducted. A total of 17
   municipalities with consistent and persistent reports of urban and
   peri-urban malaria were selected for analysis, which included site of
   origin and of residence, age, gender and ethnicity of patients, health
   system affiliation, Plasmodium species and the presence of malaria
   vectors.
   Results: A total of 18,113 malaria cases were reported from urban and
   peri-urban areas of 17 endemic municipalities. Almost 70 \% of the
   reports originated in localities in the departments of Choco and NariNo,
   located on the Pacific Coast where a predominantly Afro-Colombian
   population, of individuals of under 30 years of age, was the most
   affected (80.7 \%), mainly with Plasmodium falciparum infections (52.1
   \%). Median annual parasite index (API) was 6.4 per 1000 inhabitants
   (3.4 in 2008; 10.8 in 2010 and 6.0 in 2012). Between 2011 and 2012
   complicated cases (2.4 \%) and malaria in pregnant women (1.4 \%) were
   reported. Study areas reported the presence of at least seven Anopheles
   species considered malaria vectors. These analyses did not allow
   ascertaining the presumable origin of the recorded urban cases due to
   the lack of a consensus on a definition of urban, peri-urban and rural
   limits and the lack of proper verification of the geographical source of
   infection.
   Conclusions: The study indicates the probable presence of endemic,
   unstable and low-intensity malaria transmission in Colombian urban and
   peri-urban areas of a group of municipalities located mainly on the
   Pacific coast region and a few others in the eastern region. There is a
   need to unequivocally confirm the urban or peri-urban origin of the
   malaria cases reported and the transmission conditions, as well as to
   develop and implement new strategies for urban and peri-urban malaria
   control and elimination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles fluviatilis exists as a complex of sibling species
   S, T, U and V exhibiting distinct variations. Sibling species S is
   considered as the main vector and anthropogenic whereas T, U and V are
   zoophagic nonvectors. This study was performed in a forested village of
   Keonjhar district, Odisha to identify the status of An. fluviatilis
   sibling species.
   Methods: Mosquito collections were made from cattle sheds (CS), human
   dwellings (HD) and mixed dwellings (MD) from June 2012 to May 2013. The
   proportion of An. fluviatilis collected from different habitats was
   compared with An. culicifacies. PCR assays were conducted to reveal
   their sibling species composition, host preference and sporozoite rate.
   Results: Anopheles fluviatilis was the dominant species followed by An.
   culicifacies. The relative proportion of collection was high in MD and
   HD for An. fluviatilis and An. culicifacies respectively. PCR assay
   confirmed 9.4\% S and 75.5\% T. Mean collection of sibling species T and
   S were significantly high in MD and HD. Human blood index (HBI) of 0.88
   and 0.61 was confirmed for sibling species S and T respectively with
   13\% sporozoite rate for S.
   Conclusions: High density of the sibling T was found in the study site

Abstract = {{Introduction: Malaria is a protozoa disease caused by the infection of
   red blood cells with the parasites of genus plasmodium and transmitted
   to man by certain species of female anopheles mosquitoes or by blood
   transfusion. There are two types of plasmodium genus are common in
   India. One is p. vivax and p. falciparam.
   Aims and Objectives: 1) To study various clinical manifestations and
   complications of p. vivax malaria during pregnancy. 2) To study morbid
   effect of p. vivax malaria on pregnancy. 3) To study differences of
   clinical manifestations between p. vivax and mixed malarial fever.
   Material and Methods: The study was carried out on 50 patients who were
   admitted in our institute. Written consent for participating in this
   study was taken of all patients. All patients were informed and
   explained about the study. Detailed history, clinical examinations,
   laboratory investigations and treatment given of all patients were
   collected. All patients are followed up to postpartum period to observe
   its postpartum complications.

Title = {{Absence of asymptomatic malaria in a cohort of 133 individuals in a
   malaria endemic area of Assam, India}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria in northeast India affects children and adults
   annually. The number of malaria cases reported has declined over the
   past few years. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether there is an actual
   decline in parasitaemia or whether asymptomatic malaria infections are
   on the rise, especially in forested and forest-fringed areas.
   Asymptomatic malaria forms a parasite reservoir that acts as an
   epicentre for malaria spread during high-transmission season. Therefore
   it is important to understand the quantum of asymptomatic malaria
   infections among the vulnerable population.
   Method: Four forest fringed historically malaria endemic villages were
   selected for the study. A total of 133 individuals without a fever
   history in the past four weeks were tested for malaria parasite using
   rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy and polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) assay during January - February 2014. Indoor resting Anopheles
   vectors were collected, identified and tested for sporozoite using
   VectorTest (TM) panel assay during October 2013 to March 2014, which is
   a low transmission season for malaria. Social and demographic data were
   recorded during the study.
   Results: Mean age (+/- SEM) of the participants was 16.1 +/- 1.2 years
   (95 \% CI: 13.8-18.4). All participants (100 \%) reported to use
   mosquito nets. Altogether, 43.6 \% of participants had education below
   primary level and only 9 \% reported a travel history during the past
   four weeks. All RDT, microscopy and PCR assays were found negative
   indicating no asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia. Seven known malaria
   vector species namely, Anopheles nivipes, An. minimus, An. annularis,
   An. vagus, An. aconitus, An. philippinensis and An. culicifacies, were
   recorded in the present study. VectorTest T sporozoite panel assay
   conducted on 45 pools (N=224) of vector mosquitoes were found negative
   for Plasmodium sporozoite.
   Discussion: Northeastern states of India report asymptomatic malaria
   parasitemia along with high malaria transmission. An. minimus and An.
   dirus are recognised as efficient vectors, but An. culicifacies, An.
   philippinensis and An. annularis also play role in malaria transmission.
   Currently all participants were found negative for asymptomatic malaria,
   however the small sample size may restrict the scope of present results
   to the population living in more remote areas.
   Conclusion: No cases of asymptomatic malaria infections parasitaemia was
   found in the present study conducted during a low transmission season
   indicating that asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia may not be prevalent
   in the region. Mosquito specimens were tested negative for the malaria
   sporozoites. Study findings encourage the ongoing malaria intervention
   efforts and recommends similar investigations in different ecological
   areas involving large populations.}},

Abstract = {{Background objectives: Jharkhand is one of the highly malaria endemic
   states in India and experiencing vast ecological and human-induced
   changes over the years. These changes have provided more favourable
   conditions for malaria transmission in the region. The present study was
   carried out to find out the distribution and prevalence of anopheline
   vector and non-vector species in District Ramgarh of Jharkhand state.
   Methods: Daytime indoor resting adult female anopheline mosquitoes were
   collected from four subcentres comprising of eight study villages in
   District Ramgarh. The collections were made from fixed as well as random
   human dwellings and cattlesheds on fortnightly basis using manual
   aspiration method from January to December 2012. Mosquito identification
   was done by using standard identification keys. Results: A total of
   18,875 anophelines belonging to 19 species were collected. Of these,
   61.87\% were vector species (An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An.
   annularis). Of total vector collection, 57.44\% was observed in Gola
   block and 42.55\% in Ramgarh. An. culicifacies was predominant species
   followed by An. fluviatilis and An. annularis in the study area. Out of
   19, eight anopheline species exhibited successional changes in their
   composition over the period of years. Statistical analysis revealed
   positive correlation between meteorological variables and man hour
   density in case of An. culicifacies, whereas these were negatively
   correlated in case of An. fluviatilis and An. annularis. Interpretation
   conclusion: The study revealed the prevalence of three recognised
   malaria vector species (An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and An.
   annularis) in high density throughout the year in this area, which
   indicates possibility of widening of malaria transmission window in the
   presence of malaria parasites. The shifting of anopheline species in
   Ramgarh also indicate alteration in ecological, environmental and
   sociological conditions, which necessitate routine monitoring on ecology
   and successional changes of vector species as well as malariological
   survey for management and adoption of appropriate vector control
   strategies in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Background objectives: Filariasis is one of the major vector-borne
   diseases causing serious health problem in the tropics and subtropics.
   The coastal areas of Digha are known to be a filariasis prone region of
   West Bengal, India. The filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti is
   transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus, the established filarial vector
   in West Bengal, India. The present work was aimed to determine the
   abundance of different mosquito species; and the frequency, distribution
   and blood meal analysis of Cx. quinquefasciatus in coastal areas of
   Digha. Methods: During the present study, a total of 11,537 mosquitoes
   {[}Cx. quinquefasciatus, Armigeres subalbatus, Anopheles barbirostris,
   An. annularis, An. subpictus, An. sundaicus, Aedes albopictus, and Cx.
   vishnui (group)] were collected by hand collection method from human
   habitations and cattlesheds of 10 villages of Digha, West Bengal, India.
   The seasonal prevalence of Cx. quinquefasciatus was studied. In each
   season, blood meals of 300 Cx. quinquefasciatus collected from human
   habitations were analysed during the study period. Results: Cx.
   quinquefasciatus was found to be the dominant species (88.44\% of the
   total collection) in the study area. It was most frequently found in and
   around human habitations than cattlesheds. Total man hour density
   calculation revealed that this species was most prevalent during the
   rainy season. Two-way ANOVA revealed that the abundance of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus varied with different seasons. Blood meal analysis
   showed that the filarial vector preferred human blood than that of other
   animals. Interpretation conclusion: This study suggested Cx.
   quinquefasciatus as the dominant mosquito species in the study area; and
   the anthropophilic nature of Cx. quinquefasciatus might be the reason of
   increase in the intensity of filarial transmission in coastal areas of
   Digha.}},

Abstract = {{Scale-up of the main vector control interventions, residual insecticides
   sprayed on walls or structures and/or impregnated in bed nets, together
   with prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, have led to a global
   reduction in malaria transmission. However, resistance in vectors to
   almost all classes of insecticides, particularly to the synthetic
   pyrethroids, is posing a challenge to the recent trend of declining
   malaria. Ten International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research
   (ICEMR) located in the most malaria-endemic regions of the world are
   currently addressing insecticide resistance in the main vector
   populations, which not only threaten hope for elimination in
   malaria-endemic countries but also may lead to reversal where notable
   reductions in malaria have been documented. This communication
   illustrates the current status of insecticide resistance with a focus on
   the countries where activities are ongoing for 9 out of the 10 ICEMRs.
   Most of the primary malaria vectors in the ICEMR countries exhibit
   insecticide resistance, albeit of varying magnitude, and spanning all
   mechanisms of resistance. New alternatives to the insecticides currently
   available are still to be fully developed for deployment. Integrated
   vector management principles need to be better understood and
   encouraged, and viable insecticide resistance management strategies need
   to be developed and implemented.}},

Abstract = {{A major public health question is whether urbanization will transform
   malaria from a rural to an urban disease. However, differences about
   definitions of urban settings, urban malaria, and whether malaria
   control should differ between rural and urban areas complicate both the
   analysis of available data and the development of intervention
   strategies. This report examines the approach of the International
   Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) to urban malaria in
   Brazil, Colombia, India (Chennai and Goa), Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda.
   Its major theme is the need to determine whether cases diagnosed in
   urban areas were imported from surrounding rural areas or resulted from
   transmission within the urban area. If infections are being acquired
   within urban areas, malaria control measures must be targeted within
   those urban areas to be effective. Conversely, if malaria cases are
   being imported from rural areas, control measures must be directed at
   vectors, breeding sites, and infected humans in those rural areas.
   Similar interventions must be directed differently if infections were
   acquired within urban areas. The hypothesis underlying the ICEMR
   approach to urban malaria is that optimal control of urban malaria
   depends on accurate epidemiologic and entomologic information about
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide resistance poses a serious problem for worldwide mosquito
   control programs. Resistance to insecticides can be caused by an
   increased metabolic detoxification of the insecticide and/or by target
   site insensitivity. In the present study, we estimated the tolerance of
   Indian Aedes aegypti populations using adult bioassays that revealed
   high resistance levels of the field populations to permethrin (RR-6, 5.8
   and 5.1 folds) compared to our susceptible population. Enzymatic assays
   revealed increased activities of glutathione S-transferase and
   carboxylesterase enzymes in the field populations comparatively to the
   susceptible population. PBO synergist assays did not confirm that
   cytochrome P450 monooxygenase metabolic detoxification acted as a major
   cause of resistance. Hence the role of target site resistance was
   therefore investigated. A single substitution Phe1534Cys in the voltage
   gated sodium channel was found in domain III, segment 6 (III-S6) of the
   resistance populations (allele frequency=0.59, 0.51 and 0.47) suggesting
   its potential role in permethrin resistance in A. aegypti. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{ObjectivesIndia is the most malaria-endemic country in South-East Asia,
   resulting in a high socio-economic burden. Insecticide-treated or
   untreated nets are effective interventions to prevent malaria. As part
   of an Indian first-aid guideline project, we aimed to investigate the
   magnitude of this effect in India.
   MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase and Central to systematically review
   Indian studies on the effectiveness of treated or untreated vs. no nets.
   Parasite prevalence and annual parasite incidence served as malaria
   outcomes. The overall effect was investigated by performing
   meta-analyses and calculating the pooled risk ratios (RR) and incidence
   rate ratios.
   ResultsOf 479 articles, we finally retained 16 Indian studies. Untreated
   nets decreased the risk of parasite prevalence compared to no nets {[}RR
   0.69 (95\% CI; 0.55, 0.87) in high-endemic areas, RR 0.49 (95\% CI;
   0.28, 0.84) in low-endemic areas], as was the case but more pronounced
   for treated nets {[}RR 0.35 (95\% CI; 0.26, 0.47) in high-endemic areas,
   risk ratio 0.16 (95\% CI; 0.06, 0.44) in low-endemic areas]. Incidence
   rate ratios showed a similar observation: a significantly reduced rate
   of parasites in the blood for untreated nets vs. no nets, which was more
   pronounced in low-endemic areas and for those who used treated nets. The
   average effect of treated nets (vs. no nets) on parasite prevalence was
   higher in Indian studies (RR 0.16-0.35) than in non-Indian studies (data
   derived from a Cochrane systematic review; RR 0.58-0.87).
   ConclusionsBoth treated and untreated nets have a clear protective
   effect against malaria in the Indian context. This effect is more
   pronounced there than in other countries.
   Objectifsl'Inde est le pays le plus endemique pour le paludisme en Asie
   du sud-est, ce qui entraine une charge socioeconomique elevee. Les
   moustiquaires impregnees ou non d'insecticide sont des interventions
   efficaces pour prevenir le paludisme. Dans le cadre d'un projet de
   directive de secourisme Indien, nous avons cherche a investiguer sur
   l'ampleur de cet effet en Inde.
   MethodesNous avons recherche dans MEDLINE, Embase et Centrale afin
   d'analyser systematiquement les etudes indiennes sur l'efficacite des
   moustiquaires traitees ou non traitees par rapport a l'absence de
   moustiquaires. La prevalence du parasite et l'incidence annuelle du
   parasite ont servi de resultats pour l'analyse. L'effet global a ete
   etudie en effectuant des meta-analyses et en calculant les rapports de
   risque (RR) pooles et les rapports des taux d'incidence.
   ResultatsSur 479 articles, nous avons finalement retenu 16 etudes
   indiennes. Les moustiquaires non traitees ont diminue le risque de
   prevalence du parasite compare a l'absence de moustiquaires (RR: 0,69
   {[}IC 95\%]; 0,55-0,87 dans les zones de forte endemie, RR: 0,49
   {[}IC95\%; 0,28-0,84] dans les zones de faible endemie), comme c'etait
   le cas aussi mais de facon plus prononcee pour les moustiquaires
   traitees (RR: 0,35 {[}IC95\%]; 0,26-0,47 dans les zones de forte endemie
   et RR:0,16 {[}IC95\%]; 0,06-0,44 dans les zones de faible endemie). Les
   rapports des taux d'incidence ont donne une observation similaire; un
   taux significativement reduit de parasites dans le sang pour les
   moustiquaires non traitees par rapport a l'absence de moustiquaires, qui
   etait plus prononce dans les zones de faible endemie et pour ceux qui
   ont utilise des moustiquaires traitees. L'effet moyen des moustiquaires
   impregnees (par rapport a l'absence de moustiquaires) sur la prevalence
   du parasite etait plus eleve dans les etudes indiennes (RR: 0,16-0,35)
   que dans les etudes non indiennes (donnees derivees d'une revue
   systematique de Cochrane; RR: 0,58-0,87).
   ConclusionsLes moustiquaires traites et non traitees ont un effet
   protecteur clair contre le paludisme dans le contexte indien. Cet effet
   est plus prononce que dans d'autres pays.
   ObjetivosIndia es el pais con mayor endemicidad para malaria en el

   efectividad de las redes mosquiteras tratadas versus las no tratadas. La
   prevalencia de parasitos y la incidencia anual de parasitos servian como
   resultados de malaria. El efecto general fue evaluado mediante un
   meta-analisis y se calcularon el cociente de riesgos agrupado (RR) y la
   razon de densidades de incidencia (RDI)
   ResultadosDe 479 articulos, se escogieron 16 estudios hindues. Las
   mosquiteras no impregnadas disminuian el riesgo de prevalencia
   parasitaria al compararlas con no utilizar ninguna mosquitera (RR 0.69
   {[}IC95\%; 0.55,0.87] en areas altamente endemicas, RR 0.49 {[}IC95\%;
   0.28,0.84] en areas con baja endemicidad), como era tambien el caso para
   las mosquiteras impregnadas, pero con un efecto aun mas pronunciado (RR
   0.35 {[}95\%CI; 0.26,0.47] en areas altamente endemicas, RR 0.16 {[}IC
   95\%; 0.06,0.44] en areas de baja endemicidad. Con las RDI se observaba
   una tendencia similar: una tasa significativamente reducida de parasitos
   en sangre para el uso de mosquiteras sin tratar vs. no utilizar
   mosquiteras, lo cual era mas pronunciado en areas de baja endemicidad
   asi como para aquellos que utilizaban mosquiteras impregnadas. El efecto
   promedio de utilizar mosquiteras impregnadas (versus no utilizar
   mosquitera) sobre la prevalencia de parasitos era mayor en estudios de
   la India (RR 0.16-0.35) que en estudios fuera de la India (datos
   derivados de una revision sistematica de Cochrane; RR 0.58-0.87).
   ConclusionesTanto las mosquiteras impregnadas como las no impregnadas
   tienen un efecto protector claro frente a la malaria en el contexto de
   la India. Este efecto es mas pronunciado que en otros paises.}},

Title = {{Design of a study to determine the impact of insecticide resistance on
   malaria vector control: a multi-country investigation}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Progress in reducing the malaria disease burden through the
   substantial scale up of insecticide-based vector control in recent years
   could be reversed by the widespread emergence of insecticide resistance.
   The impact of insecticide resistance on the protective effectiveness of
   insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) is not
   known. A multi-country study was undertaken in Sudan, Kenya, India,
   Cameroon and Benin to quantify the potential loss of epidemiological
   effectiveness of ITNs and IRS due to decreased susceptibility of malaria
   vectors to insecticides. The design of the study is described in this
   paper.
   Methods: Malaria disease incidence rates by active case detection in
   cohorts of children, and indicators of insecticide resistance in local
   vectors were monitored in each of approximately 300 separate locations
   (clusters) with high coverage of malaria vector control over multiple
   malaria seasons. Phenotypic and genotypic resistance was assessed
   annually. In two countries, Sudan and India, clusters were randomly
   assigned to receive universal coverage of ITNs only, or universal
   coverage of ITNs combined with high coverage of IRS. Association between
   malaria incidence and insecticide resistance, and protective
   effectiveness of vector control methods and insecticide resistance were
   estimated, respectively.
   Results: Cohorts have been set up in all five countries, and phenotypic
   resistance data have been collected in all clusters. In Sudan, Kenya,
   Cameroon and Benin data collection is due to be completed in 2015. In
   India data collection will be completed in 2016.
   Discussion: The paper discusses challenges faced in the design and
   execution of the study, the analysis plan, the strengths and weaknesses,
   and the possible alternatives to the chosen study design.}},

Abstract = {{This meeting report presents the outcomes of a workshop held in Bangkok
   on December 1st 2014, where the following challenges were discussed: the
   threat of resistance to artemisinin and artemisinin-based combination
   therapy in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) and in Africa; access to
   treatment for most at risk and hard to reach population; insecticide
   resistance, residual and outdoors transmission. The role of operational
   research and the interactions between research institutions, National
   Malaria Control Programmes, Civil Society Organizations, and of
   financial and technical partners to address those challenges and to
   accelerate translation of research into policies and programmes were
   debated. The threat and the emergency of the artemisinin resistance
   spread and independent emergence in the GMS was intensely debated as it
   is now close to the border of India. The need for key messages, based on
   scientific evidence and information available and disseminated without
   delay, was highlighted as crucial for an effective and urgent response.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths
   every year. The use of synthetic insecticides to control vector
   mosquitoes has caused physiological resistance and adverse environmental
   effects in addition to high operational cost. Insecticides synthesized
   of natural products for vector control have been a priority in this
   area. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were
   green-synthesized using a floral extract of Chrysanthemum indicum
   screened for larvicidal and pupicidal activity against the first to
   fourth instar larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi
   mosquitoes. The synthesized Ag NPs were characterized by using UV-vis
   absorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The textures of the
   yielded Ag NPs were found to be spherical and polydispersed with a mean
   size in the range of 25-59 nm. Larvae and pupae were exposed to various
   concentrations of aqueous extract of C. indicum and synthesized Ag NPs
   for 24 h, and the maximum mortality was observed from the synthesized Ag
   NPs against the vector A. stephensi (LC50=5.07, 10.35, 14.19, 22.81, and
   35.05 ppm; LC90=29.18, 47.15, 65.53, 87.96, and 115.05 ppm). These
   results suggest that the synthesized Ag NPs have the potential to be
   used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of A. stephensi.
   Additionally, this study provides the larvicidal and pupicidal
   properties of green-synthesized Ag NPs with the floral extract of C.
   indicum against vector mosquito species from the geographical location
   of India.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDOX513A is a genetically engineered strain of Aedes aegypti
   carrying a repressible, dominantly inherited transgene that confers
   lethality in immature heterozygous progeny. Released male OX513A adults
   have proven to be effective for the localised suppression of wild Ae.
   aegypti, highlighting its potential in vector control. Mating and
   life-table assessments were used to compare OX513A with reared Ae.
   aegypti strains collected from New Delhi and Aurangabad regions in
   India.
   RESULTSMating proportions of New Delhi females versus males of OX513A or
   New Delhi strains were 0.52 and 0.48 respectively, indicating no
   discrimination by females against either strain, and males of both
   strains were equally competitive. Developmental time from first instar
   to adult emergence was significantly longer for OX513A (10.7 0.04 days)
   than for New Delhi (9.4 +/- 0.04 days) and Aurangabad strains (9.1 +/-
   0.04 days). Differences in mean longevities, female reproductive
   parameters and population growth parameters between the strains were
   non-significant.
   CONCLUSIONS<p id={''}ps3873-para-0003{''}>The laboratory study
   demonstrates that only minor life-table variations of limited biological
   relevance exist between OX513A and Indian Ae. aegypti populations, and
   males had equal potential for mating competitiveness. Thus, results
   support the OX513A strain as a suitable candidate for continued
   evaluation towards sustainable management of Ae. aegypti populations in
   India. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

   and malaria disease in district of Visakhapatnam, India to understand
   malaria transmission mechanism (MTM).
   Methodology
   Epidemiological, vector and climate data were analysed for the years
   2005 to 2011 in Visakhapatnam to understand the magnitude, trends and
   seasonal patterns of the malarial disease. Statistical software MINITAB
   ver. 14 was used for performing correlation, linear and multiple
   regression analysis.
   Results/Findings
   Perennial malaria disease incidence and mosquito population was observed
   in the district of Visakhapatnam with peaks in seasons. All the climatic
   variables have a significant influence on disease incidence as well as
   on mosquito populations. Correlation coefficient analysis, seasonal
   index and seasonal analysis demonstrated significant relationships among
   climatic factors, mosquito population and malaria disease incidence in
   the district of Visakhapatnam, India. Multiple regression and ARIMA (I)
   models are best suited models for modeling and prediction of disease
   incidences and mosquito population. Predicted values of average
   temperature, mosquito population and malarial cases increased along with
   the year. Developed MTM algorithm observed a major MTM cycle following
   the June to August rains and occurring between June to September and
   minor MTM cycles following March to April rains and occurring between
   March to April in the district of Visakhapatnam. Fluctuations in
   climatic factors favored an increase in mosquito populations and thereby
   increasing the number of malarial cases. Rainfall, temperatures (20
   degrees C to 33 degrees C) and humidity (66\% to 81\%) maintained a
   warmer, wetter climate for mosquito growth, parasite development and
   malaria transmission.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Changes in climatic factors influence malaria directly by modifying the
   behaviour and geographical distribution of vectors and by changing the
   length of the life cycle of the parasite.}},

Title = {{Knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in Indian Anopheles culicifacies
   populations}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the primary vectors of
   malaria in India responsible for the highest number of malaria cases.
   This vector is resistant to DDT in most parts of the country with
   indication of emerging resistance to pyrethroids. Since knockdown
   resistance (kdr) is known to confer cross-resistance between DDT and
   pyrethroids owing to a common target site of action, knowledge of
   prevalence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles is important from
   insecticide resistance management point of view.
   Methods: Nine populations of An. culicifacies belonging to five states
   of India, representing northern, western and central-east India, were
   screened for the presence of two alternative kdr mutations L1014F and
   L1014S using PCR-based assays. Dead and alive mosquitoes, following WHO
   standard insecticide susceptibility test against deltamethrin and DDT,
   were tested for allelic association.
   Results: L1014F mutation was recorded in all populations studied except
   from Haryana and Rajasthan states in northern India, with low
   frequencies ranging between 0.012 and 0.076; whereas presence of L1014S
   mutation was recorded in five populations only belonging to central-east
   India, with allelic frequencies ranging between 0.010 and 0.046. Both
   the kdr mutant alleles were found mostly in heterozygous condition
   without deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Both mutations showed
   protection against deltamethrin whereas only L1014S mutation showed
   protection against DDT when tested using additive model.
   Conclusions: The two L1014-kdr mutations, L1014F and L1014S, co-occurred
   in five populations belonging to Chhattisgarh and Odisha states of India
   whereas L1014F was present in all populations studied except populations
   from northern states. Both kdr mutations were found with very low
   allelic frequencies mostly in heterozygous condition and exhibited
   protection against deltamethrin.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The most part of Iran become malaria-free region and fall in
   prevention of re-introduction stage. These regions however are
   struggling with imported of malaria cases where malaria vectors exist.
   Therefore, understanding the situation of mosquito vectors is crucial.
   This study was carried out to find out the present situation of malaria
   vectors and malaria transmission potential in a malaria-free area.
   Methods: The study was conducted in a malaria free area, Izeh County,
   Khuzestan Province during 12 months in 2011-2012. Five villages,
   including 2 in highlands and 3 in plain area, were selected randomly.
   The mosquito sampling methods were conducted using spray sheet and hand
   catch collection methods from indoor/outdoors, window trap and larvae
   collections.
   Results: In total, 3352 female Anopheles were captured, 1826 mosquito
   from highland and 1526 from plain areas. Five species, An. stephensi,
   An. fluviatilis s.l., An. dthali, An. superpictus and An. pulcherrimus
   were identified. The seasonal activities were started from April to
   March. The abdominal conditions of collected mosquitoes from
   indoor/outdoor places pointed to exophilic propensity of An.
   fluviatilis.l. s.l. and endophilic behaviour for rest of the vectors.
   The results of window trap also confirmed these behaviors. The larval
   habitats of four species were widely dispersed and included spring,
   margin of rivers, irrigation channels, stagnant water and rice filed.
   Conclusion: Understanding the present situation of malaria vectors in
   free-malaria area is crucial particularly where is struggling with
   imported cases. The results of present study can be expanded to other
   area of northern Khuzestan for malaria vector control planning in
   reintroduction prevention stage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles stephensi is a sub-tropical species and has been
   considered as one of the most important vector of human malaria
   throughout the Middle East and South Asian region including the
   malarious areas of southern Iran. Current reports confirmed An.
   stephensi resistance to temephos in Oman and India. However, there is no
   comprehensive research on mechanisms of temephos resistance in An.
   stephensi in the literature. This study was designed in order to clarify
   the enzymatic and molecular mechanisms of temephos resistance in this
   species.
   Methods: Profile activities of alpha- and beta-esterases, mixed function
   oxidase (MFO), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), insensitive
   acetylcholinesterase, and para-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA)-esterase
   enzymes were tested for An. stephensi strain with resistance ratio of
   15.82 to temephos in comparison with susceptible strain.
   Results: Results showed that the mean activity of alpha-EST, GST and
   AChE enzymes were classified as altered indicating metabolic mechanisms
   have considerable role in resistance of An. stephensi to temephos.
   Molecular study using PCR-RFLP method to trace the G119S mutation in
   ACE-1 gene showed lack of the mutation responsible for organophosphate
   insecticide resistance in the temephos-selected strain of An. stephensi.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the altered enzymes but not targets
   site insensitivity of ACE-1 are responsible for temephos resistance in
   An. stephensi in south of Iran.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with different formulations
   of insecticides is being used for the control of mosquito vectors in
   many countries. In the present study, residual efficacy and duration of
   effectiveness of IRS with alpha-cypermethrin WG-SB (250 g AI/m(2))
   formulation was compared with WP formulation (50 g AI/kg) in a small
   scale (Phase II) field trial.
   Methods: Two dosages, i.e. 20 and 30 mg AI/m(2), were used and the
   efficacy and duration of effectiveness was assessed on
   alpha-cypermethrin susceptible population of Anopheles stephensi. Four
   types of surfaces were selected, namely cement wall with distemper
   coating, cement wall with lime coating, mud wall with lime coating, and
   brick wall unpainted. Spraying was carried out with Hudson sprayer
   fitted with control flow valve. Bioassays were carried out at weekly and
   then fortnightly intervals. Chemical analysis of filter paper samples
   collected from the sprayed surfaces was done at Walloon Agricultural
   Research Institute, Gembloux, Belgium.
   Results: Alpha-cypermethrin WG-SB showed residual efficacy (>80 \%
   mortality) for 13-15 weeks for the 20 mg/m(2) dosage and 13-16 weeks for
   the 30 mg/m(2) dosage, whereas alpha-cypermethrin WP showed residual
   efficacy for 11-15 weeks for the 20 mg/m(2) dosage and 11-14 weeks for
   the 30 mg/m(2) dosage on the surfaces tested. The average of the applied
   to target dose ratio ranged from 0.89 to 1.17 for alpha-cypermethrin
   WG-SB at 20 mg AI/m(2), 0.83-1.80 for the WG-SB at 30 mg AI/m(2),
   0.87-1.66 for alpha-cypermethrin WP at 20 mg AI/m(2), and 0.68-1.06 for
   WP at 30 mg AI/m(2). No adverse events were reported, either by the
   spray men or the household inhabitants, during and after the spray
   operations.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the dose of WG 30 mg/m(2) gave
   slightly longer effective residual action against malaria vector (16
   weeks) on most common indoor surfaces and could be used for effective
   control of Anopheles mosquitoes. The WG formulation was found to be easy
   to handle, no smell was reported during the spraying and was found to be
   operationally acceptable for indoor residual spraying.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   This study was undertaken in two Primary Health Centers (PHCs) of
   malaria endemic district Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh (Central India).
   Methods
   In this study we had investigated the relative frequencies of the
   different anopheline species collected within the study areas by using
   indoor resting catches, CDC light trap and human landing methods.
   Sibling species of malaria vectors were identified by cytogenetic and
   molecular techniques. The role of each vector and its sibling species in
   the transmission of the different Plasmodium species was ascertained by
   using sporozoite ELISA.
   Results
   A total of 52,857 specimens comprising of 17 anopheline species were
   collected by three different methods (39,964 by indoor resting
   collections, 1059 by human landing and 11,834 by CDC light trap).
   Anopheles culicifacies was most predominant species in all collections
   (55, 71 and 32\% in indoor resting, human landing and light trap
   collections respectively) followed by An. subpictus and An. annularis.
   All five sibling species of An. culicifacies viz. species A, B, C, D and
   E were found while only species T and S of An. fluviatilis were
   collected. The overall sporozoite rate in An. culicifacies and An.
   fluviatilis were 0.42\% (0.25\% for P. falciparum and 0.17\% for P.
   vivax) and 0.90\% (0.45\% for P. falciparum and 0.45\% for P. vivax)
   respectively. An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were found harbouring
   both P. vivax variants VK-210 and VK-247, and P. falciparum. An.
   culicifacies sibling species C and D were incriminated as vectors during
   most part of the year while sibling species T of An. fluviatilis was
   identified as potential vector in monsoon and post monsoon season.
   Conclusions
   An. culicifacies species C (59\%) was the most abundant species followed
   by An. culicifacies D (24\%), B (8.7\%), E (6.7\%) and A (1.5\%). Among
   An. fluviatilis sibling species, species T was common (99\%) and only
   few specimens of S were found. Our study provides crucial information on
   the prevalence of An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis sibling species
   and their potential in malaria transmission which will assist in
   developing strategic control measures against these vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria epidemiology is complex due to multiplicity of disease vectors,
   sibling species complex and variations in bionomical characteristics,
   vast varied terrain, various ecological determinants. There are six
   major mosquito vector taxa in India, viz. Anopheles culicifacies, An.
   fluviatilis, An. stephensi, An. minimus, An. dirus and An. sundaicus.
   Among these, An. culicifacies is widely distributed and considered the
   most important vector throughout the plains and forests of India for
   generating bulk of malaria cases (> 60\% annually). Major malaria
   epidemics are caused by An. culicifaices. It is also the vector of
   tribal malaria except parts of Odisha and Northeastern States of India.
   An. culicifacies has been the cause of perennial malaria transmission in
   forests, and over the years penetrated the deforested areas of
   Northeast. An. culicifacies participates in malaria transmission either
   alone or along with An. stephensi or An. fluviatilis. The National
   Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) spends about 80 per cent
   malaria control budget annually in the control of An. culicifacies, yet
   it remains one of the most formidable challenges in India. With recent
   advances in molecular biology there has been a significant added
   knowledge in understanding the biology, ecology, genetics and response
   to interventions, requiring stratification for cost-effective and
   sustainable malaria control. Research leading to newer interventions
   that are evidence-based, community oriented and sustainable would be
   useful in tackling the emerging challenges in malaria control. Current
   priority areas of research should include in-depth vector biology and
   control in problem pockets, preparation of malaria-risk maps for focused
   and selective interventions, monitoring insecticide resistance,
   cross-border initiative and data sharing, and coordinated control
   efforts for achieving transmission reduction, and control of
   drug-resistant malaria. The present review on An. culicifacies provides
   updated information on vector biology and control outlining thrust areas
   of research.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: In India, malaria is a major public health
   problem in States having predominantly tribal population. The objective
   of this analysis was to find out the incidence of malaria in various
   States/districts having varied proportions of tribal population using
   National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) data.
   Methods: States and districts were classified into three categories
   based on proportions of Scheduled Tribes (ST) population as < 10,
   10-29.9 and 30 per cent ST population. Five year average (2008-2012) of
   all important malaria indicators collected by NVBDCP was taken to
   normalize the effect of annual fluctuations in malaria incidence.
   Results: State level analysis revealed that ten States/UTs with 30 per
   cent or more tribal population comprising only three per cent of total
   population, contributed 14 per cent of total malaria, 21 per cent
   Plasmodium falciparum and 29 per cent of deaths due to malaria.
   Similarly, district level analysis showed that districts with 30 per
   cent or more tribal population comprising about eight per cent countrys
   population contributed to 46 per cent of total malaria cases, 70 per
   cent P. falciparum and 47 per cent malarial deaths in the country.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Our analysis showed that the neglect of
   the ethnic communities in tribal areas would be detrimental to the
   overall reduction of morbidity and mortality due to malaria. The fight
   against the increasing burden of malaria in tribal belt requires
   adoption of multiple approaches and socio-economic development of the
   tribal communities.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Epidemiology and transmission of malaria vary
   within the tribal areas with the variation in topography, forest cover
   and type of forest. For the control of disease, understanding of the
   dynamics of transmission in the varied ecological situation is
   essential. This study was carried out in the two distinct tribal areas-
   Baiga Chak (thick forested area) of Dindori district and Bichhia block
   (forest fringe area) of Mandla district, Madhya Prasdesh, India, to
   understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of malaria.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected using hand catch and whole night
   collections to determine the proportion of vectors, their density and
   seasonality. Vector incrimination was done by sporozoite ELISA and
   feeding preferences of vector by gel diffusion method. Active fever
   surveys were carried out fortnightly to determine the age specific
   malaria parasite rates among the inhabitants of two areas.
   Results: Density of Anopheles culicifacies was significantly higher in
   Bichhia while the density of An. fluviatilis was higher in Baiga Chak.
   An. culicifacies was incriminated from both the areas while An.
   fluviatilis was incriminated from Baiga Chak only. Malaria slide
   positivity rate (SPR) was significantly higher (OR=3.7 95\%CI, 3.1-4.4)
   in Baiga Chak (28.2\%) than Bichhia (9.6\%).
   Interpretation conclusions: The features of malaria transmission in
   tribal areas differed from those reported in rural or semirural
   population. Site-specific and region-specific studies are required to
   develop appropriate intervention measures to control malaria.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles fluviatilis James is an important malaria vector in India,
   Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran. It has now been recognized as a complex of at
   least four sibling species-S, T, U, and V, among which species T is the
   most widely distributed species throughout India. The taxonomic status
   of these species is confusing owing to controversies prevailing in the
   literature. In addition, chromosomal inversion genotypes, which were
   considered species- diagnostic for An. fluviatilis species T, are
   unreliable due to the existence of polymorphism in some populations. To
   study the genetic diversity at population level, we isolated and
   characterized 20 microsatellite markers from microsatellite-enriched
   genomic DNA library of An. fluviatilis T, of which 18 were polymorphic
   while two were monomorphic. The number of alleles per locus among
   polymorphic markers ranged from 4 to 19, and values for observed and
   expected heterozygosities varied from 0.352 to 0.857 and from 0.575 to
   0.933, respectively. Thirteen markers had cross- cryptic species
   transferability to species S and U of the Fluviatilis Complex. This
   study provides a promising genetic tool for the population genetic
   analyses of An. fluviatilis.}},

Title = {{Role of underappreciated vectors in malaria transmission in an endemic
   region of Bangladesh-India border}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite the efforts of the National Malaria Control
   Programme, malaria remains as an important public health problem in
   Bangladesh, particularly in the south-eastern region bordering India.
   Successful malaria control strategies rely on a detailed understanding
   of the underlying causes of malaria transmission. Here, an entomological
   survey was conducted in a malaria endemic area of Bangladesh bordering
   India to investigate the Anopheles mosquito community and assess their
   Plasmodium infection status.
   Methods: Monthly entomological collections were undertaken from October
   2010 to September 2011 in five villages in the Matiranga sub-district,
   Khagrachari district in Bangladesh, bordering the Indian State of
   Tripura. CDC miniature light traps were placed inside houses to collect
   adult Anopheles mosquitoes. Following morphological and molecular
   identification of the female Anopheles mosquitoes collected, they were
   screened for circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum
   (Pf), Plasmodium vivax-210 (Pv-210) and Plasmodium vivax-247 (Pv-247),
   by ELISA to determine natural infection rates. Variation in Anopheles
   species composition, relative abundance and Plasmodium infection rates
   were analysed between sampled villages.
   Results: A total of 2,027 female Anopheles were collected, belonging to
   20 species. Anopheles nivipes was the most abundant species in our test
   villages during the peak malaria transmission season, and was observed
   sympatrically with An. philippinensis in the studied area. However, in
   the dry off-peak season, An. jeyporiensis was the most abundant species.
   Shannon's diversity index was highest in October (2.12) and evenness was
   highest in May (0.91). The CSP ELISA positive rate overall was 0.44\%.
   Anopheles karwari (n = 2), An. barbirostris s.l. (n = 1) and An. vagus
   (n = 1) were recorded positive for Pf. Anopheles kochi (n = 1) was
   positive for Pv-210 while An. umbrosus (n = 1), An. nivipes (n = 1) and
   An. kochi (n = 1) were positive for Pv-247. A mixed infection of Pf and
   Pv-247 was detected in An. barbirostris s.l.
   Conclusion: High diversity of Anopheles species was observed in areas
   close to the international border where species that were underestimated
   for malaria transmission significantly outnumbered principal vector
   species and these may play a significantly heightened role in malaria
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Vector borne diseases are a threat to human health. Little attention has
   been paid to the prevention of these diseases. We attempted to identify
   the significant wetland characteristics associated with the spread of
   chikungunya, dengue fever and malaria in Kerala, a tropical region of
   South West India using multivariate analyses (hierarchical cluster
   analysis, factor analysis and multiple regression). High/medium turbid
   coastal lagoons and inland water-logged wetlands with aquatic vegetation
   have significant effect on the incidence of chikungunya while dengue
   influenced by high turbid coastal beaches and malaria by medium turbid
   coastal beaches. The high turbidity in water is due to the urban waste
   discharge namely sewage, sullage and garbage from the densely populated
   cities and towns. The large extent of wetland is low land area favours
   the occurrence of vector borne diseases. Hence the provision of
   pollution control measures at source including soil erosion control
   measures is vital. The identification of vulnerable zones favouring the
   vector borne diseases will help the authorities to control pollution
   especially from urban areas and prevent these vector borne diseases.
   Future research should cover land use cover changes, climatic factors,
   seasonal variations in weather and pollution factors favouring the
   occurrence of vector borne diseases.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONTROL}},

Abstract = {{Natural habitat of Romanomermis iyengari, an entomophilic mermithid
   nematode, is rice field. Parasitism of this nematode on mosquito larvae
   breeding in rice fields in Pondicherry, India, has been studied in 1979.
   The present study was to find out its persistence in the same habitat,
   after many years of agricultural practices. Evaluation of parasitism on
   mosquito larvae was carried out during two rice cultivation seasons at a
   schedule of 1 week prior, and 1 and 2 weeks after transplantation of
   paddy. Larval stages of mosquito species such as Culex
   tritaeniorhynchus, Culex vishnui, Anopheles vagus, and Anopheles
   subpictus showed parasitism of R. iyengari. Parasitism was the highest
   on C. tritaeniorhynchus with a maximum of 15.38\% during season I and
   17.85\% during season II. Followed by this, it was on A. vagus (10.82\%
   and 9.43\%), C. vishnui (7.37\% and 8.69\%), and A. subpictus (3.70\%
   and 6.36\%). The overall density of mosquito larvae and level of
   parasitism of R. iyengari on them during season II was significantly
   higher than that of season I. The parasitism was maximum at 1 week
   before transplantation and showed a decreasing trend towards 2 weeks
   after transplantation, during both the seasons. The level of natural
   parasitism of R. iyengari during the present investigation was higher
   than that observed in the same ecosystem almost 35 years ago. This is
   clearly an indication towards the capability of the nematode to
   withstand several years of agricultural practices, including pesticide
   and agrichemical application. Hence, if applied at sufficient level and
   frequency, this nematode could act as a successful biocontrol agent
   against mosquitoes breeding in rice fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The present study was conducted during the years 2006 to 2012 and
   provides information on prevalence of malaria and its regulation with
   effect to various climatic factors in East Siang district of Arunachal
   Pradesh, India. Correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis and
   Hotelling's T-2 statistics models are adopted to understand the effect
   of weather variables on malaria transmission. The epidemiological study
   shows that the prevalence of malaria is mostly caused by the parasite
   Plasmodium vivax followed by Plasmodium falciparum. It is noted that,
   the intensity of malaria cases declined gradually from the year 2006 to
   2012. The transmission of malaria observed was more during the rainy
   season, as compared to summer and winter seasons. Further, the data
   analysis study with Principal Component Analysis and Hotelling's T2
   statistic has revealed that the climatic variables such as temperature
   and rainfall are the most influencing factors for the high rate of
   malaria transmission in East Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh.}},

   Japanese encephalitis. This paper addresses the isolation of new
   mosquitocidal bacteria from soil samples in the Union Territory of

   have been reported. Bacterial isolates from soil samples were screened
   for potential mosquitocidal strains and bioassays against mosquito
   vectors (Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti)
   were carried out. Genomic DNA of potential mosquitocidal isolates was
   amplified and species identification was carried out using BLASTn
   program (NCBI). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of
   mosquitocidal bacteria revealed seven potential isolates. SDS-PAGE
   results have shown that there was considerable difference in the protein
   profiles. Numerical analysis revealed 4 distinct groups at similarity
   level 25\%. The relationship between VBDs and prevalence of soil

Abstract = {{Areas of marginal transmission can generate enormous lethal falciparum
   malaria epidemics when factors favoring the parasite shift only
   slightly. Although usually described in terms of vectorial capacity,
   medical scientists working in India in the early 20th century came to
   the conclusion that ``an epidemic of relapses{''} was the key triggering
   event of malaria epidemics. This explanation has been largely discarded,
   because the biology of Plasmodium falciparum recrudescence has since
   been differentiated from P. vivax relapse. Using data from the Punjab in
   1908 and Ceylon in 1934-1935, the genesis of malaria epidemics has been
   re-examined to inform current control efforts. The epidemics were
   focused geographically depending on recent rainfall or drought.
   Epidemics arose very suddenly and simultaneously in several places.
   Malaria spleen surveys indicated very little recent malaria
   transmission, and blood smears showed very few gametocytes just before
   the epidemic. Population stress as indicated by high grain prices
   because of a poor harvest caused by drought the previous year was a risk
   factor for malaria epidemics. Although increased female Anopheline
   survival because of increased humidity played an important part in the
   magnification of the epidemic, it does not explain its genesis. Human
   population stress triggering a shift toward gametocytogenesis is
   hypothesized as the key initiation factor for malaria epidemics. Its
   evolutionary significance may be that it allows the parasite to match
   the tropical agricultural cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths
   every year. Mosquito control is to enhance the health and quality of
   life of county residents and visitors through the reduction of mosquito
   populations. Mosquito control is a serious concern in developing
   countries like India due to the lack of general awareness, development
   of resistance, and socioeconomic reasons. Today, nanotechnology is a
   promising research domain which has a wide ranging application in vector
   control programs. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable
   prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific
   activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. In the
   present study, larvicidal activity of aqueous leaf extract and silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using C. asiatica plant leaves against
   late third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Cx.
   quinquefasciatus. The range of varying concentrations of synthesized
   AgNPs (8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mu g/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (40, 80,
   120, 160, and 200 mu g/mL) were tested against the larvae of An.
   stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The synthesized AgNPs
   from C. asiatica were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in
   three important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from
   UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis
   (EDX). Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of C.
   asiatica for all three important vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90
   values of C. asiatica aqueous leaf extract appeared to be effective
   against An. stephensi (LC50, 90.17 mu g/mL; LC90, 165.18 mu g/mL)
   followed by Ae. aegypti (LC50, 96.59 mu g/mL; LC90, 173.83 mu g/mL) and
   Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50, 103.08 mu g/mL; LC90, 183.16 mu g/mL).
   Synthesized AgNPs against the vector mosquitoes of An. stephensi, Ae.
   aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90
   values: An. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 17.95 and 33.03 mu
   g/mL; Ae. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 19.32 and 34.87 mu g/mL;
   and Cx. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 20.92 and 37.41 mu
   g/mL. No mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest
   that the leaf aqueous extracts of C. asiatica and green synthesis of
   silver nanoparticles have the potential to be used as an ideal
   eco-friendly approach for the control of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and
   Cx. quinquefasciatus. This is the first report on the mosquito
   larvicidal activity of the plant extracts and synthesized AgNPs.}},

Abstract = {{Acute toxicity tests were carried out to determine the effect of three
   larvicides, spinosad, pirimiphos methyl, and chlorpyrifos, on Culex
   quinquefasciatus Say, Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles (Diptera: Culicidae),
   and guppies, Poecilia reticulata Peters (Pisces: Poeciliidae).
   Thereafter, larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus were introduced to P.
   reticulata in containers of different volumes with low concentrations of
   each larvicide at established predator to prey densities of 1-35; 5-70
   and 10-350 (fish to larvae) respectively. The experiment was replicated
   six times, and the larval consumption was counted after 24 h. Spinosad
   and pirimiphos methyl were significantly toxic to Cx. quinquefasciatus,
   the less susceptible mosquito species. Guppy consumption of Culex larvae
   was highest at a predator to prey density 5-70. Feeding activity of
   guppies increased in the spinosad treatment at 49 mu g L-1 compared to
   control and the synthetic larvicides. The synthetic larvicides generally
   reduced consumption of larvae except for the lowest concentration of
   pirimiphos methyl which increased it at the highest predator to prey
   density in a 3 L container. The highest percentage of Culex larvae was
   consumed by fish in the presence of spinosad at 49 mu g L-1 and a
   predator to prey density of 5-70 in 0.5 L plastic containers. Thus,
   predator to prey density, container size, type and concentration of
   larvicide are all important factors to be considered in integrated

Abstract = {{Malaria and lymphatic filariasis are two of the most common identifiable
   mosquito-borne parasitic diseases worldwide. Mosquito-borne disease is
   believed to be responsible for approximately 1 million deaths per year.
   Such diseases are controlled by use of insecticides; however, these may
   have undesired effects on non-target organisms. We therefore sought a
   suitable larvicidal compound that could replace insecticides by
   evaluating copper(II) complexes for larvicidal activity against
   Anopheles subpictus and Culex quinquefasciatus.
   Larvicidal bioassays were performed with five batches of 20 mosquito
   larvae in 249 mL water and 1.0 mL of complexes of the precursor
   {[}Cu(phen)(L-Thr)(H2O)](ClO4) with semicarbazide, thiosemicarbazide,
   urea or thiourea; the control was dechlorinated tap water. The number of
   dead larvae was counted after 24 h of exposure. Dose response assays
   were performed at concentrations ranging from 10.0 to 0.625 mg/L of the
   complexes. The complex with urea had the best larvicidal activity
   against C. quinquefasciatus and A. subpictus at all concentrations.
   Copper(II) complexes have potential larvicidal activity, and that with
   urea had dose-dependent activity. (C) 2014 Taibah University. Production

   voltage-gated sodium channel, target site of action for
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids, is the most
   common knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation reported in several insects
   conferring resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Here, we report
   presence of two coexisting alternative transversions, A>T and A>C, on
   the third codon position of L1014 residue in malaria vector Anopheles
   subpictus Grassi (species A) from Jamshedpur (India), both leading to
   the same amino acid substitution of Leu-to-Phe with allelic frequencies
   of 19 and 67\%, respectively. A single primer-introduced restriction
   analysis-polymerase chain reaction (PIRA-PCR) was devised for the
   identification of L1014F-kdr mutation in An. subpictus resulting from
   either type of point mutation. Genotyping of samples with PIRA-PCR
   revealed high frequency (82\%) of L1014F-kdr mutation in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{DNA barcoding has gained increased recognition as a molecular tool for
   species identification of insects. Interspecific variation in DNA
   sequences of some genes is much higher than intraspecific and provides
   an opportunity to use DNA sequences for species identification. A study

   species in farming regions of Bengaluru districts in Karnataka state.
   The barcoding of Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of C. anophelis, C.
   palpifer, C. huffi, C. innoxius and C. circumscriptus yielded an
   amplified fragment of 648 bp sequence. Barcode for all 5 species was
   generated using BoldSystems v3 and submitted to genbank for accession

Abstract = {{Recent epidemiological evidences revealed a higher rate of O blood group
   in the residents of malaria-endemic areas suggesting that groups A, B,
   and AB associated with a higher disease severity and fatality. Also
   recent data showed the low prevalence of AB group within the
   malaria-endemic residents in south of Iran and India. The aim of this
   study was to determine the ABO blood groups preference of Anopheles
   stephensi which is the main malaria vector in Iran, southwest Asia, and
   India. An. stephensi mosquitoes were fed either artificially on A/B/O/AB
   membrane blood feeders or directly on human volunteer hands and forearms
   of A/B/O/AB groups in a cage under lab conditions. Phenotype and
   genotype analyzes of 450-blood-fed mosquito specimens using
   agglutination and multiplex-allele-specific PCR revealed a significant
   blood preference of An. stephensi to AB group (40\%) than other groups
   of A (24\%), B (21\%), and O (15\%) in combination of both experiments.
   High preference of An. stephensi to AB group might increase malaria
   infection and fatality in this blood group and resulted in low frequency
   of AB group in the residents of malaria endemic areas. The data
   suggested that malaria vectors, like parasites may have selection
   pressure on human genotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To depict mitochondrial genetic variation for the first time
   among Anopheles minim us (An.minimus) (Diptera: Culicidae) species from
   two malaria endemic states of NE India. Methods: Phylogeographic
   analysis was carried at 9 out of 12 sites of An.minimus confirmed
   malaria endemic places. Results: All sequences were Adenine Thymine rich
   regions. Transitions were observed in 6 sequences where 5 mutations were
   synonymous substitutions and in I case non synonymous mutation was
   observed. Three distinct clusters of haplotypes were generated.
   Haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity were studied. Overall
   negative values obtained from Tajima's D test and Fu'sF(s) test indicate
   a recent genetic population expansion. Network analysis has explained
   sequence diversity that was also shown by mutations in 6 sequences.
   Conclusions: High genetic diversity observed within the populations of
   An.minimus species has several possible implications for vector control
   in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies is an important vector of malaria in
   Southeast Asia, contributing to almost 70\% of malaria cases in India.
   It exists as a complex of five morphologically indistinguishable species
   A, B, C, D and E with varied geographical distribution patterns. In
   India, 8\% of the total population of Madhya Pradesh ( Central India)
   contributes about 30\% of total malaria cases, 60\% of total falciparum
   cases and 50\% of malaria deaths. An. culicifacies is the major malaria
   vector in this state. Vector control mainly relies on the proper
   identification and distribution of vector species exists in a particular
   area. The present study was carried out to identify the distribution of
   An. culicifacies sibling species in certain endemic district of Central
   India, Madhya Pradesh.
   Methods: The An. culicifacies mosquitoes collected from the study
   districts were identified morphologically. The genomic DNA was isolated
   from the mosquitoes and subjected to Allele specific PCR targeting D3
   domain of 28S ribosomal DNA.
   Results: The mean prevalence of An. culicifacies during the study period
   was in the range of 8-120 per man per hour (PMH). From the study areas
   species B was identified from Jabalpur, Chindwara and Hoshangabad,
   Species C from Hoshangabad only, Species D from Narsinghpur and Khandwa
   and sibling species E from Mandla, Chindwara and Hoshangabad
   respectively.
   Conclusion: This is the first report to detect species E from Madhya
   Pradesh region which necessitate for reconsideration of species
   distribution of each An. culicifacies sibling species that would enable
   to develop required vector control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of dengue vectors provide baseline information about the
   abundance and subsequent management strategy. An appraisal of mosquito
   abundance using dengue vectors as focal species was made in respect to
   Kolkata, India as geographical area. The data on immature abundance in
   the container larval habitats viz, earthen, porcelain and plastic
   materials were subjected to three-way factorial ANOVA, using months,
   habitats and species as variables. Similar tests were done on pupal
   weight and wing length. It was observed that Anopheles subpictus, Culex
   quinquefasciatus coexist with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in
   different container habitats, that varied with months and habitats. Ae.
   aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in higher proportions in porcelain
   and plastic containers. In earthen containers a stable ratio of three
   mosquitoes was observed. Sex specific variations in pupal weight and
   wing length were noted in both species of Ae. aegypti and Ae.
   albopictus. The wing length of adult Aedes mosquitoes showed
   correspondence with pupal weight suggesting the use of pupal weight can
   be used as indicator of prospective adult body size. Although less known
   as container breeding, presence of An. subpictus and Cx.
   quinquefascistus along with Aedes indicates that availability of waste
   containers in environment increases risks of dengue and other mosquito
   borne diseases. The present habitat-based study calls for a strict
   vector management strategy to reduce the sources of ovipostion in
   various container habitats to minimize the mosquito vectors and thus
   potential risk of dengue and other mosquito borne diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Anopheles minimus and An. fluviatilis were
   incriminated as the major malaria vectors in Keonjhar district of Odisha
   State recently. This study was carried out to elucidate the potential
   role of these two vector species in transmission of malaria during
   different seasons, and vectorial capacity of these species was also
   estimated.
   Methods: Three hilly and forested villages of Keonjhar district were
   randomly selected. Vectorial capacity (C) was calculated using the
   Macdonald's formula as modified by Garret-Jones. The human landing
   density of the vector species was obtained from all night human landing
   collections (bait protected by bed-net). Man feeding habit was estimated
   by multiplying the human blood index with feeding frequency, which was
   obtained on daily basis from the duration of gonotrophic cycle. The
   probability of survival through the extrinsic incubation cycle was
   calculated from the probability of survival through one day and duration
   of sporogonic cycle.
   Results: The estimated vectorial capacity of An. minimus varied between
   0.014 and 1.09 for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and between 0.1 and 1.46
   for P. vivax (Pv). The C of An. minimus for both Pf and Pv was higher
   during rainy season than the other two seasons. The estimated C of An.
   fluviatilis varied between 0.04 and 1.28 for Pf and between 0.20 and
   1.54 for Pv.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Based on the estimated values of
   vectorial capacity of the two vector species, the area could be
   stratified and such stratification would reflect the difference in the
   intensity of transmission between different strata and accordingly the
   appropriate control strategy could be adopted for each stratum.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of multiple putatively neutral DNA markers for inferring
   evolutionary history of species population is considered to be the most
   robust approach. Molecular population genetic studies have been
   conducted in many species of Anopheles genus, but studies based on
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are still very scarce.
   Anopheles minimus is one of the principal malaria vectors of Southeast
   (SE) Asia including the Northeastern (NE) India. Although population
   genetic studies with mitochondrial genetic variation data have been
   utilized to infer phylogeography of the SE Asian populations of this
   species, limited information on the population structure and demography
   of Indian An.minimus is available. We herewith have developed multilocus
   nuclear genetic approach with SNP markers located in X chromosome of
   An.minimus in eight Indian and two SE Asian population samples (121
   individual mosquitoes in total) to infer population history and test
   several hypotheses on the phylogeography of this species. While the Thai
   population sample of An.minimus presented the highest nucleotide
   diversity, majority of the Indian samples were also fairly diverse. In
   general, An.minimus populations were moderately substructured in the
   distribution range covering SE Asia and NE India, largely falling under
   three distinct genetic clusters. Moreover, demographic expansion events
   could be detected in the majority of the presently studied populations
   of An.minimus. Additional DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial COII
   region in a subset of the samples (40 individual mosquitoes)
   corroborated the existing hypothesis of Indian An.minimus falling under

Abstract = {{Anopheles stephensi is an important vector of urban malaria in India and
   the Persian Gulf area. Its previously known geographical range includes
   southern Asia and the Arab Peninsula. For the first time, we report A.
   stephensi from the African continent, based on collections made in
   Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, where this species' occurrence was
   linked to an unusual urban outbreak of Plasmodium falciparum malaria,
   with 1228 cases reported from February to May 2013, and a second, more
   severe epidemic that emerged in November 2013 and resulted in 2017
   reported malaria cases between January and February 2014. Anopheles
   stephensi was initially identified using morphological identification
   keys, followed by sequencing of the Barcode cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI)
   gene and the rDNA second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2). Positive
   tests for P. falciparum circumsporozoite antigen in two of six female A.
   stephensi trapped in homes of malaria patients in March 2013 are
   evidence that autochthonous urban malaria transmission by A. stephensi
   has occurred. Concurrent with the second malaria outbreak, P.
   falciparum-positive A. stephensi females were detected in Djibouti City
   starting in November 2013. In sub-Saharan Africa, newly present A.
   stephensi may pose a significant future health threat because of this
   species' high susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and its
   tolerance of urban habitats. This may lead to increased malaria
   outbreaks in African cities. Rapid interruption of the urban malaria
   transmission cycle, based on integrated vector surveillance and control
   programs aimed at the complete eradication of A. stephensi from the
   African continent, is strongly recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Selection of an insecticide and its
   appropriate formulation is a prerequisite of formulating any chemical
   control strategy against vectors. A hut scale field trial was carried
   out to study the effectiveness of house spraying with capsule suspension
   (CS) formulation of lambdacyhalothrin in comparison with its wettable
   powder (WP) formulation on mortality, density and behaviour of malaria
   vector in Malkangiri district, Odisha, India.
   Methods: The two formulations were tested at 20 and 30 mg (a.i.)/m(2)
   for their effectiveness in terms of deterrence, excito-repellency,
   blood-feeding success, mortality and residual activity against Anopheles
   fluviatilis, the major malaria vector, in experimental huts in
   Malkangiri district, Odisha State, India.
   Results: Both CS and WP formulations prevented the entry of An.
   fluviatilis in to the sprayed huts by >90 per cent for >6 months, the
   entire peak malaria transmission season in the area. The exit rate
   increased (90-99\%) with different treatments and the feeding rate was
   reduced (91-97\%). There was no significant difference between WP 30, CS
   20 and CS 30 mg/m(2) in these respects. However, WP 20 mg/m(2) caused a
   lesser effect than the other three groups. The formulations or the
   dosages differed only in causing vector mortalities. Overall, the total
   mortality rate of An. fluviatilis was higher in the huts sprayed with CS
   30 (58\%) than the huts sprayed with CS 20 (48\%), WP 20 (37\%) and WP
   30 mg/m(2) (47\%).
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Considering the duration of residual
   action and the effect on entry, exit, feeding and mortality of An.
   fluviatilis, the dosage 20 mg/m(2) of CS formulation of
   lambdacyhalothrin could be considered for further use.}},

Title = {{Fluorescence spectral diagnosis of malaria - a preliminary study}},
Journal = {{DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is the most common disease transmitted by the bite
   by an infected female anopheles mosquito and caused by the plasmodium
   parasite. It is mostly prevalent in subtropical regions receiving
   abundant rain and supporting copious mosquito breeding. This disease is
   generally detected by the microscopic examination of blood films or
   antigen based rapid diagnostic test. Only occasionally the parasite DNA
   is detected using polymerase chain reaction in certain advanced,
   expensive laboratories.
   Methods: An innovative spectral detection method based on the
   fluorescence spectra of a set of blood plasma biomolecules {[}tyrosine,
   tryptophan, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and flavin adenine
   dinucleotide (FAD)] and red blood cell (RBC)-associated porphyrin is
   being evolved by our group.
   Results: The research so far has exhibited sensitivity and specificity
   values exceeding 90\% based on the spectral features of blood components
   of 14 malaria patients and 20 numbers of age adjusted normal controls.
   The fluorescent biomolecules go out of proportion when the malarial
   parasite breaks down the hemoglobin of blood.
   Conclusion: This technique has the potential to be used as an
   alternative diagnostic procedure for malaria since the instrumentation
   involved is portable and inexpensive.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: An alarming rate of deforestation has been
   reported from Sonitpur district of Assam, India therefore, a study was
   initiated during 2009 using remote sensing (RS) to assess deforested
   areas in the district and to study the impact on malaria vectors in
   order to formulate appropriate control strategy.
   Methods: RS imageries of 2000 and 2009 were used to assess deforested
   areas in the selected district. Entomological data were collected in
   four surveys during 2009-2011. The data were analyzed statistically
   using test of single proportions (chi(2)) and pair-wise comparison.
   Vector incrimination was done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was calculated to
   estimate transmission intensity.
   Results: The deforested areas were identified in north-western parts of
   Sonitpur district falling in Dhekiajuli Primary Health Centre (PHC). The
   forest cover of the PHC decreased >50\% during 2000-2009. Five species
   of anopheline vectors were collected. Anopheles minimus sensu lato (s.l)
   was collected least abundantly while An. culicifacies s.l prevailed most
   abundantly and significant difference was observed between proportions
   of the collected vector species. Pair-wise comparison between An.
   culicifacies s.l and An. minimus s.l was also found statistically
   significant indicating that An. culicifacies s.l. is establishing its
   population in deforested areas. An. culicifacies s.l. was found ELISA
   positive and EIR was measured as 4.8 during transmission season.
   Conclusion: An. culicifacies s.l replaced An. minimus s.l, the vector of
   malaria in northeast India and was found ELISA positive, therefore could
   have possible role in malaria transmission in the deforested areas of
   the district.}},

Title = {{A note on the insecticide susceptibility status of principal malaria

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: The major malaria vector, Anopheles
   culicifacies Giles is reported to contribute similar to 65\% of the
   malaria cases in India. This species developed resistance to DDT and
   later to HCH, malathion and also to pyrethroids in some states due to
   their use in the national malaria control programme. In the present
   study, insecticide susceptibility of this species was monitored in four
   states of India.
   Methods: To determine insecticide susceptibility status of the major
   malaria vector An. culicifacies, adult mosquitoes were collected from
   different localities of 32 tribal districts in the states of Andhra
   Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal during October/November
   2009-10. Mosquitoes were collected from stratified ecotypes comprising a
   group of districts in West Bengal and individual districts in three
   other states. Mosquitoes were exposed to papers treated with WHO
   diagnostic dose: 4\% DDT, 5\% malathion and 0.05\% deltamethrin
   following the WHO tube method.
   Results: Results provided the susceptibility status of An. culicifacies
   to different insecticides used in the public health programme in 32
   districts in four states. An. culicifacies was found resistant to DDT
   (mortality range 0-36\%) in all the 32 districts; to malathion it was
   resistant in 14 districts, verification required in 10 districts and
   susceptible in eight districts (mortality range 32.2-100\%). It was
   resistant to deltamethrin in four districts, verification required in 11
   districts and susceptible in 17 districts (mortality range 43.3-100\%).
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Development of widespread resistance to
   insecticides used in public health sprays for vector control including
   to pyrethroids in An. culicifacies in the surveyed districts is of great
   concern for the malaria control programme as the major interventions for
   vector control are heavily reliant on chemical insecticides, mainly
   synthetic pyrethroids used both for indoor residual spraying and for
   long-lasting insecticidal nets. Thus, there is a need to periodically
   monitor and update the susceptibility status of malaria vector(s) to
   suggest alternative vector control strategies for effective disease
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The control of arthropod (ecto) parasites and disease vectors by use of
   industrial chemicals being fraught with various problems calls for
   alternative approaches. Natural products offer world's resource-poor
   farmers a cheaper, eco-friendly and sustainable alternative.
   Ethno-veterinary and traditional knowledge has provided a vast range of
   plants to be evaluated for their repellent, insecticidal and acaricidal
   properties. Phyto-chemical analysis of medicinal plants has been
   increasingly generating evidence of presence of bioactive compounds in
   extracts derived from them. With the current emphasis on reduction
   (management) of arthropod numbers to acceptable levels, plant products
   are likely to play a greater role. A large number of efficacy studies in
   recent years, both in India and abroad, have validated their bioactivity
   against various target insects and acarines. These studies covered a
   wide spectrum of arthropod parasites but mosquitoes and ixodid ticks due
   to their vector significance attracted maximum attention. The widely
   prevalent cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus appeared to
   predominate as the most frequent target species. Plant products have
   considerable potential, which can possibly be further enhanced by
   improved technology and fine-tuning of delivery systems such as use of
   nano-capsules and nano-particles. Plant derived acaricides can also be
   harnessed as a component of an integrated pest management program. In
   this article, the current state of knowledge on phyto-chemical sources
   along with their cidal and inhibitory activity on various stages of
   target insect and acarine species, the nature of active ingredients and
   promising advances, has been reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{We validated the feasibility of using Plasmodium falciparum, the human
   malaria parasite, DNA present in wild caught vector mosquitoes for the
   characterization of chloroquine resistance status. House frequenting
   mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles minimus complex were collected from

   DNA was extracted from the head-thorax region of individual mosquitoes.
   Anopheles minimus complex mosquitoes were identified to species level
   and screened for the presence of Plasmodium sp. using molecular tools.
   Nested PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping of P. falciparum based on
   K76T mutation in the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene.
   Three of the 27 wild caught An. minimus mosquitoes were harbouring P.
   falciparum sporozoites (positivity 11.1\%) and all 3 were had 76T
   mutation in the pfcrt gene, indicating chloroquine resistance. The

Abstract = {{The abundance, richness and diversity of anopheline and culicid
   mosquitoes associated with their habitats, season, and physico-chemical
   quality of water were surveyed along six districts of Mizoram, North
   Eastern Himalayan region. The productivity of permanent and temporary
   habitat types was quantified by carrying out weekly larval sampling
   using a standard dipping method for a period of three years. Diversity
   was estimated using the Shannon index (H'), Evenness index (Heve),
   similarity measures cluster analysis and MANOVA. In total, 5 genera and
   20 species of mosquitoes were identified: Culex quinquefasciatus,
   Anopheles barbirostris and Anopheles vagus were the most abundant and
   widely-distributed species, representing 39.71\%, 29.39\% and 14.52\% of
   total mosquito individuals sampled, respectively. Anopheles sp.
   diversity was lowest in Lunglei district (H' = 0.48) and highest in
   Aizawl (H' = 2.03), whereas Culex sp. diversity was lowest in Lawngtlai
   (H' = 0.38), and highest in Aizawl (H' = 2.99) and Kolasib (H' = 2.13).
   This represents the first update on the diversity and geographic
   distribution of the mosquitoes of Mizoram. Mosquito larvae were present
   in both temporary and permanent habitats suitable for breeding with
   monthly variations dependent on rainfall intensity, temperature,
   humidity and location. Early instars were more abundant significantly (P
   < 0.0001) than late instars among the habitat types in all study sites.
   The productivity of mosquito larvae was significantly (P < 0.0001)
   higher in ponds especially in permanent than semi-permanent and
   temporary. Weekly rainfall intensity led to an increase or decrease in
   anopheline and culicid larval abundance depending on the location.
   Mosquito diversity was highest in monsoon season (July-September) and
   lowest in January-March. A. barbirostris, A. vagus and C
   quinquefasciatus appear the most likely habitat generalist as it
   demonstrates both widespread distribution. Abundance and diversity of
   culicine and anopheline larvae were strongly associated (MANOVA) with
   pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, phosphates and chlorides
   concentration of water. This information will be essential for designing
   and implementing mosquito larval control programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anopheles annularis is one of the major vectors of malaria in Odisha,
   India. The present study was undertaken to determine the vectorial
   capacity and assess the genetic diversity of An. annularis collected
   from different endemic regions of Odisha. Mosquitoes were collected from
   thirteen endemic districts using standard entomological collection
   methods from 2009 to 2011. Sibling species of An. annularis were
   identified by PCR-RFLP and sequencing of D3 region of 28S ribosomal DNA
   (rDNA) region. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite rate and human
   blood fed percentage (HBF) were estimated by multiplex PCR using Pf and
   human specific primers. Genetic diversity of An. annularis was estimated
   by ISSR markers. Out of 1647 An. annularis collected, 1353 (82.15\%)
   were collected by mechanical aspirators and 294 (17.85\%) by light trap.
   49 (2.97\%) were positive for human blood and 18 (1.09\%) were positive
   for Pf sporozoite. PCR-RFLP and sequencing analyses detected only An
   annularis A in the study areas. Overall genetic differentiation among
   An. annularis populations was moderate (F-ST = 0.048) and showed
   significant correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance
   (r = 0.882; P < 0.05). Angul population proved to be genetically unique
   and was highly divergent F-ST > 0.110) from other populations,
   suggesting low gene flow between them. The study indicated that only An.
   annularis A was found in Odisha with potential vectorial capacity that
   can play a major role in malaria transmission. ISSR markers proved to be
   useful molecular tools to evaluate genetic variability in An. annularis
   populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Isolation and complete nucleotide sequence of a Batai virus strain in
   Inner Mongolia, China}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Batai virus (BATV) is a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus
   of the family Bunyaviridae, and a vector-borne pathogen. Genomic
   variations of BATV exist in different regions of the world, due to
   genetic reassortment. Whole-genome sequencing of any isolate is
   necessary for a phylogenetic analysis. In 1998, a BATV strain was
   isolated from an Anopheles philippines mosquito in Yunnan Province,
   China. This strain has not been found to infect any other host. We
   investigated BATV infection in cattle in Inner Mongolia, China and
   performed deep sequencing of the genome of the BATV isolate.
   Findings: Ninety-five blood samples were collected from cattle in Inner
   Mongolia, China in 2012. The BATV infection rate was 2.1\%. Previously,
   BATV strain NM/12 was isolated from two cattle in Inner Mongolia, China,
   and the whole genomic sequence of the strain has been available. We
   determined the complete genomic nucleotide sequences of the small (S),
   medium (M), and large (L) genome segments using bovine blood obtained in
   2012, and the nucleotide homologies of these segments with those from
   GenBank were 88.7\%-97\%, 84\%-95.4\%, and 72.6\%-95.8\%, respectively.
   The deduced amino acid identities were 87.2-99.7\%, 64.2-96.8\%, and
   81.1-98.6\%. Phylogenetic analyses based on full-length genomic
   sequences indicated that the M and L segments, and a portion of the S
   segment, of NM/12 are most closely related to the BATV strains isolated
   in Asia. The S and M segments of NM/12 were independent of phylogenetic
   lineages. The L segment was the most closely related to
   Chittoor/IG-20217 (isolated in India), and distantly related to isolated
   strains in Italy. Nucleotide substitution rates in the nucleotide
   sequences that code for the nucleocapsid, envelope glycoprotein, and
   polymerase protein of NM/12 strain were 2.56\%, 4.69\%, and 4.21\%,
   respectively, relative to the original strain of MM2222.
   Conclusion: A novel BATV NM/12 strain from bovine serum collected in
   Inner Mongolia was isolated from cattle in China for the first time. Our
   findings elucidate the evolutionary status of the BATV NM/12 strain
   among different orthobunyavirus strains and may provide some clues to
   prevent the emergence of BATV infection in cattle and humans.}},

Abstract = {{Background objectives: I ntegrated vector management (IVM) emphasizes
   sustainable eco-friendly methods and minimal use of chemicals. In this
   context, the present study highlights the environmental control of
   breeding of Anopheles fluviatilis, the primary malaria vector, through
   water management in a natural stream in Koraput district, Odisha, India.
   Methods: The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), Koraput,
   constructed two bed-dams across streams, one in Barigaon and the other
   in Pipalapodar village. The bed-dam in the former village was fitted
   with two sluice gates whereas the bed dam constructed in the latter
   village was without the sluice gate. t0 he sluice gates were opened once
   in a week on a fixed day to flush out the water from the dam. Anopheles
   immatures were sampled systematically in the streams using a dipper for
   density measurement and species composition.
   Results: There was a reduction of 84.9 per cent in the proportion of
   positive dips for a0 nopheles larvae/pupae and a reduction of 98.4 per
   cent in immature density (number/dip) of An. fluviatilis in the
   experimental downstream compared to the control following opening of the
   sluice gates.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: our findins showed that opening of sluice
   gates of the bed-dam regularly once in a week resulted in the control of
   Vector Control Research Centre (ICMR) Our findins showed that opening of
   sluice gates of the bed-dam regularly once in a week resulted in the
   control of vector breeding in the downstream due to the flushing effect
   of the water released with a high flow from the bed-dam that stagnated
   water in the upstream. The outcome of the study encourages upscaling
   this measure to other areas, wherever feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Development of insecticide resistance (IR) in mosquito vectors is a
   primary huddle to malaria control program. Since IR has genetic basis,
   and genes constantly evolve with response to environment for adaptation
   to organisms, it is important to know evolutionary pattern of genes
   conferring IR in malaria vectors. The mosquito Anopheles minimus is a
   major malaria vector of the Southeast (SE) Asia and India and is
   susceptible to all insecticides, and thus of interest to know if natural
   selection has shaped variations in the gene conferring IR. If not, the
   DNA fragment of such a gene could be used to infer population structure
   and demography of this species of malaria vector. We have therefore
   sequenced a similar to 569 bp DNA segment of the NADPH cytochrome P450
   reductase (CPR) gene (widely known to confer IR) in 123 individuals of
   An. minimus collected in 10 different locations (eight Indian, one Thai
   and one Vietnamese). Two Indian population samples were completely
   mono-morphic in the CPR gene. In general, low genetic diversity was
   found with no evidence of natural selection in this gene. The data were
   therefore analyzed to infer population structure and demography of this
   species. The 10 populations could be genetically differentiated into
   four different groups; the samples from Thailand and Vietnam contained
   high nucleotide diversity. All the 10 populations conform to demographic
   equilibrium model with signature of past population expansion in four
   populations. The results in general indicate that the An. minimus
   mosquitoes sampled in the two SE Asian localities contain several
   genetic characteristics of being parts of the ancestral population.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles subpictus Grassi s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) functions as a
   secondary malaria vector to Anopheles culicifacies Giles s.l. (Diptera:
   Culicidae) in Sri Lanka. The taxon A. subpictus is reported to exist as
   a species complex comprising four sibling species (A-D) that can be
   differentiated through polytene chromosome banding patterns and
   stage-specific morphometric traits in India. Based on the morphological
   characteristics described for the Indian Subpictus Complex, the presence
   of all four sibling species has been described in Sri Lanka. As sibling
   species show distinct bio-ecological characteristics that are important
   for devising appropriate vector control measures, a study was carried
   out in six districts in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The results confirm
   the presence of all four sibling species, with species C predominating
   in inland areas and species B in coastal areas. Species C and D were
   indoor-resting and indoor-feeding, while species B was outdoor-resting
   with no significant preference for indoor- or outdoor-resting. Species B
   showed distinct morphological variation in the ornamentation of wings
   and palpi. Blood meal analysis revealed that species B, C, and D can
   feed on humans as well as cattle. The differential bio-ecological traits
   shown by the members of the Subpictus Complex are important for
   developing appropriate vector control measures in Sri Lanka.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Background: Molecular techniques are invaluable for investigation on the
   biodiversity of Anopheles mosquitoes. This study aimed at investigating
   the spatial-genetic variations among Anopheles mosquitoes from different
   areas of Peninsular Malaysia, as well as deciphering evolutionary
   relationships of the local Anopheles mosquitoes with the mosquitoes from
   neighbouring countries using the anopheline ITS2 rDNA gene.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected, identified, dissected to check
   infection status, and DNA extraction was performed for PCR with primers
   targeting the ITS2 rDNA region. Sequencing was done and phylogenetic
   tree was constructed to study the evolutionary relationship among
   Anopheles mosquitoes within Peninsular Malaysia, as well as across the
   Asian region.
   Results: A total of 133 Anopheles mosquitoes consisting of six different
   species were collected from eight different locations across Peninsular
   Malaysia. Of these, 65 ITS2 rDNA sequences were obtained. The ITS2 rDNA
   amplicons of the studied species were of different sizes. One collected
   species, Anopheles sinensis, shows two distinct pools of population in
   Peninsular Malaysia, suggesting evolvement of geographic race or
   allopatric speciation.
   Conclusion: Anopheles mosquitoes from Peninsular Malaysia show close
   evolutionary relationship with the Asian anophelines. Nevertheless,
   genetic differences due to geographical segregation can be seen.
   Meanwhile, some Anopheles mosquitoes in Peninsular Malaysia show
   vicariance, exemplified by the emergence of distinct cluster of An.
   sinensis population.}},

Abstract = {{Five types of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs), namely, Olyset,
   Netprotect, PermaNet, DuraNet, and Interceptor, were tested after 20
   washes for efficacy in terms of mortality, deterrence effect,
   blood-feeding inhibition, and induced exophily of the malaria vector
   Anopheles fluviatilis in experimental huts in Malkangiri district of
   Odisha State, India. Efficacy of the three synthetic pyrethroids (SPs)
   used in the LNs was also analyzed. Use of LNs reduced the entry of An.
   fluviatilis into the huts by 73.3-83.2\%, and the five LNs were
   comparable in terms of deterrence. The exit rate of An. fluviatilis from
   the huts with untreated net was 56.3\%, and relative to this, Olyset
   followed by DuraNet induced significantly a higher exophily. In
   contrast, the exit rate was significantly lower with Interceptor. Among
   the three SPs, permethrin induced significantly greater exophily
   relative to the untreated control, and as a result of this,
   permethrin-treated Olyset produced a lower mortality. Blood-feeding rate
   of An. fluviatilis was significantly lower with all the five LNs than
   the control. Similarly, all the three SPs significantly inhibited blood
   feeding compared with the control. Interceptor and DuraNet, both
   alphacypermethrin-treated LNs, caused relatively a higher mortality of
   An. fluviatilis than the other LNs. The five brands of LNs and three SPs
   tested in the current study were equally effective in terms of
   deterrence and blood-feeding inhibition; only exiting and killing effect
   differed among them. Permethrin-treated LNs induced greater exophily,
   while, overall, alphacypermethrin-treated LNs killed more An.
   fluviatilis that entered the huts. Advantage of deterrence,
   excito-repellent, and killing effects of LNs and appropriate selection
   of SP for net treatment are discussed in this paper.}},

Title = {{Relative Roles of Weather Variables and Change in Human Population in
   Malaria: Comparison over Different States of India}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pro-active and effective control as well as quantitative
   assessment of impact of climate change on malaria requires
   identification of the major drivers of the epidemic. Malaria depends on
   vector abundance which, in turn, depends on a combination of weather
   variables. However, there remain several gaps in our understanding and
   assessment of malaria in a changing climate. Most of the studies have
   considered weekly or even monthly mean values of weather variables,
   while the malaria vector is sensitive to daily variations. Secondly,
   rarely all the relevant meteorological variables have been considered
   together. An important question is the relative roles of weather
   variables (vector abundance) and change in host (human) population, in
   the change in disease load.
   Method: We consider the 28 states of India, characterized by diverse
   climatic zones and changing population as well as complex variability in
   malaria, as a natural test bed. An annual vector load for each of the 28
   states is defined based on the number of vector genesis days computed
   using daily values of temperature, rainfall and humidity from NCEP daily
   Reanalysis; a prediction of potential malaria load is defined by taking
   into consideration changes in the human population and compared with the
   reported number of malaria cases.
   Results: For most states, the number of malaria cases is very well
   correlated with the vector load calculated with the combined conditions
   of daily values of temperature, rainfall and humidity; no single weather
   variable has any significant association with the observed disease
   prevalence.
   Conclusion: The association between vector-load and daily values of
   weather variables is robust and holds for different climatic regions
   (states of India). Thus use of all the three weather variables provides
   a reliable means of pro-active and efficient vector sanitation and
   control as well as assessment of impact of climate change on malaria.}},

Title = {{Malaria control in Nepal 1963-2012: challenges on the path towards
   elimination}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is still a priority public health problem of Nepal
   where about 84\% of the population are at risk. The aim of this paper is
   to highlight the past and present malaria situation in this country and
   its challenges for long-term malaria elimination strategies.
   Methods: Malariometric indicator data of Nepal recorded through routine
   surveillance of health facilities for the years between 1963 and 2012
   were compiled. Trends and differences in malaria indicator data were
   analysed.
   Results: The trend of confirmed malaria cases in Nepal between 1963 and
   2012 shows fluctuation, with a peak in 1985 when the number exceeded
   42,321, representing the highest malaria case-load ever recorded in
   Nepal. This was followed by a steep declining trend of malaria with some
   major outbreaks. Nepal has made significant progress in controlling
   malaria transmission over the past decade: total confirmed malaria cases
   declined by 84\% (12,750 in 2002 vs 2,092 in 2012), and there was only
   one reported death in 2012. Based on the evaluation of the National
   Malaria Control Programme in 2010, Nepal recently adopted a long-term
   malaria elimination strategy for the years 2011-2026 with the ambitious
   vision of a malaria-free Nepal by 2026. However, there has been an
   increasing trend of Plasmodium falciparum and imported malaria
   proportions in the last decade. Furthermore, the analysis of
   malariometric indicators of 31 malaria-risk districts between 2004 and
   2012 shows a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of
   confirmed malaria and of Plasmodium vivax, but not in the incidence of
   P. falciparum and clinically suspected malaria.
   Conclusions: Based on the achievements the country has made over the
   last decade, Nepal is preparing to move towards malaria elimination by
   2026. However, considerable challenges lie ahead. These include
   especially, the need to improve access to diagnostic facilities to
   confirm clinically suspected cases and their treatment, the development
   of resistance in parasites and vectors, climate change, and increasing
   numbers of imported cases from a porous border with India. Therefore,
   caution is needed before the country embarks towards malaria
   elimination.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria continues to be a major health problem in more than 100 endemic
   countries located primarily in tropical and sub-tropical regions around
   the world. Malaria transmission is a dynamic process and involves many
   interlinked factors, from uncontrollable natural environmental
   conditions to man-made disturbances to nature. Almost half of the
   population at risk of malaria lives in forest areas. Forests are hot
   beds of malaria transmission as they provide conditions such as
   vegetation cover, temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions that are
   conducive to distribution and survival of malaria vectors. Forests often
   lack infrastructure and harbor tribes with distinct genetic traits,
   socio-cultural beliefs and practices that greatly influence malaria
   transmission dynamics. Here we summarize the various topographical,
   entomological, parasitological, human ecological and socio-economic
   factors, which are crucial and shape malaria transmission in forested
   areas. An in-depth understanding and synthesis of the intricate
   relationship of these parameters in achieving better malaria control in
   various types of forest ecosystems is emphasized.}},

Title = {{Genetic Structure and Wolbachia Genotyping in Naturally Occurring
   Populations of Aedes albopictus across Contiguous Landscapes of Orissa,
   India}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aedes albopictus has recently been implicated as a major
   vector in the emergence of dengue and chikungunya in several parts of
   India, like Orissa, which is gradually gaining endemicity for arboviral
   diseases. Ae. albopictus is further known to be naturally infected with
   Wolbachia (maternally inherited bacterium), which causes cytoplasmic
   incompatibility (CI) in mosquitoes leading to sperm-egg incompatibility
   inducing the death of embryo. Knowledge of genetic diversity of Ae.
   albopictus, along with revealing the type of Wolbachia infection in Ae.
   albopictus is important to explore the genetic and biological
   characteristics of Ae. albopictus, prior to exploring the uses of
   CI-based vector control strategies. In this study, we assessed the
   population genetic structure and the pattern of Wolbachia infection in
   Ae. albopictus mosquitoes of Orissa.
   Methods and Results: Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were collected from 15
   districts representing the four physiographical regions of Orissa from
   2010-2012, analyzed for genetic variability at seven microsatellite loci
   and genotyped for Wolbachia strain detection using wsp gene primers.
   Most microsatellite markers were successfully amplified and were
   polymorphic, showing moderate genetic structure among all geographic
   populations (F-ST = 0.088). Genetic diversity was high (F-ST = 0.168) in
   Coastal Plains populations when compared with other populations, which
   was also evident from cluster analyses that showed most Coastal Plains
   populations consisted of a separate genetic cluster. Genotyping analyses
   revealed that Wolbachia-infected Ae. albopictus field populations of
   Orissa were mostly superinfected with wAlbA and wAlbB strains. Wolbachia
   superinfection was more pronounced in the Coastal Plain populations.
   Conclusion: High genetic structure and Wolbachia superinfection,
   observed in the Coastal Plain populations of Orissa suggested it to be
   genetically and biologically more unique than other populations, and
   hence could influence their vectorial attributes. Such high genetic
   diversity observed among Coastal Plains populations could be attributed
   to multiple introductions of Ae. albopictus in this region.}},

Title = {{Effect of irrigation systems on temporal distribution of malaria vectors

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{349-359}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Previous research models have used climate data to explain habitat
   conditions of Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting malaria parasites.
   Although they can estimate mosquito populations with sufficient accuracy
   in many areas, observational data show that there is a tendency to
   underestimate the active growth and reproduction period of mosquitoes in
   semi-arid agricultural regions. In this study, a new, modified model
   that includes irrigation as a factor was developed to predict the active
   growing period of mosquitoes more precisely than the base model for
   ecophysiological and climatological distribution of mosquito generations
   (ECD-mg). Five sites with complete sets of observational data were
   selected in semi-arid regions of India for the comparison. The active
   growing period of mosquitoes determined from the modified ECD-mg model
   that incorporated the irrigation factor was in agreement with the
   observational data, whereas the active growing period was underestimated
   by the previous ECD-mg model that did not incorporate irrigation. This
   suggests that anthropogenic changes in the water supply due to extensive
   irrigation can encourage the growth of Anopheles mosquitoes through the
   alteration of the natural water balance in their habitat. In addition,
   it was found that the irrigation systems not only enable the active
   growth of mosquitoes in dry seasons but also play an important role in
   stabilizing the growth in rainy seasons. Consequently, the irrigation
   systems could lengthen the annual growing period of Anopheles mosquitoes
   and increase the maximum generation number of mosquitoes in semi-arid
   subtropical regions.}},

Abstract = {{Use of chemical pesticides is the current method for controlling
   sandflies. However, resistance is being developed in sandflies against
   the insecticide of choice that is DDT (dichlorodiphenyl
   trichloroethane). Botanicals have potential to act as an alternative to
   chemical insecticides as the crude extracts and active molecules of some
   plants show insecticidal effect to sandflies. This will lead to safe,
   easy and environment friendly method for control of sandflies.
   Therefore, information regarding botanicals acting as alternative to
   chemical insecticide against sandflies assumes importance in the context
   of development of resistance to insecticides as well as to prevent
   environment from contamination. This review deals with some plants and
   their products having repellent and insecticidal effect to sandflies in
   India and abroad. Different methods of extraction and their bioassay on
   sandflies have been emphasized in the text. Various extracts of some
   plants like Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae), Solanum jasminoides
   (Solanaceae), Bougainvillea glabra (Nyctaginaceae), Capparis spinosa
   (Capparidaceae), Acalypha fruticosa (Euphorbiaceae) and Tagetes minuta
   (Asteraceae) had shown repellent/insecticidal effect on sandflies. This
   review will be useful in conducting the research work to find out
   botanicals of Indian context having insecticidal effect on sandflies.}},

Abstract = {{In southern Punjab, Pakistan, Muzaffargarh District is known to have
   insecticide-resistant Anopheles and drug-resistant Plasmodium spp. In
   this part of the country, five anopheline mosquitoes, Anopheles
   stephensi Liston, Anopheles culicifacies Giles, Anopheles fluviatilis
   James, Anopheles superpictus Grassi, and Anopheles subpictus Grassi
   (Diptera: Culicidae) are known as malaria vectors. Among these, An.
   culicifacies is the primary and An. stephensi is the secondary malaria
   vector. Outbreaks of malaria usually occur after rainy episodes. We
   conducted field surveys to collect field strains of An. culicifacies and
   An. stephensi mosquitoes from different areas of Muzaffargarh District.
   We determined susceptibility and irritability levels of their adult
   stages to the discriminative dose of different insecticides. For this
   purpose, we used World Health Organization's established criteria for
   assessment. Mortality was calculated after 1 h exposure and for 24 h
   recovery period for various insecticides. An. stephensi was found to be
   significantly resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT, an
   organochlorine), dieldrin (a chlorinated hydrocarbon), and malathion
   (organophosphorus), with lethal times (LT50) of 83.17, 52.48, and 37.53,
   respectively. However, the species was significantly sensitive to
   permethrin, deltamethrin (pyrethroids), and fenitrothion
   (organophosphate) with LT50 of 2.85, 2.34, and 13.18, respectively.
   Among these, permethrin showed more promising results against adult An.
   stephensi. When analyzed for irritancy, we found that among pyrethroids,
   permethrin was the most irritant insecticide for both An. stephensi and
   An. culicifacies. DDT and dieldrin showed least irritancy with 0.42 +/-
   0.08 and 0.77 +/- 0.12 takeoffs per minute per adult, respectively,
   against An. stephensi. The mean number of takeoffs per minute per adult
   with permethrin showed significant irritancy for permethrin when
   compared with DDT. Based on this study, we conclude that the use of
   organochlorine (DDT) and chlorinated hydrocarbon (dieldrin) should not
   be reintroduced in Malaria Control Programme in Pakistan until there is
   enough evidence to do so at any stage in future, and the use of
   pyrethroids should continue, with preference to permethrin for better
   control of malaria by indoor residual spraying.}},

   relatively larger ponds and very slow running water bodies well shaded
   from sunlight with floating aquatic plants provided the largest area for
   Anopheles larvae breeding and accounted for 40\% of all Anopheles larva
   and 25.4\% total Anopheles spp. collected. An. campestris (NSK01),
   maculatus (NSK04), philippinensis (NSK06), nivipes (NSK10) and
   jeyporiensis (NSK09) were strongly anthropogenic and endophagic while
   vagus (NSK18) and jamesii (NSK03) were found to be highly zoophilic and
   exophilic and An. peditaeniatus (NSK02), annularis (NSK07) and sinensis
   (NSK15) were found to be highly zoophilic. Because of its abundance and
   bionomics, An. campestris, jeyporiensis and nivipes may have played a
   role in malarial transmission throughout the year. This is the first
   study reported on Anopheline distribution and abundance in Thenzawl,
   Mizoram.}},

Title = {{Response of malaria vectors to conventional insecticides in the southern

Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Updating information on response (susceptible
   /resistant status) of vectors to the insecticides in use is essential to
   formulate and introduce appropriate resistance management strategy.
   Therefore, a study was undertaken in the 10 southern districts of Odisha
   State, which are endemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, to determine
   the insecticide susceptibility/resistance status of Anopheles
   fluviatilis and An. culicifacies, the vectors of malaria.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected during September 2010 - February 2012
   from 60 randomly selected villages in the 10 districts and blood-fed
   females were exposed to the diagnostic dosage of DDT (4.0\%), malathion
   (5.0\%) and deltamethrin (0.05\%) for one hour. Mortality was recorded
   at 24 h after the exposure. The test mortality was corrected to the
   control mortality.
   Results: An. fluviatilis was susceptible to the three insecticides
   tested while, An. culicifacies was resistant to DDT and malathion in all
   the 10 districts except in two, where its response against malathion was
   under `verification required' category. Against deltamethrin, An.
   culicifacies was susceptible in two districts; while in the other eight
   districts its response was under `verification required' category.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Since An. fluviatilis the vector species
   primarily associated with transmission of malaria, was still susceptible
   to DDT, indoor residual spraying with DDT could be continued in the 10
   districts. Also, in view of the large scale implementation of long
   lasting insecticidal nets and the signs of development of resistance in
   An. culicifacies to deltamethrin, response of the vectors to synthetic
   pyrethroids needs to be periodically monitored.}},

Title = {{No Evidence for Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission in Big Cities Affected
   by Conflict Related Rural-Urban Migration in Sierra Leone and Liberia}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background In West Africa, the principal vectors of lymphatic filariasis
   (LF) are Anopheles species with Culex species playing only a minor role
   in transmission, if any. Being a predominantly rural disease, the
   question remains whether conflict-related migration of rural populations
   into urban areas would be sufficient for active transmission of the
   parasite.
   Methodology/Principal Findings We examined LF transmission in urban
   areas in post-conflict Sierra Leone and Liberia that experienced
   significant rural-urban migration. Mosquitoes from Freetown and
   Monrovia, were analyzed for infection with Wuchereria bancrofti. We also
   undertook a transmission assessment survey (TAS) in Bo and Pujehun
   districts in Sierra Leone. The majority of the mosquitoes collected were
   Culex species, while Anopheles species were present in low numbers. The
   mosquitoes were analyzed in pools, with a maximum of 20 mosquitoes per
   pool. In both countries, a total of 1731 An. gambiae and 14342 Culex
   were analyzed for W. bancrofti, using the PCR. Two pools of Culex
   mosquitoes and 1 pool of An. gambiae were found infected from one
   community in Freetown. Pool screening analysis indicated a maximum
   likelihood of infection of 0.004 (95\% CI of 0.00012-0.021) and 0.015
   (95\% CI of 0.0018-0.052) for the An. gambiae and Culex respectively.
   The results indicate that An. gambiae is present in low numbers, with a
   microfilaria prevalence breaking threshold value not sufficient to
   maintain transmission. The results of the TAS in Bo and Pujehun also
   indicated an antigen prevalence of 0.19\% and 0.67\% in children,
   respectively. This is well below the recommended 2\% level for stopping
   MDA in Anopheles transmission areas, according to WHO guidelines.
   Conclusions We found no evidence for active transmission of LF in
   cities, where internally displaced persons from rural areas lived for
   many years during the more than 10 years conflict in Sierra Leone and
   Liberia.
   Author Summary There have been many arguments regarding the
   implementation of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) activities for
   elephantiasis control in urban areas, and especially in countries where
   the disease is mostly found in rural settings. Blanket MDA in
   implementation units in big cities, may be costly and unnecessary,
   without evidence for active transmission in urban areas. Over 1 million
   people were treated in Freetown during the first MDA carried out in
   2010. This represents hundreds of thousands dollars that may serve a
   better use in reducing the impact of elephantiasis in areas with
   established on-going transmission. This study was conducted to assess
   the evidence of transmission of elephantiasis in urban areas, as a
   result of rural to urban migration in West African countries that have
   experienced civil wars, and the displacement of people from rural to
   urban areas. The results showed that the main mosquitoes transmitting
   elephantiasis are in numbers not enough to support transmission. Testing
   of individuals also showed very few people to have infection. Together,
   the results show that elephantiasis infection in the urban areas, where
   the study was conducted, is not enough to justify the need for MDA in
   the national capitals. This study represents a strategy that can be
   adopted in many countries, to inform the decision for undertaking MDA
   activities in cities.}},

Abstract = {{Entomopathogenic bacteria to control mosquitoes are a promising
   environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides. In the
   present study, a novel mosquitocidal bacterium was isolated from marine
   soil collected from east coastal areas at Pondicherry (India). 16S rRNA
   gene sequence alignment depicted that this isolate belonged to Bacillus
   cereus VCRC-B520 (NCBI: KC-119192). Biochemical studies on bacterial
   growth, biomass, and toxin production have revealed that this strain
   could possibly be helpful in the production of a biopesticide in
   mosquito control. Toxicity assay with B. cereus against mosquito larvae
   has shown that the filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus, is more
   susceptible than the other two species (Anopheles stephensi and Aedes
   aegypti). The LC50 and LC90 values for C. quinquefasciatus were 0.30 and
   2.21 mg/L, respectively. No effect of B. cereus was found on nontargeted
   organisms. SDS-PAGE analysis and protein purification result from the
   cell mass of B. cereus have shown that a well-perceptible polypeptide
   was the dependable factor (85 kDa) for mosquitocidal action. Protein
   characterization (M/S MALDI-TOF) has shown that it is an
   endotoxin-specific insecticidal protein, namely ``Cry4Aa{''}.
   Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gene sequence from this marine isolate
   have revealed the presence of homology among closely related Bacillus
   strains. Therefore, considerable interest has been shown on the
   identification of a potential mosquitocidal bacterium from marine
   environment (B. cereus), which was not reported earlier in view of the
   current scenario of the rapid development of resistance to Bacillus
   sphaericus in mosquito vector control program.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: A new irrigation canal system is under
   construction in Dhenkanal district of Odisha, to increase the production
   of rice crop and thereby improve the living standard of farmers in the
   project area. Construction of canal may increase the transmission of
   malaria by creating vector breeding habitats. Knowledge about bionomics
   of vectors will support authorities for appropriate management of the
   disease in a changing ecological set up. The aim of this study was to
   assess the malaria transmission in the bank of the canal area under
   construction.
   Methods: The entomological survey was carried out in three seasons,
   winter, summer and rainy during the period November 2008 October 2010 in
   the study area. Adult mosquitoes were collected by using suction tubes
   and flash lights. Mosquito species identification was done by using
   standard keys, separated according to abdominal conditions and were kept
   in an isopropanol for further molecular analysis of sibling species,
   presence of sporozoites and human blood meal. Larvae were collected by
   dippers and reared in the laboratory, and the emerged adults were
   identified to species. The epidemiology of malaria was evaluated from
   the data collected by the State Health Department. Insecticide
   succeptibility test was done by WHO method.
   Results: The adult mosquito collection from the study area showed the
   prevalence of 14 species belonging to three genera, i.e. Anopheles,
   Culex and Aedes. The per man hour densities (PMHD) of An. culicifacies
   were 3.8, 1.4, 4.8; that of An. annularis were 2.1, 1, 2.1; and that of
   An. fluviatilis were 1.4, 0.3, 0.6 during winter, summer and rainy
   seasons respectively. Sibling species identified were: An. culicifacies
   A, B, C and D, An. annularis A and An. fluviatilis S. Sporozoite rates
   of An. culicifacies A and C were 1.1 and 0.5\% respectively and that of
   An. annularis A was 2\% (reported for the first time in the state). Both
   the vectors (An. culicifacies and An. annularis) showed resistance to
   DDT and malathion and were susceptible to deltamethrin, whereas An.
   fluviatilis was susceptible to all the three insecticides tested.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Anopheles culicifacies, An. fluviatilis
   and An. annularis were prevalent in all the three seasons. The
   artificial ponds and seepage pools of canal are the major breeding sites
   for An. culicifacies and An. annularis. Thus, in the canal command area,
   control of malaria transmission requires use of insecticidetreated
   bednets and use of biolarvicides (seepage pools) and larvivorous fish
   (artificial ponds) wherever feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This article validates the note on the developmental biology of a
   mosquito (possibly an anopheline taxon) under the title On the
   metamorphoses of the mosquito' by William Gilchrist, a medical officer
   attached to the Madras Medical Establishment, Madras, India, which was
   published in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science in 1836. In
   today's context, Gilchrist's observations arouse interest given that
   they were made in Hoonsoor (now Hunsur', Karnataka, 12 degrees 1827N, 76
   degrees 1716E), a remote village (town?) in the Madras Presidency in the
   1820s, when magnifying optical instruments were crude and primitive even
   in Europe. Gilchrist's notes gain in validity especially because he made
   the observations approximately six decades before Ronald Ross
   established the connection between the mosquito and malaria. Scientific
   monographs and papers on Indian mosquitoes of early twentieth century
   are those of George Giles, who started his studies with Ronald Ross in
   Calcutta at the turn of the nineteenth century. Gilchrist's note
   precedes the work of Giles, but does not figure in Giles's papers and
   monographs, published nearly seven decades later.}},

Title = {{DDT \& deltamethrin resistance status of known Japanese encephalitis
   vectors in Assam, India}},
Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{988-994}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objective: Japanese encephalitis (JE) outbreaks are common
   in Assam, northeastern State of India. Information on resistance in
   known JE vectors in the affected area is important for effective control
   measures. This study was undertaken to determine the species abundance
   of JE vectors endemic to Sibsagar district of Assam, and their
   susceptibility against DDT and deltamethrin.
   Methods: Adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC light trap and
   aspirators from human dwellings from 13 endemic villages falling under
   three Primary Health Centres. Collected mosquitoes were identified and
   unfed female mosquitoes were used for DDT and deltamethrin sensitivity
   bioassay. The bioassay was performed following WHO protocol using
   standard susceptibility test kit. Knockdown time (KDT) was monitored at
   every 10 minutes intervals, whereas mortalities were recorded 24 h
   post-exposure. Vector density and resistance status were mapped using
   geographic information system (GIS) technique.
   Results: A total of 7655 mosquitoes were sampled under three genera,
   i.e. Anopheles, Culex and Mansonia, and nine species, the JE vector Cx.
   vishnui group (31.78\%) was the most predominant species, followed by
   Ma. uniformis (16.81\%) and Ma. indiana (16.45\%). All vector species
   were suspected to be resistant to DDT and sensitive to deltamethrin,
   except Ma. indiana, which was suspected to deltamethrin resistant. The
   KDT50 and KDT95 values of vector mosquitoes for DDT were significantly
   higher as compared to deltamethrin. The probit model used to estimate
   KDT50 and KDT95 values did not display normal distribution of percentage
   knockdown with time for all the vectors tested for DDT and deltamethrin,
   except for Ma. indiana for deltamethrin assay and Cx. gelidus for the
   DDT assay.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Differences in insecticide resistance
   status were observed between insecticides and vector species. The
   results of this study provided baseline data on insecticide resistance
   in known JE vectors of Sibsagar, Assam. The maps generated may allow
   better communication in control operations and comparison of changes in
   susceptibility status of these vectors over time.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies, a major malarial vector has been
   recognized as a complex of five sibling species, A, B, C, D and E. These
   sibling species exhibit varied vectorial capacity, host specificity and
   susceptibility to malarial parasites/insecticides. In this study, a PCR
   assay developed earlier for distinguishing the five individual species
   was validated on samples of An. culicifacies collected from various
   parts of India.
   Methods: The samples were initially screened using the rDNA-ITS2 region
   based primers which categorised the samples into either A/D group or
   B/C/E group. A proportion of samples belonging to each group were
   subjected to the mtDNA-COII PCR assay for identifying individual
   species.
   Results: Among the 615 samples analysed by rDNA-ITS2 PCR assay, 303 were
   found to belong to A/D group and 299 to B/C/E group while 13 turned
   negative. Among 163 samples belonging to A/D group, only one sample
   displayed the profile characteristic of species A and among the 176
   samples falling in the B/C/E group, 51 were identified as species B, 14
   as species C and 41 as species E respectively by the mtDNA-COII PCR
   assay. Samples exhibiting products diagnostic of B/C/E, when subjected
   to PCR-RFLP assay identified 15 samples as species E.
   Conclusion: Validation of the mtDNA-COII PCR assay on large number of
   samples showed that this technique cannot be used universally to
   distinguish the 5 members of this species complex, as it has been
   designed based on minor/single base differences observed in the COII
   region.}},

Title = {{y Midgut Microbial Community of Culex quinquefasciatus Mosquito
   Populations from India}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{The mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus is a ubiquitous species that serves
   as a major vector for west nile virus and lymphatic filariasis.
   Ingestion of bloodmeal by females triggers a series of physiological
   processes in the midgut and also exposes them to infection by these
   pathogens. The bacteria normally harbored in the midgut are known to
   influence physiology and can also alter the response to various
   pathogens. The midgut bacteria in female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes
   collected over a large geographical area from India was studied.
   Examination of 16S ribosomal DNA amplicons from culturable microflora
   revealed the presence of 83 bacterial species belonging to 31 bacterial
   genera. All of these species belong to three phyla i.e. Proteobacteria,
   Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Phylum Proteobacteria was the most
   dominant phylum (37 species), followed by Firmicutes (33 species) and
   Actinobacteria (13 species). Phylum Proteobacteria, was dominated by
   members of gamma-proteobacteria class. The genus Staphylococcus was the
   largest genus represented by 11 species whereas Enterobacter was the
   most prevalent genus and recovered from all the field stations except
   Leh. Highest bacterial prevalence was observed from Bhuj (22 species)
   followed by Nagrota (18 species), Masimpur (18 species) and Hathigarh
   (16 species). Whereas, least species were observed from Leh (8 species).
   It has been observed that individual mosquito harbor extremely diverse
   gut bacteria and have very small overlap bacterial taxa in their gut.
   This variation in midgut microbiota may be one of the factors
   responsible for variation in disease transmission rates or vector
   competence within mosquito population. The present data strongly
   encourage further investigations to verify the potential role of the
   detected bacteria in mosquito for the transmission of lymphatic
   filariasis and west nile virus. To the best of our knowledge this is the
   first study on midgut microbiota of wild Cx. quinquefasciatus from over
   a large geographical area.}},

Title = {{Ultra low concentration deltamethrin loaded patch development and
   evaluation of its repellency against dengue vector Aedes (S) albopictus}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mosquito repellents and emanators confer protection against
   mosquito bites through spatial action of emanated vapours which are
   released into the adjoining environment. Synthetic insecticides released
   into the environment in ultra low volume vapour phase deter the
   mosquitoes from biting humans in a protected space.
   Methods: Formulation patches were prepared using the solvent evaporation
   method over a backing membrane and using Dibutylphthalate (DBT) as a
   plasticizer. The effect of formulation variables on the deltamethrin
   release from the patch matrices were studied under accelerated
   conditions, whereas, HPLC was used for quantitative estimation of
   deltamethrin. The prepared patch formulations were subjected to
   physicochemical studies, such as, deltamethrin content, thickness,
   weight variation, percent moisture content, moisture uptake, surface
   area and surface pH determination. Deltamethrin-polymer interaction and
   compatibility was ascertained using DSC and FT-IR, while surface
   morphology and deltamethrin distribution in the patch were studied using
   SEM technique. Repellent activity of the patch formulations was
   evaluated against Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.
   Results: Blends of polymeric combinations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
   and ethyl-cellulose (EC) with admixture of deltamethrin provided
   prolonged repellent activity against Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.
   Physicochemical characterisation indicated the suitability of
   deltamethrin patch formulation with the polymeric combinations of PVP
   and EC. Patches were very effective against laboratory reared Ae.
   albopictus mosquitoes. No significant difference was observed between
   the performance of test patches and commercially available repellent
   cream Mosqshield (R).
   Conclusion: Deltamethrin loaded patches provided effective repellency
   against Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. The study emphasised that
   deltamethrin released to the environment in low concentration could be
   an excellent spatial repellent against hematophagous mosquitoes.}},

Title = {{Comparative Susceptibility of Different Biological Forms of Anopheles
   stephensi to Plasmodium berghei ANKA Strain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are varying degrees of compatibility between malaria
   parasite-mosquito species, and understanding this compatibility may be
   crucial for developing effective transmission-blocking vaccines. This
   study investigates the compatibility of different biological forms of a
   malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, to Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain.
   Methods: Several biologically different and allopatric forms of A.
   stephensi were studied. Three forms were isolated from different regions
   of southern Iran: the variety mysorensis, the intermediate form and the
   native type form, and an additional type form originated from India
   (Beech strain). The mosquitoes were experimentally infected with P.
   berghei to compare their susceptibility to parasitism. Anti-mosquito
   midgut antiserum was then raised in BALB/cs mice immunized against gut
   antigens from the most susceptible form of A. stephensi (Beech strain),
   and the efficacy of the antiserum was assessed in transmission-blocking
   assays conducted on the least susceptible mosquito biological form.
   Results: The susceptibility of different biological forms of A.
   stephensi mosquito to P. berghei was specifically inter-type varied. The
   Beech strain and the intermediate form were both highly susceptible to
   infection, with higher oocyst and sporozoite infection rates than
   intermediate and mysorensis forms. The oocyst infection, and
   particularly sporozite infection, was lowest in the mysorensis strain.
   Antiserum raised against midgut proteins of the Indian Beech type form
   blocked infection in this mosquito population, but it was ineffective at
   blocking both oocyst and sporozoite development in the permissive but
   geographically distant intermediate form mosquitoes. This suggests that
   a strong degree of incompatibility exists between the mosquito strains
   in terms of midgut protein(s) acting as putative ookinete receptors.
   Conclusions: The incompatibility in the midgut protein profiles between
   two biological forms of A. stephensi demonstrates a well-differentiated
   population structure according to geographical origin. Therefore, the
   design of potential transmission-blocking strategies should incorporate
   a more thorough understanding of intra-species variations in
   host-parasite interactions.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of New Tools for Malaria Vector Control in Cameroon: Focus on
   Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: From 2006 to 2011, biological activity of insecticides for
   Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), conventional treatment of nets (CTNs) or
   long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was evaluated before their
   approval in Cameroon. The objective of the study was to select the best
   tools for universal malaria vector control coverage.
   Methodology: Bioassays were performed using WHO cones and the Kisumu
   susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae s.s.. Among tested products,
   residual activity and wash resistance of Alpha-cypermethrin LLINs
   (Interceptor) and CTNs (Fendona) were assessed during 5 months in the
   Ntougou neighborhood.
   Principal Findings: All the 14 tested products were found effective
   (95-100\% knockdown and mortality rates), although a significant
   decrease of efficacy was seen with lambda-cyhalothrinWP IRS,
   alpha-cypermethrin CTNs and LLINs (p< 0.05). However, the efficacy of
   Interceptor nets did not decrease during the 5 months evaluation, even
   after 25 washes (0.07<p<0.9). Meanwhile Fendona SC nets displayed a
   drastic decrease of activity after 5 washes, odds ratio was 3.07
   (1.0-8.59).
   Conclusion: This study provided useful data for decision making and
   community education toward universal coverage of malaria vector control

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: An epidemiological and entomological study was carried out
   in Balaghat district, Madhya Pradesh, India to understand the dynamics
   of forest malaria transmission in a difficult and hard to reach area
   where indoor residual spray and insecticide treated nets were used for
   vector control.
   Methods: This community based cross-sectional study was undertaken from
   January 2010 to December 2012 in Baihar and Birsa Community Health
   Centres of district Balaghat for screening malaria cases. Entomological
   surveillance included indoor resting collections, pyrethrum spray
   catches and light trap catches. Anophelines were assayed by ELISA for
   detection of Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein.
   Findings: Plasmodium falciparum infection accounted for >80\% of all
   infections. P. vivax 16.5\%, P. malariae 0.75\% and remaining were mixed
   infections of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae. More than, 30\%
   infections were found in infants under 6 months of age. Overall, an
   increasing trend in malaria positivity was observed from 2010 to 2012
   (chi-square for trend = 663.55; P<0.0001). Twenty five Anopheles
   culicifacies (sibling species C, D and E) were positive for
   circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum (44\%) and P. vivax (56\%).
   Additionally, 2 An. fluviatilis, were found positive for P. falciparum
   and 1 for P. vivax (sibling species S and T). An. fluviatilis sibling
   species T was found as vector in forest villages for the first time in
   India.
   Conclusion: These results showed that the study villages are
   experiencing almost perennial malaria transmission inspite of indoor
   residual spray and insecticide treated nets. Therefore, there is a need
   for new indoor residual insecticides which has longer residual life or
   complete coverage of population with long lasting insecticide treated
   nets or both indoor residual spray and long lasting bed nets for
   effective vector control. There is a need to undertake a well designed
   case control study to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: The relationship between altitude, temperature
   and malaria are poorly understood. Hence, a study was undertaken at
   three sites of Udham Singh Nagar (erstwhile Nainital district) and
   Nainital district (Uttarakhand) during 2010-11 for the generation of
   evidences in the context of potential threat of climate change.
   Methods: Data on temperature and relative humidity (RH) were recorded
   through data-logger device in study villages at the altitudes of 166,
   226 and 609 m were selected for detailed work. Mosquito collections were
   made fortnightly during 0600-0800 hrs. Malaria incidence data were
   procured from concerned Primary Health Centres.
   Results: The study provides evidences of decrease in temperature with
   increase in altitude, even within a district resulting in variation in
   temporal distribution of malaria vector. With the increase of 67 m
   altitude between plains and foothill village, there was a reduction in
   temperature to the tune of 1.1 degrees C and with further increase in
   altitude of 416 m between foothill and hilly villages, the temperature
   decreased by 0.27 degrees C. The difference in temperature at three
   altitudes affects the Transmission windows (TWs) of both Plasmodium
   vivax (Pv) and P falciparum (Pf), and opening of TWs are inversely
   proportional to altitude. In the plains, the TW for Pv and Pf were open
   for 11 and 10 months respectively, while 10 and 9 months in the
   foothills and 9 and 8 months, respectively for both the parasites at
   hilly altitude. Comparison of malaria vectors in plains, foothills, and
   hilly villages showed that the availability of Anopheles culicifacies
   and An. fluviatilis decreased with an increase in altitude from
   foothills to hilly areas.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: This study may be extrapolated to know the
   suitability of occurrence of malaria vectors and transmission of
   parasites at different altitudes from the viewpoint of temperature as
   limiting factor in unknown areas.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-two Bacillus sphaericus strains were isolated from soil around
   Tamil Nadu, India. The phylogenetic relationship among the B. sphaericus
   isolates was analysed by REP-PCR and multiplex PCR was performed for the
   detection of mosquito larvicidal genes binA, binB, mtx1, mtx2 and mtx3
   in B. sphaericus isolates. According to the REP-PCR band pattern, B.
   sphaericus isolates were divided into group A comprising I-XI clusters
   and group B comprising cluster XII. Three of the isolates BSTN01, 23 and
   24 were gathered under cluster XII showed a high level of larvicidal
   activity against Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi, the
   other 39 isolates grouped under I-XI clusters were non-toxic or weak or
   moderately toxic to mosquito larvae. Even though BSTN23 and 24 were
   isolated from the same location and both contained all the five mosquito
   larvicidal genes, their intraspecies difference was clearly elucidated
   by REP-PCR analysis. Among high toxic isolates, BSTN23 and 24 were
   observed to contain all the five toxin genes and BSTN01 showed the
   presence of binary toxin and Mtx1 toxin genes. The isolates BSTN02, 03,
   07, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 25, 31, 36 and 39 were found to contain mtxl
   gene with combination of mtx2 and/or mtx3 showed moderate or low
   toxicity against mosquito larvae. binA, binB and mtxl genes were not
   present in non-toxic isolates. The present study revealed the genetic
   heterogeneity between both toxic and non-toxic isolates and indicates
   that there is a good correlation between the presence of toxin genes and
   toxicity of the strains. These techniques could be developed in
   screening of novel highly toxic B. sphaericus strains from environment
   without bioassay on mosquito larvae. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Molecular characterization and identification of members of the

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato is a major malaria vector in
   South and Southeast Asia. Based initially on polytene chromosome
   inversion polymorphism, and subsequently on morphological
   characterization, four sibling species A-D were reported from India. The
   present study uses molecular methods to further characterize and
   identify sibling species in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: Mosquitoes from Sri Lanka were morphologically identified to
   species and sequenced for the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-2
   (ITS2) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit-I (COI) genes.
   These sequences, together with others from GenBank, were used to
   construct phylogenetic trees and parsimony haplotype networks and to
   test for genetic population structure.
   Results: Both ITS2 and COI sequences revealed two divergent clades
   indicating that the Subpictus complex in Sri Lanka is composed of two
   genetically distinct species that correspond to species A and species B
   from India. Phylogenetic analysis showed that species A and species B do
   not form a monophyletic clade but instead share genetic similarity with
   Anopheles vagus and Anopheles sundaicus s.l., respectively. An allele
   specific identification method based on ITS2 variation was developed for
   the reliable identification of species A and B in Sri Lanka.
   Conclusion: Further multidisciplinary studies are needed to establish
   the species status of all chromosomal forms in the Subpictus complex.
   This study emphasizes the difficulties in using morphological characters
   for species identification in An. subpictus s.l. in Sri Lanka and
   demonstrates the utility of an allele specific identification method
   that can be used to characterize the differential bio-ecological traits
   of species A and B in Sri Lanka.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the larvicidal and pupicidal activities of
   aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Catharanthus roseus (C.
   roseus) against malaria and filariasis vectors. Methods: The larvicidal
   and pupicidal activities of C. roseus leaf extracts were tested against
   the fourth instar larvae and pupae of Anopheles stephensi (An.
   stephensi) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus). The
   mortality was observed after 24 and 48 h post the treatment. The data
   were subjected to probit analysis to determine the lethal concentrations
   (LC50 and LC90) at which 50\% and 90\% of the treated larvae or pupae of
   the tested species were killed. Results: The larval and pupal mortality
   were observed after 24 and 48 h of exposure of aqueous, ethyl acetate
   and methanol extracts of C. roseus; no mortality was observed in the
   control group. The LC50 values against the fourth-instar larvae of An.
   stephensi were 68.62 and 72.04 mg/mL for the aqueous extract, 82.47
   mg/mL for the ethyl acetate extract, and 78.80 and 86.64 mg/mL for the

Abstract = {{Objective To identify the Anopheles culicifacies sibling species complex
   and study their vectorial role in malaria endemic regions of Odisha.
   Methods Mosquitoes were collected from 6 malaria endemic districts using
   standard entomological collection methods. An.culicifacies sibling
   species were identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   using cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) region of mitochondrial DNA.
   Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite rate and human blood fed
   percentage (HBF) were estimated by PCR using Pf- and human-specific
   primers. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed to confirm
   the type of sibling species of An.culicifacies found in Odisha. Results
   Multiplex PCR detected An.culicifacies sibling species A, B, C, D and E
   in the malaria endemic regions of Odisha. An.culicifacies E was detected
   for the first time in Odisha, which was further confirmed by molecular
   phylogenetics. Highest sporozoite rate and HBF percentage were observed
   in An.culicifacies E in comparison with other sibling species.
   An.culicifacies E collected from Nawarangapur, Nuapara and Keonjhar
   district showed high HBF percentage and sporozoite rates. Conclusion
   An.culicifacies B was the most abundant species, followed by
   An.culicifacies C and E. High sporozoite rate and HBF of An.culicifacies
   E indicated that it plays an important role in malaria transmission in
   Odisha. Appropriate control measures against An.culicifacies E at an
   early stage are needed to prevent further malaria transmission in
   Odisha.}},

Title = {{Sequential Modelling of the Effects of Mass Drug Treatments on
   Anopheline-Mediated Lymphatic Filariasis Infection in Papua New Guinea}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) has been targeted by the WHO for
   global eradication leading to the implementation of large scale
   intervention programs based on annual mass drug administrations (MDA)
   worldwide. Recent work has indicated that locality-specific
   bio-ecological complexities affecting parasite transmission may
   complicate the prediction of LF extinction endpoints, casting
   uncertainty on the achievement of this initiative. One source of
   difficulty is the limited quantity and quality of data used to
   parameterize models of parasite transmission, implying the important
   need to update initially-derived parameter values. Sequential analysis
   of longitudinal data following annual MDAs will also be important to
   gaining new understanding of the persistence dynamics of LF. Here, we
   apply a Bayesian statistical-dynamical modelling framework that enables
   assimilation of information in human infection data recorded from
   communities in Papua New Guinea that underwent annual MDAs, into our
   previously developed model of parasite transmission, in order to examine
   these questions in LF ecology and control.
   Results: Biological parameters underlying transmission obtained by
   fitting the model to longitudinal data remained stable throughout the
   study period. This enabled us to reliably reconstruct the observed
   baseline data in each community. Endpoint estimates also showed little
   variation. However, the updating procedure showed a shift towards higher
   and less variable values for worm kill but not for any other
   drug-related parameters. An intriguing finding is that the stability in
   key biological parameters could be disrupted by a significant reduction
   in the vector biting rate prevailing in a locality.
   Conclusions: Temporal invariance of biological parameters in the face of
   intervention perturbations indicates a robust adaptation of LF
   transmission to local ecological conditions. The results imply that
   understanding the mechanisms that underlie locally adapted transmission
   dynamics will be integral to identifying points of system fragility, and
   thus countermeasures to reliably facilitate LF extinction both locally
   and globally.}},

Title = {{Analysis of population genetic structure of Indian Anopheles
   culicifacies species A using microsatellite markers}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato is an important vector of
   malaria in Southeast Asia contributing to almost 70\% of malaria cases
   in India. It exists as morphologically similar sibling species A, B, C,
   D and E with varied geographical distribution patterns. Vector control
   measures have been difficult for this important vector as the sibling
   species have developed varying levels of resistance to the currently
   used insecticides. In view of the importance of this vector, we
   developed and validated a set of microsatellite markers and the same
   were used to analyze the population genetic structure of five different
   geographical populations of An. culicifacies A.
   Methods: Anopheles culicifacies A samples were collected from different
   localities across India, and genotyping was performed using eight
   microsatellite markers on ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. Several
   statistical analyses were performed to ascertain the genetic diversity
   that exists within and between the populations.
   Results: The markers were found to be moderately polymorphic in the
   populations. Genetic analysis indicated significant genetic
   differentiation between the majority of the population pairs analyzed
   and was not found to be related to the geographical distances between
   populations.
   Conclusion: This is the first and successful attempt to test the
   microsatellite markers developed for population genetic analysis of An.
   culicifacies A. Host feeding and breeding habits of species A suggest
   that factors other than ecological and geographical barriers were
   responsible for the genetic differentiation that has been observed
   between the populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 2009, 2589 mosquitoes were collected in northwest Italy and screened
   for orthobunyavirus RNA by RT-PCR. One pool of Anopheles maculipennis
   complex mosquitoes was found to be positive and a virus was isolated

   sequencing. Previously, BATV was detected in Italy, but limited data and
   no prior isolates existed. Full-length sequences of the S, M and L
   segments were determined for the newly isolated Italian strain. For
   comparison, partial sequences were also determined for the BATV strain
   Calovo (former Czechoslovakia, 1960). Phylogenetic analyses revealed
   clustering of the newly derived Italian BATV along with a recent isolate
   from Germany and the historic strain Calovo. To the best of our
   knowledge, this represents the first isolation of BATV from Italy, which
   confirms a broader geographical distribution of BATV in Europe than was
   previously verified by isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify the malaria hot spots at health subcentre level
   in an endemic district using a geographical information system (GIS).
   The results will be useful for rapid retrieval of malaria information,
   and to prioritize malaria control efforts in identified hot spots.
   Study design: Extraction, analysis and synthesis of relevant data.
   Methods: Malaria epidemiological data from 2006 to 2009 were analysed to
   determine the annual parasitic index, slide positivity rate, annual
   blood examination rate and Plasmodium falciparum percentage for each
   health subcentre in the district. Maps were produced using GIS, and
   integrated to identify the malaria hotspots.
   Results: Out of 288 health subcentres, GIS identified 10 hot spots at
   extremely high risk of malaria and 14 hot spots at high risk of malaria.
   Malaria may flare up in these hot spots whenever favourable transmission
   conditions arise. Health authorities have been advised to establish
   control measures in these selected hot spots for timely prevention.
   Conclusion: There is a need for adequate monitoring and allocation of
   available resources for better interventions in the malaria hotspots.
   The GIS model used in this study can be used, even at village or cluster
   level, to pin point the malaria hot spots, and information can be
   updated and retrieved easily. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public

Abstract = {{Background: Malaria still remains a public health problem in Iran. There
   are different vector control interventions such as insecticide spraying.
   The present study was carried out to determine the susceptibility status
   of Anopheles stephensi larvae to temephos as a national plan for
   monitoring and mapping of insecticide resistance
   Methods: Eight different localities in two main malarious provinces were
   determined as field collecting sites. Mosquitoes were collected from the
   field and reared in an insectray. Susceptibility assays were carried out
   according to the WHO method. The laboratory reared susceptible Beech-Lab
   strain was used for comparison. Data were analyzed using Probit analysis
   to determine LC50 and LC90 values.
   Results: Susceptibility of An. stephensi to temephos indicated that the
   LC50 ranged from 0.0022 mg/l to 0.0141 mg/l. Although all field strains
   were susceptible to temephos, considerable variations in temephos
   resistance ratios of field strains were noticed from all the localities
   studied in comparison with the susceptible strain. A low level of
   resistance ratio was noticed in An. stephensi populations except for the
   Chabahar strain (RR=4.27 fold). All field-collected An. stephensi
   populations exhibited homogeneity to the larvicide except for Bandar
   Abbas and Hormoodar village strains (P>0.05\%).
   Conclusion: Due to intensive use of temephos in the neighboring
   countries and occurrence of resistant to this insecticide in the main
   malaria vector in the region, insecticide resistance gene may evolve in
   the populations of An. stephensi. If temephos be applied as a larvicide
   it should be used judiciously for resistance management, as rotation
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: The Meghalaya region had been considered free
   of malaria, but recently malaria cases in the foothills and valley areas
   raised concern that malaria transmission at high elevations may be
   increasing. This increase is associated with land use and land cover
   (LULC) changes. This LULC directly modifies larval habitats and affect
   the anopheline larval distribution patterns.
   Methods: In this survey, effects of LULC changes on the distribution of
   anopheline larval habitats in Meghalaya over a three year period (April
   2008 to March 2011) was observed. Mosquito density and diversity of
   neighbouring four villages located along natural swamps (less disturbed)
   were compared with 16 villages located near disturbed area (cultivated
   area, urban area, pastures land area and national highway area).
   Results: The association between LULC type and occurrence of anopheline
   larvae was statistically significant. The distribution of anopheline
   positive habitats varied significantly between seasons. The mean density
   of Anopheles was significantly higher in urban area in all the seasons,
   but higher in farm land and pasture land areas only in rainy and
   post-rainy seasons. The six most common species collected were Anopheles
   maculatus (19.2\%), An. vagus (13.7\%), An. annularis (9.1\%), An.
   philippinensis (8.1\%), An. barbirostris (5.1\%) and An. minimus
   (4.6\%). LULC changes occurred mainly in valleys and National Highway
   Development Programme Phase III site. Overall, open forest area, farm
   land area and national highway development project phase area were
   observed to increase by 2.9, 1.7, and 2.1\% respectively.
   Interpretation and conclusion: Our results indicate that LULC changes in
   the study area were favourable to Anopheles larval development,
   increasing the risk of the spread of malaria vector habitats and malaria
   transmission to non-malarious regions of Meghalaya.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To determine the larvicidal activity of various extracts of Gymnema
   (G.) sylvestre against the Japanese Encephalitis vector, Culex
   tritaeniorynchus in Tamilnadu, India. To identify the active principle
   present in the promising fraction obtained in Chlorofom:Methanol extract
   of Fraction 2.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G. Sylvestre leaf extracts were tested,
   employing WHO procedure against fourth instar larvae of C.
   tritaeniorhynchus and the larval mortalities were recorded at various
   concentrations (6.25 microg/ml); the 24h LC50 values of the G. Sylvestre
   leaf extracts were determined following Probit analysis. It was
   noteworthy, that treatment level 100 ppm exhibited highest mortality
   rates for the three different crude extracts and was significantly
   different from the mean mortalities recorded for the other
   concentrations.
   RESULTS: The LC50 values of 34.756 microg/ml (24.475-51.41), 31.351
   microg/ml (20.634-47.043) and 28.577 microg/ml (25.159-32.308) were
   calculated in acetone, chloroform and methanol extract with the
   chi-square values of 10.301, 31.351 and 4.093 respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation proved that G. Sylvestre could be

   Plasmodium vinckei petteri by using Anopheles stephensi Liston as
   calibrator for variable infectivity in different isolates. An.
   stephensi, which was used as control, became readily infected, with
   60-65\% mosquitoes carrying developing oocysts, whereas in species T and
   species U, approximate to 50 and 63\%, respectively, of mosquitoes
   carried oocyts. An. fluviatilis species T was found comparatively less
   susceptible to P. v. petteri sporogonic development compared with
   species U. Moreover, significantly lesser sporozoites rate (11\%) was
   observed in species T compared with 31\% in species U. Species T and
   species U are not considered as malaria vectors in India in the field.

   medicinal plants from Eastern Ghats of South India have been extracted
   with ethyl acetate and assayed for growth inhibition of asexual
   erythrocytic stages of chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (3D7) and
   (CQ)-resistant (INDO) strains of P. falciparum in culture using the
   fluorescence-based SYBR Green I assay. Studied extracts showed a
   spectrum of antiplasmodial activities ranging from (a) very good (IC50 <
   10-10 mu g/mL: Cyperus rotundus and Zingiber officinale); (b) good
   (IC50, > 10-15 mu g/mL: Ficus religiosa and Murraya koenigii); (c)
   moderate (IC50 > 15-25 mu g/mL: Ficus benghalensis); (d) poor activity
   (IC50 > 25-60 mu g/mL) and (e) inactive (IC50 > 60 mu g/mL). Resistance
   indices ranging from 0.78 to 1.28 suggest that some of these extracts
   had equal promise against the CQ resistant INDO strain of P. falciparum.
   Cytotoxicity assessment of the extracts against HeLa cell line using MTT
   assay revealed that the selectivity indices in the range of 3-15
   suggesting a good margin of safety. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Anopheles fluviatilis, a major vector of malaria in India has been
   described as a complex of three sibling species members, named as S, T
   and U, based on variations in chromosomal inversions. Also, ribosomal
   DNA markers (repetitive Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and 28S D3
   region) were described to differentiate these three sibling species
   members. However, controversies prevail on the genetic isolation status
   of these cryptic species. Hence, we evaluated this taxonomic
   incongruence employing DNA barcoding, the well established methodology
   for species identification, using 60 An. fluviatilis sensu lato
   specimens, collected from two malaria endemic eastern states of India.
   These specimens were also subjected to sibling species characterization
   by ITS2 and D3 DNA markers. The former marker identified 31 specimens
   among these as An. fluviatilis S and 21 as An. fluviatilis T. Eight
   specimens amplified DNA fragments specific for both S and T. The D3
   marker characterized 39 specimens belonging to species S and 21 to
   species T. Neither marker identified species U. Neighbor Joining
   analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene 1 sequences (the DNA
   barcode) categorized all the 60 specimens into a single operational
   taxonomic unit, their Kimura 2 parameter (K2P) genetic variability being
   only 0.8\%. The genetic differentiation (FST) and gene flow (Nm)
   estimates were 0.00799 and 62.07, respectively, indicating these two
   species' (S \& T) as genetically con-specific intermixing populations
   with negligible genetic differentiation. Earlier investigations have
   refuted the existence of species U. Also, this study demonstrated that
   An. fluviatilis and the closely related An. minimus could be
   taxonomically differentiated by the DNA Barcode approach (K2P=5.0\%).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Environmental temperature is an important driver of malaria
   transmission dynamics. Both the parasite and vector are sensitive to
   mean ambient temperatures and daily temperature variation. To understand
   transmission ecology, therefore, it is important to determine the range
   of microclimatic temperatures experienced by malaria vectors in the
   field.
   Methods: A pilot study was conducted in the Indian city of Chennai to
   determine the temperature variation in urban microclimates and
   characterize the thermal ecology of the local transmission setting.
   Temperatures were measured in a range of probable indoor and outdoor
   resting habitats of Anopheles stephensi in two urban slum malaria sites.
   Mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations in local
   transmission sites were compared with standard temperature measures from
   the local weather station. The biological implications of the different
   temperatures were explored using temperature-dependent parasite
   development models to provide estimates of the extrinsic incubation
   period (EIP) of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.
   Results: Mean daily temperatures within the urban transmission sites
   were generally warmer than those recorded at the local weather station.
   The main reason was that night-time temperatures were higher (and hence
   diurnal temperature ranges smaller) in the urban settings. Mean
   temperatures and temperature variation also differed between specific
   resting sites within the transmission environments. Most differences
   were of the order of 1-3 degrees C but were sufficient to lead to
   important variation in predicted EIPs and hence, variation in estimates
   of transmission intensity.
   Conclusions: Standard estimates of environmental temperature derived
   from local weather stations do not necessarily provide realistic
   measures of temperatures within actual transmission environments. Even
   the small differences in mean temperatures or diurnal temperature ranges
   reported in this study can lead to large variations in key mosquito
   and/or parasite life history traits that determine transmission
   intensity. Greater effort should be directed at quantifying adult
   mosquito resting behaviour and determining the temperatures actually
   experienced by mosquitoes and parasites in local transmission
   environments. In the absence of such highly resolved data, the approach
   used in the current study provides a framework for improved thermal
   characterization of transmission settings.}},

Abstract = {{Insects are a class of living creatures within the arthropods. Insect
   bite reactions are commonly seen in clinical practice. The present
   review touches upon the medically important insects and their places in
   the classification, the sparse literature on the epidemiology of insect
   bites in India, and different variables influencing the susceptibility
   of an individual to insect bites. Clinical features of mosquito bites,
   hypersensitivity to mosquito bites Epstein-Barr virus NK (HMB-EBV-NK)
   disease, eruptive pseudoangiomatosis, Skeeter syndrome, papular pruritic
   eruption of HIV/AIDS, and clinical features produced by bed bugs,
   Mexican chicken bugs, assassin bugs, kissing bugs, fleas, black flies,
   Blandford flies, louse flies, tsetse flies, midges, and thrips are
   discussed. Brief account is presented of the immunogenic components of
   mosquito and bed bug saliva. Papular urticaria is discussed including
   its epidemiology, the 5 stages of skin reaction, the SCRATCH principle
   as an aid in diagnosis, and the recent evidence supporting participation
   of types I, III, and IV hypersensitivity reactions in its causation is
   summarized. Recent developments in the treatment of pediculosis capitis
   including spinosad 0.9\% suspension, benzyl alcohol 5\% lotion,
   dimethicone 4\% lotion, isopropyl myristate 50\% rinse, and other
   suffocants are discussed within the context of evidence derived from
   randomized controlled trials and key findings of a recent systematic
   review. We also touch upon a non-chemical treatment of head lice and the
   ineffectiveness of egg-loosening products. Knockdown resistance (kdr) as
   the genetic mechanism making the lice nerves insensitive to permethrin
   is discussed along with the surprising contrary clinical evidence from
   Europe about efficacy of permethrin in children with head lice carrying
   kdr-like gene. The review also presents a brief account of insects as
   vectors of diseases and ends with discussion of prevention of insect
   bites and some serious adverse effects of mosquito coil smoke.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquito-borne diseases in India, e.g., malaria, dengue, chikungunya,
   filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis cause thousands of deaths per
   year. Mosquito control is to enhance the health and quality of life of
   county residents and visitors through the reduction of mosquito
   populations. Mosquito control is of serious concern in developing
   countries like India due to the lack of general awareness, development
   of resistance, and socioeconomic reasons. Noble metal nanoparticles have
   been used because of their unique optical properties; especially gold
   and silver have a broad absorption band in the visible region of
   electromagnetic spectrum. Synthesis of gold nanoparticles using
   Cymbopogan citratus is an ecofriendly approach for safer environment. C.
   citratus leaf broth was a good reducing agent that converted chloroauric
   acid (HAuCl4) to metal gold and further heating converted it into
   nanoparticles. Characterization using UV spectrophotometer, X-ray
   diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, particle size
   analyzer, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the
   particles are gold nanoparticles ranging between 10 and 110 nm with an
   average particles size of 20 nm. Further biosynthesized gold
   nanoparticles and Anthocephalus cadamba were experimented for the
   larvicidal effect on the filarial vector, Culex quinquefasciatus.
   Results showed that the gold nanoparticles are much toxic than the plant
   extract. Observed lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) were 1.08 and
   2.76 ppm for gold nanoparticles and 21.82 and 79.52 ppm for the third
   instar of C. quinquefasciatus.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes are insect vectors responsible for the transmission of
   parasitic and viral infections to millions of people worldwide, with
   substantial morbidity and mortality. Infections transmitted by
   mosquitoes include malaria, yellow fever, chikungunya, filariasis and
   other arboviruses. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
   suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The
   adulticidal activities of crude hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone
   and methanol leaf extracts of Acalypha alnifolia were assayed for their
   toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Aedes aegypti,
   Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. The adult mortality was
   observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate adulticide
   effects; however, the highest adult mortality was found in methanol
   extract were observed. The LC50 values of A. alnifolia leaf extracts
   against adulticidal activity of (hexane, benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone
   and methanol) A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus were the
   following: A. aegypti values were 371.87, 342.97, 320.17, 300.86 and
   279.75 ppm; A. stephensi values were 358.35, 336.64, 306.10, 293.01 and
   274.76 ppm; C. quinquefasciatus values were 383.59, 354.13, 327.74,
   314.33 and 291.71 ppm. The results of the repellent activity of hexane,
   benzene, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol extract of A. alnifolia
   plant at three different concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/cm(2)
   were applied on skin of forearm in man and exposed against adult female
   mosquitoes. In this observation, this plant crude extracts gave
   protection against mosquito bites without any allergic reaction to the
   test person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent on the
   strength of the plant extracts. Mean percent hatchability of the
   ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post-treatment. The percent
   hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract
   and directly proportional to the eggs. Mortality of 100 \% with methanol
   extract of A. alnifolia was exerted at 125 and 300 ppm. The larval
   density was decreased after the treatment of plant extracts at the
   breeding sites (water bodies system) of vector mosquitoes, and hence,
   these plant extracts are suitable alternatives of synthetic insecticides
   for mosquito vector management.These results suggest that the leaf
   solvent plant extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal
   eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquitoes. This study provides
   first report on the mosquito ovicidal, repellent and adulticidal
   activities of these plant extracts against mosquito vector species from
   India.}},

Abstract = {{In rubber plantations, tree holes are one of the major types of breeding
   habitats of Aedes mosquitoes which transmit dengue and chikungunya. A
   mermithid nematode, Romanomermis iyengari, was evaluated in tree holes
   for its efficacy in controlling Aedes albopictus. Infection of mosquito
   larvae by the nematode was determined through microscopic examination on
   the next day of application, and evaluation of immature density of
   mosquito was done on the seventh day. After application of the infective
   stage of the nematode in a host-parasite ratio of 1:3 or 1:4, the
   infection rates on the different larval instars of mosquito were
   similar, 85.7-95.8 \% in first to third instars and 79.3 \% in fourth
   instar larvae or 100 and 92.9 \%, respectively. Parasite burden varied
   from 1.1 to 2.4, respectively, among first and third instar larvae
   applied at 1:3. At 1:4, the parasite burden was between 1.6 (fourth
   instar) and 4 (second instar). The increase in parasite burden due to
   parasite density was significant in all the larval instars (P < 0.05).
   High parasite burden is detrimental to parasite recycling as it can
   cause premature mortality of the host. Hence, the dosage of 1:3 could be
   considered as suitable for rubber tree hole habitats. In the
   nematode-applied tree holes, there was a significant level (P < 0.05) of
   reduction in the immature density of A. albopictus, especially late
   instars and pupae, confirming the efficacy of R. iyengari in infecting
   the mosquito and controlling pupal emergence.}},

Abstract = {{In Mizoram, the origin and molecular nature of Anopheles species is
   poorly understood, despite the region having high malarial incidence and
   rich biodiversity. A diagnostic PCR assay for distinguishing the Cellia
   subgenera members of Anopheles species was developed based on the
   interspecific ITS2 variation. No intraspecific variation was found and
   the size (362-604 bp) and GC content (48.8-58.9\%) of the ITS2 were
   highly variable among Anophelines. The ITS2 of A. vagus is significantly
   longer than those of other Anopheles species. Significant relationship
   was observed among repeats, minimum free energy and RNA secondary
   structures. Different types of microsatellites were identified and among
   them dinucleotide, pentanucleotide and polynucleotide microsatellites
   were predominant. Variation in the length of the ITS2 between species
   was due to indels in simple repeats. Four domain types of RNA secondary
   structures were identified and the lowest free energy values were
   predicted using the computer software, RNAfold. Types I and II were
   observed only in Neocellia and Myzomyia series and Types III and IV were
   common in Neocellia and Pyretophorus series. ITS2-based PCR protocol
   provides a means for vector ecologists, malaria epidemiologists and
   control personnel to accurately identify members of the subgenera Cellia
   and a better understanding of their genomic status in Mizoram. (C) 2012

Title = {{The Impact of Artemisinin Combination Therapy and Long-Lasting
   Insecticidal Nets on Forest Malaria Incidence in Tribal Villages of
   India, 2006-2011}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: New tools for malaria control, artemisinin combination
   therapy (ACT) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were recently
   introduced across India. We estimated the impact of universal coverage
   of ACT and ACT plus LLINs in a setting of hyperendemic, forest malaria
   transmission.
   Methods: We reviewed data collected through active and passive case
   detection in a vaccine trial cohort of 2,204 tribal people residing in
   Sundargarh district, Odisha between 2006 and 2011. We compared measures
   of transmission at the village and individual level in 2006-2009 versus
   2010-2011 after ACT (in all villages) and LLINs (in three villages) were
   implemented.
   Results: During 2006-2009 malaria incidence per village ranged from
   156-512 per 1000 persons per year and slide prevalence ranged from
   28-53\%. Routine indoor residual spray did not prevent seasonal peaks of
   malaria. Post-intervention impact in 2010-2011 was dramatic with ranges
   of 14-71 per 1000 persons per year and 6-16\% respectively. When
   adjusted for village, ACT alone decreased the incidence of malaria by
   83\% (IRR 0.17, 95\%CI: 0.10, 0.27) and areas using ACT and LLINs
   decreased the incidence of malaria by 86\% (IRR 0.14, 95\% CI: 0.05,
   0.38). After intervention, the age of malaria cases, their parasite
   density, and proportion with fever at the time of screening increased.
   Conclusions: ACT, and LLINs along with ACT, effectively reduced malaria
   incidence in a closely monitored population living in a forest ecotype.
   It is unclear whether LLINs were impactful when prompt and quality
   antimalarial treatment was available. In spite of universal coverage,
   substantial malaria burden remained.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Development of resistance among mosquito vectors of diseases
   is of growing concern in many countries of the subtropics, including
   much of India. The distributions of susceptibility/resistance to
   insecticides are scarcely recorded and are unknown in many parts of
   India. This manuscript reports the susceptibility status among strains
   of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus
   collected from different geographical areas of Bruhat Bengaluru
   Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Karnataka, to six conventionally used
   insecticides. RESULTS: An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx.
   quinquefasciatus from different geographic areas showed susceptibility
   towards temephos. However, susceptibility was meagre for most of the
   other insecticides used in the study. Strong resistance to propoxur was
   reported in Ullala (RR90 = 467.1) and Bannerghatta (RR90 = 12 265)
   populations of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti respectively. RR90 = 12 830
   was recorded as higher in the Yelahanka (YLK) population of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus to neem. Significant differences at LC50 and LC90
   concentrations were observed against various insecticides in different
   mosquito populations. Resistance was observed against some of the
   larvicides for the diagnostic dose recommended by WHO. CONCLUSION: The
   results form baseline data on the susceptibility status of three
   medically important mosquito vectors of diseases to commonly used
   insecticides in the field at present emphasise the importance of
   carrying out more effective and planned vector control measures.

Abstract = {{Malaria is largely neglected in the South-East Asia Region (SEAR),
   although it has the highest number of people susceptible to the disease.
   Malaria in the SEAR exhibits special epidemiological characteristics
   such as ``forest malaria{''} and malaria due to migration across
   international borders. The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has been a
   focal-point for the emergence of drug resistant malaria. With the recent
   emergence of artemisinin resistance, coupled with the limited
   availability of insecticides, malaria control efforts in the SEAR face a
   steep challenge. Indirect man-made factors such as climate change, as
   well as direct man-made factors such as the circulation of counterfeit
   drugs have added to the problem. Increased monitoring, surveillance,
   pharmacovigilance as well as cross-border collaboration are required to
   address these problems. Regional networking and data-sharing will keep
   all stakeholders updated about the status of various malaria control
   programmes in the SEAR. Cutting-edge technologies such as GIS/GPS
   (geographical information system/global positioning system) systems and
   mobile phones can provide information in ``real-time{''}. A holistic and
   sustained approach to malaria control by integrated vector management
   (IVM) is suggested, in which all the stakeholder countries work
   collaboratively as a consortium. This approach will address the malaria
   problem in a collective manner so that malaria control can be sustained
   over time.}},

Title = {{Mosquito larval source management for controlling malaria}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Malaria is an important cause of illness and death in people living in
   many parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Long-lasting
   insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS)
   reduce malaria transmission by targeting the adult mosquito vector and
   are key components of malaria control programmes. However, mosquito
   numbers may also be reduced by larval source management (LSM), which
   targets mosquito larvae as they mature in aquatic habitats. This is
   conducted by permanently or temporarily reducing the availability of
   larval habitats (habitat modification and habitat manipulation), or by
   adding substances to standing water that either kill or inhibit the
   development of larvae (larviciding).
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effectiveness of mosquito LSM for preventing malaria.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register;
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE;
   EMBASE; CABS Abstracts; and LILACS up to 24 October 2012. We
   handsearched the Tropical Diseases Bulletin from 1900 to 2010, the
   archives of the World Health Organization (up to 11 February 2011), and
   the literature database of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (up to
   2 March 2011). We also contacted colleagues in the field for relevant
   articles.
   Selection criteria
   We included cluster randomized controlled trials (cluster-RCTs),
   controlled before-and-after trials with at least one year of baseline
   data, and randomized cross-over trials that compared LSM with no LSM for
   malaria control. We excluded trials that evaluated biological control of
   anopheline mosquitoes with larvivorous fish.
   Data collection and analysis
   At least two authors assessed each trial for eligibility. We extracted
   data and at least two authors independently determined the risk of bias
   in the included studies. We resolved all disagreements through
   discussion with a third author. We analyzed the data using Review
   Manager 5 software.
   Main results
   We included 13 studies; four cluster-RCTs, eight controlled
   before-and-after trials, and one randomized cross-over trial. The
   included studies evaluated habitat modification (one study), habitat
   modification with larviciding (two studies), habitat manipulation (one
   study), habitat manipulation plus larviciding (two studies), or
   larviciding alone (seven studies) in a wide variety of habitats and
   countries.
   Malaria incidence
   In two cluster-RCTs undertaken in Sri Lanka, larviciding of abandoned
   mines, streams, irrigation ditches, and rice paddies reduced malaria
   incidence by around three-quarters compared to the control (RR 0.26,
   95\% CI 0.22 to 0.31, 20,124 participants, two trials, moderate quality
   evidence). In three controlled before-and-after trials in urban and
   rural India and rural Kenya, results were inconsistent (98,233
   participants, three trials, very low quality evidence). In one trial in
   urban India, the removal of domestic water containers together with
   weekly larviciding of canals and stagnant pools reduced malaria
   incidence by three quarters. In one trial in rural India and one trial
   in rural Kenya, malaria incidence was higher at baseline in intervention
   areas than in controls. However dam construction in India, and
   larviciding of streams and swamps in Kenya, reduced malaria incidence to
   levels similar to the control areas. In one additional randomized
   cross-over trial in the flood plains of the Gambia River, where larval
   habitats were extensive and ill-defined, larviciding by ground teams did
   not result in a statistically significant reduction in malaria incidence
   (2039 participants, one trial).
   Parasite prevalence
   In one cluster-RCT from Sri Lanka, larviciding reduced parasite
   prevalence by almost 90\% (RR 0.11, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.22, 2963
   participants, one trial, moderate quality evidence). In five controlled
   before-and-after trials in Greece, India, the Philippines, and Tanzania,
   LSM resulted in an average reduction in parasite prevalence of around
   two-thirds (RR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.55, 8041 participants, five
   trials, moderate quality evidence). The interventions in these five
   trials included dam construction to reduce larval habitats, flushing of
   streams, removal of domestic water containers, and larviciding. In the
   randomized cross-over trial in the flood plains of the Gambia River,
   larviciding by ground teams did not significantly reduce parasite
   prevalence (2039 participants, one trial).
   Authors' conclusions
   In Africa and Asia, LSM is another policy option, alongside LLINs and
   IRS, for reducing malaria morbidity in both urban and rural areas where
   a sufficient proportion of larval habitats can be targeted. Further
   research is needed to evaluate whether LSM is appropriate or feasible in
   parts of rural Africa where larval habitats are more extensive.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles fluviatilis James, an important malaria vector in the Oriental
   region has been established as a complex of at least three cryptic
   species which vary in their biological characteristics and malaria
   transmission potential. The sibling species S, T and U of Fluviatilis
   Complex can be identified by examination of species-specific fixed
   inversions in the polytene chromosomes and can also be differentiated by
   an allele-specific PCR assay based on differences in the D3 region of
   28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of these species. Here we report a new An.
   fluviatilis population from villages under Laksar Community Health
   Centre, District Haridwar (Uttarakhand state), India which differs from
   the three sibling species of Fluviatilis Complex by two fixed
   paracentric inversions, s(1) and S in polytene chromosome arms 2 and 3
   respectively. Longitudinal study carried out in study villages showed
   that the new cytotype was sympatric with species T and U in all the
   collections and no inversion heterozygotes were observed between them.
   Thus presence of two fixed paracentric inversions in polytene
   chromosomes with total absence of inversion heterozygotes demonstrates
   reproductive isolation which unequivocally establishes this cytological
   variant as a new species, provisionally designated as species V in the
   Fluviatilis Complex. Analysis of DNA sequences of 133 domain of 28S rDNA
   and ITS 2 region has also shown that species V is distinctly different
   from species S, T and U. With the discovery of new species in the
   Fluviatilis Complex, in-depth studies are required to know its
   distribution pattern and biological characteristics and to ascertain its
   role in malaria transmission. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess the larvicidal property of
   marine actinobacterial compound 5-(2,4-dimethylbenzyl) pyrrolidin-2-one
   (DMBPO) extracted and isolated from Streptomyces VITSVK5 sp. tested
   against the larvae of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus Canestrini
   (Acari: Ixodidae), Anopheles stephensi Liston, and Culex
   tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae). The isolate bacteria was
   taxonomically characterized, identified, and designated as Streptomyces
   VITSVK5 sp. The crude extract was loaded on silica gel column and eluted
   with chloroform: methanol. The isolated pure compound was analyzed by
   thin layer chromatography using chloroform and methanol as the solvent
   system and confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The
   structure of the purified compound was established from infrared,
   ultraviolet, H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), C-13-NMR, and mass
   spectral data. The chemical shift assignments obtained for the aliphatic
   compound from H-1-NMR corresponding to the molecular formula C13H17NO.
   Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of compound which was
   identified as DMBPO. In the present study, Streptomyces VITSVK5 sp.
   crude extract and different fractions were tested against the larvae of
   parasites at the concentration of 1,000 ppm. Those fractions showing
   100\% mortality in 24 h alone was selected for further column
   chromatographic separation. The purified compound, C13H17NO, was tested
   in the concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 ppm and observed
   the percent larval mortality of 100, 70, 64, 40, and 28 against R.
   microplus; 100, 79, 63, 36, and 22 against A. stephensi; and 100, 84,
   67, 42, and 27 against C. tritaeniorhynchus, respectively. The crude
   extract showed parasitic effects after 24 h of exposure at 1,000 ppm,
   and parasite mortality was observed against the larvae of R. microplus
   (LC50=210.39 ppm, r(2)=0.873); A. stephensi (LC50=169.38 ppm,
   r(2)=0.840); and C. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50=198.75 ppm, r(2)=0.887). The
   maximum efficacy was observed in purified marine actinobacterial
   compound DMBPO with LC50 and r(2) values against the larvae of R.
   microplus (84.31 ppm, 0.889); A. stephensi (88.97 ppm, 0.817), and C.
   tritaeniorhynchus (74.95 ppm, 0.781), respectively. The control
   (distilled water) showed nil mortality in the concurrent assay.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude of regional malaria risk is dependent primarily on the
   dynamics and distribution of the vector species, which are determined
   mainly by climate conditions. A coupled model with ecophysiological and
   climatological factors was developed to estimate the spatiotemporal
   distribution of the five species of dominant malaria vectors in monsoon
   Asia. Here, we examined how the potential distribution obtained from the
   model could explain trends in malaria incidence observed in India, which
   has the highest number of confirmed cases of malaria in Asia. Most
   notably, there was a significant positive correlation between annual
   malaria incidences and the maximum generation number of vectors for each
   state (p < 0.001). Malaria incidence tended to increase exponentially as
   vector generation number increased. In addition, the interannual
   variation in observed regional malaria incidences was synchronized with
   that of the potential number of vector generations. The observed
   seasonal peak of malaria incidences corresponded closely to the
   simulated appearance period of vector species, except for intensively
   irrigated areas that experience anthropogenic impacts on hydrologic
   conditions. Simulated vector distributions effectively expressed spatial
   and temporal prevalence of malaria in India. This novel approach to
   modeling based on vector ecology is an effective method for assessing
   malaria risk.}},

   Methods: Adult mosquitoes were collected and the abdomen of the blood
   fed females were crushed on a filter paper for blood meal analysis and
   subjected to precipitin test.
   Results: The blood meal analysis showed that Anopheles subpictus had a
   preference towards cattle blood, An. culicifacies and An. stephensi
   preferred human blood, while, An. annularis was noted to feed only on
   bovine blood.
   Conclusion: Although An. annularis, has been recently reported from the

   suggest that this species is a vector of malaria and therefore
   preventive measures should be taken well in advance before this species
   gets established in the area.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative relations between weather variables and malaria
   vector can enable pro-active control through meteorological monitoring.
   Such relations are also critical for reliable projections in a changing
   climate, especially since the vector abundance depends on a combination
   of weather variables, each in a given range. Further, such models need
   to be region-specific as vector population and exposure depend on
   regional characteristics.
   Methods: We consider days of genesis based on daily temperature,
   rainfall and humidity in given ranges. We define a single model
   parameter based on estimates of exposure and transmission to calibrate
   the model; the model is applied to 12 districts of Arunachal Pradesh, a
   region endemic to malaria. The epidemiological data is taken as blood
   samples that test positive. The meteorological data is adopted from NCEP
   daily Reanalysis on a global grid; population data is used to estimate
   exposure and transmission coefficients.
   Results: The observed annual cycles (2006-2010) and the interannual
   variability (2002-2010) of epidemiology are well simulated for each of
   the 12 districts by the model. While no single weather variable like
   temperature can reproduce the observed epidemiology, a combination of
   temperature, rainfall and humidity provides an accurate description of
   the annual cycle as well as the inter annual variability over all the 12
   districts.
   Conclusion: Inclusion of the three meteorological variables, along with
   the expressions for exposure and transmission, can quite accurately
   represent observed epidemiology over multiple locations and different
   years. The model is potentially useful for outbreak forecasts at short
   time scales through high resolution weather monitoring; however,
   validation with longer and independent epidemiological data is required
   for more robust estimation of realizable skill. While the model has been
   examined over a specific region, the basic algorithm is easily
   applicable to other regions; the model can account for shifting
   vulnerability due to regional climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes have developed resistance to various synthetic insecticides,
   making its control increasingly difficult. Insecticides of botanical
   origin may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the
   future. The adulticidal and repellent activities of crude hexane,
   chloroform, benzene, acetone, and methanol extracts of the leaf of
   Cassia tora were assayed for their toxicity against three important
   vector mosquitoes, viz., Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and
   Anopheles stephensi. The adult mortality was observed after 24 h of
   exposure. All extracts showed moderate adulticidal effects; however, the
   highest adult mortality observed was found in methanol extract. The LC50
   and LC90 values of C. tora leaf extracts against adulticidal activity of
   (hexane, chloroform benzene, acetone, and methanol) C. quinquefasciatus,
   A. aegypti, and A. stephensi were the following: C. quinquefasciatus
   LC50 values were 338.81, 315.73, 296.13, 279.23, and 261.03 ppm and LC90
   values were 575.77, 539.31, 513.99, 497.06, and 476.03 ppm; A. aegypti
   LC50 values were 329.82, 307.31, 287.15, 269.57, and 252.03 ppm and LC90
   values were 563.24, 528.33, 496.92, 477.61, and 448.05 ppm; and A.
   stephensi LC50 values were 317.28, 300.30, 277.51, 263.35, and 251.43
   ppm and LC90 values were 538.22, 512.90, 483.78, 461.08, and 430.70 ppm,
   respectively. The results of the repellent activity of hexane,
   chloroform, benzene, acetone, and methanol extracts of C. tora plant at
   three different concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/cm(2) were
   applied on skin of forearm in man and exposed against adult female
   mosquitoes. In this observation, this plant crude extracts gave
   protection against mosquito bites without any allergic reaction to the
   test person, and also, the repellent activity is dependent on the
   strength of the plant extracts. These results suggest that the leaf
   solvent plant extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal
   eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquitoes. This is the first
   report on mosquito adulticidal and repellent activities of the reported
   C. tora against mosquito vectors from Southern India.}},

Abstract = {{Morinda citrifolia leaf extract was tested for larvicidal activity
   against three medically important mosquito vectors such as malarial
   vector Anopheles stephensi, dengue vector Aedes aegypti, and filarial
   vector Culex quinquefasciatus. The plant material was shade dried at
   room temperature and powdered coarsely. From the leaf, 1-kg powder was
   macerated with 3.0 L of hexane, chloroform, acetone, methanol, and water
   sequentially for a period of 72 h each and filtered. The yield of
   extracts was hexane (13.56 g), chloroform (15.21 g), acetone (12.85 g),
   methanol (14.76 g), and water (12.92 g), respectively. The extracts were
   concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary vacuum evaporator and
   stored at a temperature of 4A degrees C. The M. citrifolia leaf extract
   at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ppm caused a significant mortality of
   three mosquito species. Hexane, chloroform, acetone, and water caused
   moderate considerable mortality; however, the highest larval mortality
   was methanolic extract, observed in three mosquito vectors. The larval
   mortality was observed after 24-h exposure. No mortality was observed in

   626.58, 571.89, 505.06, and 549.51 ppm, respectively. The Aedes aegypti
   had values of LC50 = 361.75, 343.22, 315.40, 277.92, and 306.98 ppm and
   LC90 = 687.39, 659.02, 611.35, 568.18, and 613.25 ppm, respectively. The
   Culex quinquefasciatus had values of LC50 = 382.96, 369.85, 344.34,
   330.42, and 324.64 ppm and LC90 = 726.18, 706.57, 669.28, 619.63, and
   644.47 ppm, respectively. The results of the leaf extract of M.
   citrifolia are promising as good larvicidal activity against the
   mosquito vector Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex
   quinquefasciatus. This is a new eco-friendly approach for the control of
   vector control programs. Therefore, this study provides first report on
   the larvicidal activities against three species of mosquito vectors of
   this plant extracts from India.}},

Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles (Cellia) maculatus is considered a group of at least nine
   formally named species. Faced with the difficulty of correct
   morphological identification due to overlapping characters, several
   member species of the An. maculatus group are known to play important
   role in malaria transmission in the Oriental region. Current assemblage,
   distribution and vectorial importance of the member species within the
   Maculatus group is far from clear in the north-eastern region of India.
   Our study encompassing 410 individuals, collected from 67 geo-referenced
   spots across the eight north-east Indian states, identified the presence
   of 6 member species of the Maculatus group using the molecular tools.
   Anopheles dravidicus and Anopheles rampae were documented for the first
   time in this part of India with latter forming the new country record.
   While Anopheles pseudowillmori (59.5\%) and An. maculatus (32\%) were
   widely available species in most of the north-eastern states, restricted
   distribution of Anopheles willmori to Nagaland and that of Anopheles
   sawadwongpomi and An. rampae to Mizoram state was noted. None of the
   species was found positive for human malaria parasite. While no
   intraspecific differences existed in the sequences of second internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of ribosomal DNA (r-DNA) of the member
   species of the Maculatus group within north-east India, few differences
   were detected in the sequences of An. dravidicus, An. maculatus and An.
   pseudowillmori from north-east India with species from the neighbouring
   countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and incrimination of Anopheles fluviatilis species S
   (Diptera: Culicidae) in a malaria endemic forest area of Chhattisgarh
   state, central India}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chhattisgarh state in central India is highly endemic for
   malaria and contributes about 13\% of annually reported malaria cases in
   the country with predominance of P. falciparum. Entomological
   investigations were carried out in a tribal forested area of district
   Bastar located in the southern part of Chhattisgarh state to record the
   prevalence of sibling species of Anopheles fluviatilis and An.
   culicifacies complexes. The vector species complexes were investigated
   at sibling species level for their biology in terms of resting and
   feeding behavior and malaria transmission potential.
   Methods: Indoor resting vector mosquitoes collected during 2010-2011
   were identified to sibling species by cytotaxonomy and polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay. The blood meal source analysis and incrimination
   studies were done at sibling species level by counter current
   immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   respectively.
   Results: Analysis of sibling species composition revealed predominance
   of An. fluviatilis species S in the study area, which was found to be
   highly anthropophagic and rested in human dwellings whereas the
   sympatric species T was primarily zoophagic. Incrimination studies
   showed high sporozoite rate in species S, thereby confirming its
   vectorial efficiency. An. culicifacies was encountered in low numbers
   and comprised species B and C in almost equal proportion. Both these
   species were found to be exclusively zoophagic.
   Conclusion: The observations made strongly suggest that species S of
   Fluviatilis Complex is the principal vector of malaria in certain forest
   areas of district Bastar, Chhattisgarh state and should be the target
   species for vector control operation. Vector control strategies based on
   biological characteristics of Fluviatilis S will lead to substantial
   decline in malaria incidence in such areas.}},

Abstract = {{A cross sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of
   synthetic pyrethroids (SP) resistance in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)
   microplus in India. Twenty-seven areas located in six agro-climatic
   regions were selected for the collection of engorged ticks using two
   stage stratified sampling procedure.
   Adult immersion test (AIT) and larval packet test (LPT) were optimized
   using laboratory reared susceptible line of R.(B.) microplus (IVRI-I)
   for determination of 95\% lethal concentration (LC95) of deltamethrin
   (29.6 ppm in AIT and 35.5 ppm in LPT) and cypermethrin (349.1 ppm in AIT
   and 350.7 ppm in LPT). The AIT with a discriminating dose (2x LC95) was
   used to detect deltamethrin and cypermethrin resistance in the field
   isolates of R.(B.) micro plus.
   On the basis of the data generated on three variables viz., mortality,
   egg masses and reproductive index, the resistance level was categorized
   as I, II, III and IV. The overall prevalence of SP-resistant R.( B.)
   microplus among the sampled farms was 66.6\% (18/27). Out of these 18
   areas, resistance to deltamethrin at level I was detected in 08 areas
   (resistance factor = 2.0-4.9), at level II in 09 areas (RF = 5.2-11.8),
   at level III in 01 area (RF = 34.9) and at level IV in 01 area (RF =
   95.7). The resistance to cypermethrin was detected in 16 areas and level
   of resistance was detected at level I in 10 areas (RF = 2.06-4.64) and
   at level II in 06 areas (RF = 5.13-9.88). The middle-gangetic and
   trans-gangetic plains revealed higher density of resistant ticks where
   intensive cross bred cattle population are reared and the SP compounds
   are commonly used. The data generated on acaricide resistant status in
   ticks will help in formulating tick control strategy for the country.

   amenability to control malaria through indoor residual spray}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{175-180}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: In the present study, an attempt was made to
   find reasons of ineffectiveness of indoor residual spray to interrupt
   malaria transmission by investigating the behaviour of two variants of
   Anopheles stepnesi, viz, type form and mysorensis in rural areas of
   Rajasthan, India.
   Methods: Both low malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to 1976) and high
   malarious (DDT spray from 1958 to April 2006) villages were selected for
   the study in Arid zone district Jodhpur, Rajasthan during March-April
   2006. Resting behaviour of the species during all its movement rhythms
   covering 24 h period related to: (i) swarming/mating; (ii) pre- and
   post-biting rest; (iii) after feed resting between hoping movements;
   (iv) night and day time resting and; (v) diel activity movements in
   response to temperature changes, were carried out.
   Results: The results showed that household objects like cupboards,
   furnitures, hanging clothes, goods stacked on loft, stored clothes,
   cobwebs and floor were the dominant resting sites both in sprayed and
   unsprayed villages. About 95 and 97\% of An. stephensi preferred to rest
   on household objects of unsprayed and sprayed villages respectively.
   There was no significant difference in resting behaviour of the species
   in both groups of villages (p >0.05). The pre-biting resting time was
   recorded as 5 to 15 min whereas post-biting resting time lasted for 15
   to 25 min. After biting outdoor (in courtyard open to sky) species
   starts entering the rooms at around 2330 hrs. It was observed that
   during III quarter (0100 to 0400 hrs) maximum species entered into the
   room were 56\% in unsprayed and 62\% in sprayed villages. Statistically
   there was no significant difference in the entry of mosquitoes (p >0.05)
   in both the groups of villages.
   Conclusion: Before DDT era, An. stephensi was found resting at all
   heights of the walls inside the human dwellings. Present study revealed
   that An. stephensi is trying to avoid sprayable surfaces and tend to
   rest on unsprayable surfaces during all its movement rhythms starting
   from swarming, pre-/post-biting and during hopping movements in the
   courtyard and thereafter household objects inside the room as final day
   time resting. It was concluded that changed behaviour of resting of An.
   stephensi on unsprayable objects in sprayed rooms largely accounted for
   failure of malaria control. Control of An. stephensi, thus requires an
   integrated vector control strategy based upon interesectoral,
   environmental, larviciding with chemical/biolarvicide and use of
   larvivorous fish wherever feasible. Such a control strategy offers
   cost-effective and sustainable option than indoor residual spray.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: In the present study, Icon (R) Life net, a
   long-lasting polyethylene net, 100 denier and bursting strength of
   minimum 280 kpa incorporated with deltamethrin @ 65 mg/m(2) was
   evaluated for its efficacy in reducing the density of malaria vector
   Anopheles culicifacies and impact on malaria prevalence in a malaria
   endemic area of District Gautam Budh Nagar, India.
   Methods: Wash resistance of Icon (R) Life LLIN was determined up to 20
   serial washings using An. culicifacies in cone bioassays under field
   conditions. Efficacy of Icon (R) Life LLIN was determined in the field
   in three sets of villages in District Gautam Budh Nagar (Uttar Pradesh),
   India, selected randomly for the intervention with Icon (R) Life LLIN,
   untreated nets and a control without any intervention for the period of
   August 2008-July 2009. Entomological and malariometric indices in all
   the three villages were compared during pre- and post-intervention
   periods for one year against An. culicifacies. A survey was also
   conducted in the village provided with Icon (R) Life LLIN to assessing
   the perception of community regarding acceptance of these nets by the
   community. Results: In cone bioassays on Icon (R) Life LLIN with An.
   culicifacies, >= 95\% knockdown within 1 h and 100\% mortality after 24
   h exposure were reported even after 20x serial washings under field
   conditions.
   Results of the field study revealed reduced entry rate, resting density
   and parity rate of An. culicifacies in the village with Icon (R) Life
   LLIN when compared to no net and untreated net villages. Number of
   malaria cases reported were less in the Icon (R) Life LLIN used villages
   when compared to other two villages. The community compliance and
   acceptance was high and no adverse health events were reported by the
   households using these nets.
   Conclusions: Icon (R) Life LLIN is an effective intervention for the
   control of An. culicifacies transmitted malaria in India. Long-term
   studies are indicated for the duration of effectiveness and to ascertain
   the epidemiological impact of the use of Icon (R) Life nets.}},

Abstract = {{An important variable in determining the vectorial capacity of malaria
   mosquito species is the degree of mosquito-human contact. This parameter
   can be affected by community sleeping behavior and the host-feeding
   habits of vectors. A cross-sectional study of 775 randomly selected
   inhabitants, including 385 Baluchi residents and 390 Afghani refugees,
   was conducted in a malarious area in Sabaz District, Sistan-Baluchestan
   Province, southeastern Iran. In addition, monitoring of human landing
   periodicity of main malaria vectors was carried out during an entire
   transmission season. Afghanis and Baluchis showed diversity in sleeping
   behavior. Most (79.6\%) respondents were familiar with symptoms of
   malaria and also aware of an association between mosquitoes and malaria.
   Despite this familiarity, 94.6\% of Afghan refugees, 74.8\% of Baluch
   residents, and 87.2\% of study participants did not use self-protection
   preventive measures. Overall, only 8.8\% of participants reported using
   bed nets regularly. Surveyed persons used bed nets mainly during second
   quarter of night. Three major species of malaria vectors (Anopheles
   culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, and An. stephensi) started biting by
   sunset and continued throughout the night. The results of present study
   indicated that synchronization of encounters between inhabitants and
   mosquito vectors was caused by poor self-protection and sleeping
   behavior of inhabitants. In addition, diversity in culture and behavior
   of the two communities may cause the prevalence of malaria to be
   different between them. Therefore, promoting awareness of
   self-protection against mosquito bites could promote community
   participation in malaria elimination program in this malaria-endemic
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-based insecticides for vector control are urgently needed for
   Anopheles barbirostris, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes albopictus
   which are the primary vectors of malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and
   dengue, respectively, in India and other South East Asian countries. In
   the present study, larvicidal, adulticidal, and repellent activities of
   acetone root bark extract of Hiptage benghalensis were tested against
   the larvae and adults of the three mosquito vectors. The acetone root
   bark extracts of H. benghalensis was more effective as larvicides with
   low LC50 (11.15-16.78 ppm) and LT50 (1.25-4.84 h at 200 and 400 ppm)
   values. Results of log probit analysis (at 95 \% confidence level) and
   regression analysis of crude acetone root bark extract of H.
   benghalensis revealed that lethal concentration (LC50) values gradually
   decreased with the exposure periods; lethal time (LT50) decreased with
   the concentration, and the mortality is positively correlated with the
   concentration. The order of susceptibility of the three mosquito species
   was as follows: A. albopictus > A. barbirostris > C. quinquefascitus.
   Biochemical changes were also evidenced in third instar larvae of three
   mosquito species following a sublethal exposure for 24 h. The level of
   sugar, glycogen, lipids, and proteins was significantly (P < 0.05)
   reduced in larvae treated with H. benghalensis. The acetone root bark
   extracts of H. benghalensis is less toxic to adults and repelled
   laboratory-reared female A. barbirostris, A. albopictus, and C.
   quinquefascitus with the short median protection times of 57.66-135,
   72.41-134.16, and 47.66-93 min, respectively. The present investigation
   proves it as a potent larvicide against A. albopictus, A. barbirostris,
   and C. quinquefascitus, which can be recommended to control these
   mosquito species on its breeding site. However, further investigations
   are needed to confirm the lethal effects of H. benghalensis in field
   conditions and its impact on the nontarget organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) have been advocated as an
   effective tool for prevention and control of malaria. Olyset net was the
   first LLINs which became commercially available and obtained WHO
   approval. According to the national strategic plan on evaluation of
   Olyset net, a field trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of
   these nets against malaria vectors in an endemic area in the southeast
   of Iran.
   Fourteen villages with similar topographical and epidemiological
   situations were selected and randomly assigned to two clusters of the
   study: Olyset net and untreated net. Distribution of nets was carried
   out to cover 100\% of the population in Olyset net and untreated net
   cluster.
   Anopheline mosquitoes were collected monthly using different WHO
   standard methods in both areas to determine their abundance, feeding
   pattern and resting behaviour. Human blood index was determined using
   ELISA test. Additionally, Olyset nets were evaluated for their
   biological activity using WHO cone bioassay test by susceptible colony
   of Anopheles stephensi (Beech strain) and then for insecticide residues
   by employing high performance thin layer chromatography. Malaria
   incidence was measured by passive and active case detection from all
   study population.
   In total 2115 adult anopheline mosquitoes were collected and identified
   using morphological characters. They comprised of seven species:
   Anopheles dthali (Liston), A. culicifacies (Giles). A. stephensi
   (Liston). A. superpictus (Grassi), A.fluviatilis (James), A. moghulensis
   (Christophers) and A. turkhudi (Liston). A. dthali, A. culicifacies and
   A. stephensi were most prevalent species in both areas.
   In the Olyset net study area, there was a significant reduction of
   41.1\%, 54.4\%, 59.39\% and 64.1\% in the indoor-resting density of A.
   culicifacies, A. stephensi, A. dthali and A. superpictus, respectively,
   with an overall reduction of 39.3\% in total mosquitoes in comparison
   with untreated net area. A significant reduction was also observed in
   human blood index of vector species in the Olyset net villages.
   Bioefficacy test results of Olyset nets showed that the median knockdown
   time was 1.48 and 3.25 min, while the average mortality rate was 100\%
   and 72.3\%+/- 7.07 in baseline and after 1 year of intervention,
   respectively. The average permethrin content reached to 68.31\% (683.1
   mg/m(2)) of the initial insecticide dose of 937 +/- 21.69 mg/m(2)
   (nearly 1000 mg/m(2)) at the end of intervention.
   Malaria incidence was reduced by 96.6\% and 64.8\% in the village with
   Olyset nets and in the villages with untreated nets, respectively.
   During intervention period, there was a reduction of 93.2\% in malaria
   incidence in Olyset net area as compared to the untreated area.
   This study indicated that Olyset nets have a major impact on malaria
   vectors and disease burden; therefore it could be recommended as an
   effective personal protection tool for malaria control in malarious
   areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out on Solanum xanthocarpum fruit extract
   and copepods Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides, which were assessed for the
   control of dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, under laboratory conditions.
   The medicinal plants were collected from the outskirts of Bharathiar
   University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The shade-dried fruit
   materials were extracted by employing the Soxhlet apparatus with
   methanol (organic solvent) 8 h and the extracts were filtered through a
   Buchner funnel with Whatman number 1 filter paper. The fruit extracts
   were concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary vacuum evaporator
   and stored at a temperature of 4A degrees C. S. xanthocarpum fruit
   extract (SXFE) at 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ppm caused significant
   mortality of Ae. aegypti. The LC50 and LC90 of S. xanthocarpum against
   the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae were 170.91, 195.07, 221.45,
   253.18, and 279.52 ppm and 320.62, 366.48, 410.20, 435.16, and 462.10
   ppm, respectively. A study was conducted to test whether the predatory
   efficiency of copepods on first instars changed in the presence of SXFE.
   The percentage of predatory efficiency of copepod was 6.5 \% in
   treatments without SFXE and the percentage of predatory efficiency
   increased up to 8.7 \% when copepods were combined with SFXE. This
   increase in predation efficiency may be caused by detrimental effects of
   the SFXE active principle compound (solanocarpine and solanocarpidine)
   on the mosquito larvae. Repeated application of fruit extract of S.
   xanthocarpum does not cause changes in copepod populations because fruit
   extract is highly degradable in the environment. Therefore, the present
   investigation clearly exhibits that the fruit extract of S. xanthocarpum
   and copepod M. thermocyclopoides could serve as a potential of highest
   mortality rate against the mosquito larvae under laboratory conditions.
   This is a new eco-friendly approach for the control of Ae. aegypti
   mosquito as target species. Therefore, this study provides the first
   report on the combined effect of mosquitocidal activity of this fruit
   extract and copepods of M. thermocyclopoides against dengue vector Ae.
   aegypti from India.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum with resistance to
   chloroquine (CQ), the safest and cheapest anti-malarial drug, coupled
   with the increasing cost of alternative drugs especially in developing
   countries have necessitated the urgent need to tap the potential of
   plants for novel anti-malarials. The present study investigates the
   anti-malarial activity of the methanolic extracts of 13 medicinal plants
   from the Malaiyur and Javadhu hills of South India against blood stage
   CQ-sensitive (3D7) and CQ-resistant (INDO) strains of P. falciparum in
   culture using the fluorescence-based SYBR Green I assay.
   Sorbitol-synchronized parasites were incubated under normal culture
   conditions at 2\% hematocrit and 1\% parasitemia in the absence or
   presence of increasing concentrations of plant extracts. CQ and
   artemisinin were used as positive controls, while 0.4\% DMSO was used as
   the negative control. The cytotoxic effects of extracts on host cells
   were assessed by functional assay using HeLa cells cultured in RPMI
   containing 10\% fetal bovine serum, 0.21\% sodium bicarbonate and 50 mu
   g/mL gentamycin (complete medium). Plant extracts (bark methanol
   extracts of Annona squamosa (IC50, 30 mu g/mL), leaf extracts of Ocimum
   gratissimum (IC50, 32 mu g/mL), Ocimum tenuiflorum (IC50, 31 mu g/mL),
   Solanum torvum (IC50, 31 mu g/mL) and Justicia procumbens (IC50, 63 mu
   g/mL), showed moderate activity. The leaf extracts of Aristolochia
   indica (IC50, 10 mu g/mL), Cassia auriculata (IC50, 14 mu g/mL),
   Chrysanthemum indicum (IC50, 20 mu g/mL) and Dolichos biflorus (IC50, 20
   mu g/mL) showed promising activity and low activity was observed in the
   flower methanol extracts of A. indica , leaf methanol extract of
   Catharanthus roseus, and Gymnema sylvestre (IC50, > 100 mu g/mL). These
   four extracts exhibited promising IC50 (mu g/mL) of 17, 24, 19 and 24
   respectively also against the CQ resistant INDO strain of P. falciparum.
   The high TC50 in mammalian cell cytotoxicity assay and the low IC50 in
   anti-malarial P. falciparum assay indicates selectivity and good
   resistance indices in the range of 0.9-1.7 for leaf extracts of A.
   indica, C. auriculata, C. indicum and D. biflorus suggests that these
   may serve as anti-malarial agents even in their crude form. These
   results indicate a possible explanation of the traditional use of some
   of these medicinal plants against malaria or malaria-like conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria parasite requires a specific time to replicate and disseminate
   in the mosquito's body before transmission to naive hosts can occur.
   Vector control has a proven record in the prevention and control of
   malaria. The evaluation of vector control strategies requires accurate
   methods of predicting mosquito age. Anopheles stephensi is the principal
   malaria vector of the desert part of India. The objective of this study
   was to correlate the age of laboratory reared and field collected adults
   of An. stephensi with the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
   activity. The measurement of g6pd activity was carried out in a UV-vis
   spectrophotometer. The g6pd activity in the males and females An.
   stephensi was inversely proportional to their age. A significant
   correlation of the g6pd activity was recorded between the field
   collected and laboratory reared mosquitoes. The g6pd activity in the
   males An. stephensi was found to be significantly higher than the
   females. The finding of the present study is useful for the prediction
   of the age of males and females An. stephensi. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Diversity of anopheline species and their Plasmodium infection status in
   rural Bandarban, Bangladesh}},

Abstract = {{Background: Historically, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh
   was considered hyperendemic for malaria. To better understand the
   contemporary malaria epidemiology and to develop new and innovative
   control strategies, comprehensive epidemiologic studies are ongoing in
   two endemic unions of Bandarban district of CHT. Within these studies
   entomological surveillance has been undertaken to study the role of the
   existing anopheline species involved in the malaria transmission cycle
   throughout the year.
   Methods: CDC miniature light traps were deployed to collect anopheline
   mosquitoes from the sleeping room of the selected houses each month in a
   single union (Kuhalong). Molecular identification was carried out for
   available Anopheles species complexes. Circumsporozoite proteins (CSP)
   for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210 (Pv-210) and Plasmodium
   vivax-247(Pv-247) were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) from the female anopheline mosquitoes. To confirm CSP-ELISA
   results, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed.
   Results: A total of 2,837 anopheline mosquitoes, of which 2,576 were
   female, belonging to 20 species were collected from July 2009-June 2010.
   Anopheles jeyporiensis was the most abundant species (18.9\%), followed
   by An. vagus (16.8\%) and An. kochi (14.4\%). ELISA was performed on
   2,467 female mosquitoes of 19 species. 15 (0.6\%) female anophelines
   belonging to eight species were found to be positive for Plasmodium
   infection by CSP-ELISA. Of those, 11 (0.4\%) mosquitoes were positive
   for P. falciparum and four (0.2\%) for Pv-210. No mosquito was found
   positive for Pv-247. An. maculatus (2.1\%, 2/97) had the highest
   infection rate followed by An. umbrosus (1.7\%, 2/115) and An.
   barbirostris (1.1\%, 2/186). Other infected species were An. nigerrimus,
   An. nivipes, An. jeyporiensis, An. kochi, and An. vagus. Out of 11 P.
   falciparum CSP positive samples, seven turned out to be positive by PCR.
   None of the samples positive for Pv-210 was positive by PCR. In terms of
   abundance and incrimination, the results suggest that An. maculatus, An.
   jeyporiensis and An. nivipes play important roles in malaria
   transmission in Kuhalong.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that even in the presence
   of an insecticide impregnated bed-net intervention, a number of
   Anopheles species still play a role in the transmission of malaria.
   Further investigations are required to reveal the detailed biology and
   insecticide resistance patterns of the vector mosquito species in
   endemic areas in Bangladesh in order to assist with the planning and
   implementation of improved malaria control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to determine the human host preference and
   presence of Plasmodium parasite in field collected Anopheles mosquitoes
   among four villages around a military cantonment located in malaria
   endemic Sonitpur district of Assam, India. Encountered malaria vector
   mosquitoes were identified and tested for host preference and Plasmodium
   presence using PCR method. Human host preference was detected using
   simple PCR, whereas vectorial status for Plasmodium parasite was
   confirmed using first round PCR with genus specific primers and
   thereafter nested PCR with three Plasmodium species specific primers.
   Out of 1874 blood fed vector mosquitoes collected, 187 (10\%) were
   processed for PCR, which revealed that 40.6\% had fed on human blood;
   9.2\% of human blood fed mosquito were harbouring Plasmodium parasites,
   71.4\% of which were confirmed to Plasmodium falciparum. In addition to
   An. minimus, An. annularis and An. culicifacies were also found positive
   for malaria parasites. The present study exhibits the human feeding
   tendency of Anopheles vectors highlighting their malaria parasite
   transmission potential. The present study may serve as a model for
   understanding the human host preference of malaria vectors and detection
   of malaria parasite inside the anopheline vector mosquitoes in order to
   update their vectorial status for estimating the possible role of these
   mosquitoes in malaria transmission. The study has used PCR method and
   suggests that PCR-based method should be used in this entire malarious
   region to correctly report the vectorial position of different malaria

Title = {{Effectiveness and durability of Interceptor (R) long-lasting
   insecticidal nets in a malaria endemic area of central India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the present study, Interceptor (R), long-lasting
   polyester net, 75 denier and bursting strength of minimum 250 kPa coated
   with alpha-cypermethrin @ 200 mg/m(2) was evaluated for its efficacy in
   reducing the mosquito density, blood feeding inhibition and malaria
   incidence in a tribal dominated malaria endemic area in Chhattisgarh
   state, central India. Its durability, washing practices and usage
   pattern by the community was also assessed up to a period of three
   years.
   Methods: The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase
   (September 2006 to August 2007), 16 malaria endemic villages in district
   Kanker were randomized into three groups, viz. Interceptor net (LN),
   untreated polyester net (100 denier) and without net. Malaria cases were
   detected by undertaking fortnightly surveillance by home visits and
   treated as per the national drug policy. Mosquito collections were made
   by hand catch and pyrethrum space spray methods from human dwellings
   once every month. Slide positivity rate (SPR) and malaria incidence per
   1000 population (PI) were compared between the three study arms to
   assess the impact of use of Interceptor nets. Simultaneously, wash
   resistance studies were carried out in the laboratory by doing cone
   bioassays on Interceptor LNs washed up to 20 times. Activities
   undertaken in second Phase (April 2008 to October 2009) after an
   interval of about 18 months post-net distribution included questionnaire
   based surveys at every six months, i.e. 18, 24, 30 and 36 months to
   observe durability, usage pattern of LNs and washing practices by the
   community. After 36 months of field use, 30 nets were retrieved and
   sampled destructively for chemical analysis.
   Results: Interceptor nets were found effective in reducing the density,
   parity rate and blood feeding success rate of main malaria vector
   Anopheles culicifacies as compared to that in untreated net and no net
   villages. SPR in LN villages was 3.7\% as compared to 6.5\% in untreated
   and 11\% in no net villages. PI in LN villages was 16.4 in comparison to
   24.8 and 44.2 in untreated polyester net and no net villages
   respectively. In surveys carried out after three years of initial
   distribution, 78.7\% (737/936) nets were still in possession with the
   households, of which 68\% were used every night. An. culicifacies
   mortality was >80\% in cone bioassays done on LNs washed up to 20 times
   in laboratory. Mean alpha-cypermethrin content was 43.5 +/- 31.7 mg/m(2)
   on Interceptor LNs withdrawn after three years of household use against
   the baseline specification of 200 mg/m(2). A gradual increase in the
   proportion of holed nets was observed with the increased period of
   usage.
   Conclusion: Interceptor nets were highly effective in reducing vector
   densities as well as malaria incidence in the study villages.
   Availability of 78\% nets with the households in usable condition
   clearly indicated durability of Interceptor LNs up to three years in the
   rural setting of India. The nets were found to contain an effective
   concentration of alpha-cypermethrin against malaria vector after three
   years of household use.}},

   III, and IV Instar, and pupa were 2.73, 2.43, 3.03, 3.21, and 3.23
   mg/ml, respectively. Among the larval instars, instar II was the most
   susceptible. A considerable repellency was noted; a 10 mg/l
   concentration of S. wightii showed a repellency of 89\%. Sea weed
   extract and B. thuringiensis toxins affected the larval duration and
   adult emergence. A synergistic factor was also found for the effect of
   seaweed extract against larvae and pupae of mosquito. The synergistic
   factor showed at I Instar was 1.74, II Instar was 1.93, III Instar was
   1.37, IV Instar was 1.27, and pupa was 1.24, respectively. The result
   revealed that the seaweed extract of S. wightii in combination with
   microbial toxins has interfered in the gut system and resulted in
   mortality as well as growth inhibitory effects on mosquitoes.}},

Abstract = {{A focal outbreak of malaria at Sialimal sub-centre of Balasore district
   of Orissa was reported during the month of March, 2010. Three villages
   of the above block were affected. Regional Medical Research Centre,
   Bhubaneswar has conducted an entomological survey and a central clinic
   simultaneously, with door to door household survey to identify the fever
   cases. Within a span of 18 days around 172 fever cases were reported
   with Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) of 24.4\% and Pf \% of 81\%. The
   malaria epidemiological data of the sub-centre area for last three years
   indicates that the area is non endemic for malaria (API was 0.81).
   Entomological survey revealed the presence of three known vectors of
   malaria i.e. Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles annularis and Anopheles
   subpictus (local vector). Per Man Hour Density (PMHD) of these three
   species were 4.2, 2.8 and 10.8 respectively. Plasmodium falciparum
   sporozoites were detected in two An. culicifacies, in one An. annularis
   and in one An. subpictus. Larval density of Anopheline mosquitoes per
   dip ranged between 12 to 20. The vectors were found to be resistant to
   DDT but susceptible to synthetic pyrethroid. With this finding necessary
   remedial measures were taken by the government to curtail the
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The bio-efficacy of Solanum xanthocarpum leaf extract and bacterial
   insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis, were assessed against the first to
   fourth instar larvae and pupae of Culex quinquefasciatus, under the
   laboratory conditions. The medicinal plants were collected from the
   outskirt Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The shade
   dried plant materials were extracted by employing the Soxhlet apparatus
   with ethanol (organic solvent) for 8 h and filtered. The extracts were
   concentrated at reduced temperature on a rotary evaporator and stored at
   a temperature of 4A degrees C. Both S. xanthocarpum and B. thuringiensis
   show varied degree of larvicidal and pupicidal activity against various
   stages of C. quinquefasciatus. The LC50 and LC90 of S. xanthocarpum
   against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae were 155.29, 198.32,
   271.12, 377.44, and 448.41 ppm and 687.14, 913.10, 1,011.89, 1,058.85,

   xanthocarpum and B. thuringiensis materials could serve as a potential
   of highest mortality rate against the mosquito larvae laboratory as well

Abstract = {{Anopheles philippinensis-nivipes species of mosquitoes are considered
   secondary malaria vectors in the north-east India. However, difficulty
   in separating An. philippinensis and An. nivipes accurately on the basis
   of morphological identification, due to the overlapping female wing
   characters, has led to the paucity of information on their spatial
   distribution and vectorial importance, essential for understanding
   malaria disease epidemiology in areas under their influence. In view of
   this a study was undertaken to generate authentic information on
   distribution of An. philippinensis and An. nivipes in the north-east
   India using molecular tools. Between the two, An. nivipes was recorded
   as the dominant species in Assam, and Nagaland states whereas An.
   philippinensis was found predominant in the state of Mizoram and
   Arunachal Pradesh. Species differentiation based on female wing
   characters proved wrong in about 74\% specimens of An. philippinensis
   but found accurate in case of An. nivipes. No intra-specific variation
   in second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of ribosomal

Title = {{Age-Dependent Sex Bias in Clinical Malarial Disease in Hypoendemic
   Regions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Experimental models show a male bias in
   murine malaria; however, extant literature on biases in human clinical
   malaria is inconclusive. Studies in hyperendemic areas document an
   absence of sexual dimorphism in clinical malaria. Data on sex bias in
   clinical malaria in hypoendemic areas is ambiguous-some reports note a
   male bias but do not investigate the role of differential mosquito
   exposure in that bias. Moreover, these studies do not examine whether
   the bias is age related. This study investigates whether clinical
   malaria in hypoendemic regions exhibits a sex bias and whether this bias
   is age-dependent. We also consider the role of vector exposure in this
   bias.
   Methods: Retrospective passive clinical malaria datasets (2002-2007) and
   active surveillance datasets (2000-2009) were captured for the
   hypoendemic Mumbai region in Western India. To validate findings,
   passive retrospective data was captured from a primary malaria clinic
   (2006-2007) in hypoendemic Rourkela (Eastern India). Data was normalized
   by determining percent slide-positivity rates (SPRs) for males and
   females, and parasite-positivity distributions were established across
   age groups. The Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and
   Chi-square analysis were used to determine statistical significances.
   Results: In both the Mumbai and Rourkela regions, clinical malaria
   exhibited an adult male bias (p<0.01). A sex bias was not observed in
   children aged <= 10. Post-puberty, male SPRs were significantly greater
   than females SPRs (p<0.01). This adult male bias was observed for both
   vivax and falciparum clinical disease. Analysis of active surveillance
   data did not reveal an age or sex bias in the frequency of parasite
   positivity.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates an age-dependent sex bias in
   clinical malaria in hypoendemic regions and enhanced incidence of
   clinical malaria in males following puberty. Possible roles of sex
   hormones, vector exposure, co-infections, and other factors in this
   enhanced susceptibility are discussed.}},

   evaporated to dryness in rotary vacuum evaporator. Larvicidal properties
   of ethanolic leaf extracts showed that the extracts are effective as
   mosquito control agents. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h
   exposure. No mortality was observed in the control. The median lethal

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles baimaii is a primary vector of human malaria in
   the forest settings of Southeast Asia including the north-eastern region
   of India. Here, the genetic population structure and the basic
   population genetic parameters of An. baimaii in north-east India were
   estimated using DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
   sub unit II (COII) gene.
   Methods: Anopheles baimaii were collected from 26 geo-referenced
   locations across the seven north-east Indian states and the COII gene
   was sequenced from 176 individuals across these sites. Fifty-seven COII
   sequences of An. baimaii from six locations in Bangladesh, Myanmar and
   Thailand from a previous study were added to this dataset. Altogether,
   233 sequences were grouped into eight population groups, to facilitate
   analyses of genetic diversity, population structure and population
   history.
   Results: A star-shaped median joining haplotype network, unimodal
   mismatch distribution and significantly negative neutrality tests
   indicated population expansion in An. baimaii with the start of
   expansion estimated to be similar to 0.243 million years before present
   (MYBP) in north-east India. The populations of An. baimaii from
   north-east India had the highest haplotype and nucleotide diversity with
   all other populations having a subset of this diversity, likely as the
   result of range expansion from north-east India. The north-east Indian
   populations were genetically distinct from those in Bangladesh, Myanmar
   and Thailand, indicating that mountains, such as the Arakan mountain
   range between north-east India and Myanmar, are a significant barrier to
   gene flow. Within north-east India, there was no genetic differentiation
   among populations with the exception of the Central 2 population in the
   Barail hills area that was significantly differentiated from other
   populations.
   Conclusions: The high genetic distinctiveness of the Central 2
   population in the Barail hills area of the north-east India should be
   confirmed and its epidemiological significance further investigated. The
   lack of genetic population structure in the other north-east Indian
   populations likely reflects large population sizes of An. baimaii that,
   historically, were able to disperse through continuous forest habitats
   in the north-east India. Additional markers and analytical approaches
   are required to determine if recent deforestation is now preventing
   ongoing gene flow. Until such information is acquired, An. baimaii in
   north-east India should be treated as a single unit for the
   implementation of vector control measures.}},

Title = {{Impact of changing over of insecticide from synthetic pyrethroids to DDT
   for indoor residual spray in a malaria endemic area of Orissa, India}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Development of insecticide resistance in
   malaria vectors has been a major problem for achieving effective vector
   control. Due to limited availability of insecticides, the only option is
   management of resistance by judiciously using the insecticides and
   rotating them to maintain their effectiveness. This study was carried
   out in a malaria endemic area of Sundergarh district in Orissa where
   synthetic pyrethroids (SP) were in use for the last couple of years. The
   change-over from SP to DDT was done in one arm of study, and the other
   two arms remained on SP and insecticide-treated nets (ITN).
   Entomological and parasitological monitoring was done to assess the
   impact.
   Methods: The study design comprised of three arms (i) two rounds of
   indoor residual spraying (IRS) with DDT 1g/m(2) as a change-over
   insecticide in areas previously under synthetic pyrethroids; (ii) two
   rounds of IRS with synthetic pyrethroid (alphacypermethrin, ACM) @ 25
   mg/m(2); and (iii) an unsprayed area under ITN/long lasting insecticide
   nets (LNs). Indoor residual spraying was undertaken under strict
   supervision to maintain quality and coverage. Contact bioassays were
   conducted to know the persistence of insecticide on sprayed surfaces and
   adult vector density was monitored in fixed and randomly selected
   houses. Malaria incidence was measured through fortnightly domiciliary
   surveillance under primary health care system in all the study villages.
   Results: The insecticide susceptibility tests showed thatAn.culicifacies
   was resistant to DDT but susceptible to malathion and ACM. However, An.
   fluviatilis was susceptible to all the three insecticides. ACM was
   effective in killing An. culicifacies on mud and wooden sprayed surfaces
   and maintained effective bioefficacy ranging from 92 to 100 per cent up
   to five months, whereas DDT failed to achieve effective mortality in
   An.culicifacies. However, there was significant decline in the density
   of An.culicifacies in ACM and DDT areas in comparison to ITNs/LNs. There
   was 61 per cent reduction in the slide positivity rate in ACM area in
   comparison to 48 and 51 per cent in DDT and ITN/LNs areas, respectively.
   The adjusted incidence rate of malaria cases per 1000 population in
   three study areas also showed significant declines within each group.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The present findings show that the
   change-over of insecticide from synthetic pyrethroids to DDT brings
   about the same epidemiological impact as envisaged from continuing SP
   spray or distributing insecticide treated nets/long-lasting insecticidal
   nets provided there is a good quality spray and house coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquito distribution and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection
   were studied in a bat cave and its surrounding area in Lopburi province,
   central Thailand. Mosquitoes were collect from May 2009 to April 2010 by
   using CO2-baited CDC-light traps, and dry ice as a source of CO2 to
   attract mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were identified and tested for JEV
   infection by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR). Five genera of mosquitoes collected from the bat cave include
   Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Uranotaenia, and eight genera of
   mosquitoes collected from the area close to the bat cave include Aedes,
   Aedeomyia, Anopheles, Armigeres, Coquillettidia, Culex, Mansonia and
   Uranotaenia. The dominant species of the collected mosquitoes from these
   two areas were Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Ar.
   subalbatus. There was only one species of blood-fed mosquitoes collected
   from the bat cave in this study, which was Cx. quinquefasciatus. Blood
   meal identification based on cytochrome b sequences in this study
   indicated that all mosquito blood meals were blood from the fruit bat,
   Rousettus leschenaulti. A total of 61 pools of mosquitoes were collected
   from the bat cave: six pools of Ar. subalbatus, one pool of Cx. gelidus,
   39 pools of Cx. quinquefasciatus and 15 pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.
   A total of 110 pools of mosquitoes were collected from the area close to
   the bat cave: six pools of Ae. albopictus, three pools of An. Stephensi,
   23 pools of Ar. Subalbatus, two pools of Cx. gelidus, 36 pools Cx
   quinquefasciatus and 40 pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Each of these
   pools in this study, which contains 10 mosquitoes was tested for JEV
   infection by using RT-PCR, and all of them were negative.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is a major public health problem in India and one which
   contributes significantly to the overall malaria burden in Southeast
   Asia. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program of India
   reported similar to 1.6 million cases and 1100 malaria deaths in 2009.
   Some experts argue that this is a serious underestimation and that the
   actual number of malaria cases per year is likely between 9 and 50 times
   greater. with an approximate 13-fold underestimation of malaria-related
   mortality. The difficulty in making these estimations is further
   exacerbated by (i) highly variable malaria eco-epidemiological profiles,
   (ii) the transmission and overlap of multiple Plasmodium species and
   Anopheles vectors, (iii) increasing antimalarial drug resistance and
   insecticide resistance, and (iv) the impact of climate change on each of
   these variables. Simply stated, the burden of malaria in India is
   complex. Here we describe plans for a Center for the Study of Complex
   Malaria in India (CSCMi), one of ten International Centers of Excellence
   in Malaria Research (ICEMRs) located in malarious regions of the world
   recently funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
   Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The CSCMi is a close
   partnership between Indian and United States scientists, and aims to
   address major gaps in our understanding of the complexity of malaria in
   India, including changing patterns of epidemiology, vector biology and
   control, drug resistance, and parasite genomics. We hope that such a
   multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical and field studies
   with laboratory, molecular, and genomic methods will provide a powerful
   combination for malaria control and prevention in India. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends several brands of long
   lasting insecticidal net (LN) for protection against insect vectors but
   also advises national programmes to monitor and evaluate performance
   under local conditions to help them select the most suitable LN for
   their setting. During the course of a community randomised trial of LNs
   against visceral leishmaniasis in northern India and Nepal, opportunity
   arose to assess the efficacy of PermaNet 2.0 (Vestergaard-Frandsen,
   Denmark) after two years of use against sandfly vectors. Between 63\%
   (India) and 78\% (Nepal) of LNs became holed over the course of two
   years, deltamethrin residues fell from 55 mg/m(2) to an average of 11.6
   mg/m(2) (India) and 27.9 mg/m(2) (Nepal), but on the basis of bioassay
   criteria all LNs tested still met the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme
   standard for LN effectiveness. Nets had on average only been washed 2.5
   times (India) and 0.6 times (Nepal) by householders over the course of
   two years. The loss of insecticide was attributed to factors which had
   little or nothing to do with washing, such as handling, friction and
   torsion during daily use. Under conditions pertaining in this region of
   south Asia, and for two years at least, this brand of net continues to
   meet the criteria established by WHO for LNs. (C) 2011 Royal Society of

Abstract = {{Bashagard is an important malaria endemic area in south of Iran. An
   epidemiological and entomological survey was performed during 2002-2010.
   The aim of study was to determine malaria situation, species composition
   of anopheline mosquitoes and susceptibility status of main vectors to
   insecticides/larvicides. A total of 13,490 malaria cases were recorded,
   Plasmodium vivax (99.64\%), P. falciparum (0.35\%) and mix cases
   (0.01\%). The highest and lowest Annual Parasite Incidence (API) were
   observed in 2007(145.72/1000) and 2009(6.29/1000), respectively.
   Anopheles culicifacies, An. dthali, An. stephensi, An. superpictus, An.
   fluviatilis, An. moghulensis, An. turkhudi and An. apoci were collected
   from the area. Two peak activities occur in April and October. The first
   five species were confirmed as malaria vectors in Iran. No indication of
   sporozoite in mosquitoes using molecular method was performed.
   Susceptibility tests using diagnostic dose of insecticides and
   larvicides showed only resistance of An. stephensi to DDT. Tolerance in
   An. stephensi to deltamethrin and bendiocarb is reported. The same
   phenomenon was observed in An. culicifacies to DDT, propoxur and delta
   methrin, and in An. dthali to malathion and deltamethrin. Larvae of
   vectors were susceptible to all larvicides, except for An. stephensi
   that exhibited tolerance to fenthion. In conclusion it should be
   emphasized that malaria transmission is a complex process in Bashagard.
   This event is attributed to five proven vectors with different behaviors
   which are active in the area. Regarding tolerance of vectors to
   deltamethrin, resistance management is suggested by using new
   insecticide with novel mode of action. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The leaf extract of Acalypha alnifolia with different solvents - hexane,
   chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol - were tested for
   larvicidal activity against three important mosquitoes such as malarial
   vector, Anopheles stephensi, dengue vector, Aedes aegypti and
   Bancroftian filariasis vector, Culex quinquefasciatus. The medicinal
   plants were collected from the area around Kallar Hills near the Western
   Ghats, Coimbatore, India. A. alnifolia plant was washed with tap water
   and shade dried at room temperature. The dried leaves were powdered
   mechanically using commercial electrical stainless steel blender. The
   powder 800 g of the leaf material was extract with 2.5 litre of various
   each organic solvents such as hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate,
   acetone, methanol for 8 h using Soxhlet apparatus, and filtered. The
   crude plant extracts were evaporated to dryness in a rotary vacuum
   evaporator. The yield of extracts was hexane (8.64 g), chloroform (10.74
   g), ethyl acetate (9.14 g), acetone (10.02 g), and methanol (11.43 g).
   One gram of the each plant residue was dissolved separately in 100 ml of
   acetone (stock solution) from which different concentrations, i.e., 50,
   150, 250, 350 and 450 ppm, was prepared. The hexane, chloroform, ethyl
   acetate, acetone was moderate considerable mortality; however, the
   highest larval mortality was methanolic extract observed in three
   mosquito vectors. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure.
   No mortality was observed in the control. The early fourth-instar larvae
   of A. stephensi had values of LC50 = 197.37, 178.75, 164.34, 149.90 and
   125.73 ppm and LC90 = 477.60, 459.21, 435.07, 416.20 and 395.50 ppm,
   respectively. The A. aegypti had values of LC50 = 202.15, 182.58,
   160.35, 146.07 and 128.55 ppm and LC90 = 476.57, 460.83, 440.78, 415.38
   and 381.67 ppm, respectively. The C. quinquefasciatus had values of LC50
   = 198.79, 172.48, 151.06, 140.69 and 127.98 ppm and LC90 = 458.73,
   430.66, 418.78, 408.83 and 386.26 ppm, respectively. The results of the
   leaf extract of A. alnifloia are promising as good larvicidal activity

Abstract = {{Assam-Arunachal forest fringed foothill area is endemic for malaria
   incidence. The present study deals with the temporal analysis of malaria
   incidence and determines its association with deforestation in 24
   villages along the Assam-Arunachal forest fringed foothill area of
   Sonitpur district of Assam. Malaria epidemiological survey has been
   carried out in the study area from the year 1994 to 2005. Remote sensing
   (RS) technique has been used to map the areas of forest changes from the
   year 2000 to 2005. Geographical information system (GIS) was used to map
   the malaria incidence and forest cover. The study villages are endemic
   to malaria infections and there was increasing trend of malaria
   incidence over the years. The slide positivity rate (SPR) ranged from
   5.1\% in 1997 to 44.4\% in 2005. The percentage forest cover decreased
   significantly from 23.6\% during 2000 to 15.4\% during 2005, whereas SPR
   was increased during 2000-2005. The present study is the first attempt
   to understand the role of deforestation in malaria incidence using RS
   and GIS in the north-eastern region of India at a micro-geographic
   level. The study suggests that the area is endemic to malaria
   transmission. The decrease in forest cover is a serious ecological
   concern besides its role in elevating the malaria incidence in the study
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Knowledge of the bionomics of mosquitoes,
   especially of disease vectors, is essential to plan appropriate vector
   avoidance and control strategies. Information on biting activity of
   vectors during the night hours in different seasons is important for
   choosing personal protection measures. This study was carried out to
   find out the composition of mosquito fauna biting on humans and seasonal
   biting trends in Goa, India.
   Methods: Biting activities of all mosquitoes including vectors were
   studied from 1800 to 0600 h during 85 nights using human volunteers in
   14 different localities of three distinct ecotypes in Goa. Seasonal
   biting trends of vector species were analysed and compared. Seasonal
   biting periodicity during different phases of night was also studied
   using William's mean.
   Results: A total of 4,191 mosquitoes of five genera and 23 species were
   collected. Ten species belonged to Anopheles, eight to Culex, three to
   Aedes and one each to Mansonia and Armigeres. Eleven vector species had
   human hosts, including malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi (1.3\%), An.
   fluviatilis (1.8\%), and An. culicifacies (0.76\%); filariasis vectors
   Culex quinquefasciatus (40.8\%) and Mansonia uniformis (1.8\%); Japanese
   encephalitis vectors Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (17.4\%), Cx. vishnui
   (7.7\%), Cx. pseudovishnui (0.1\%), and Cx. gelidus (2.4\%); and dengue
   and chikungunya vectors Aedes albopictus (0.9\%) and Ae. aegypti
   (0.6\%). Two An. stephensi of the total 831 female anophelines, were
   found positive for R falciparum sporozoites. The entomological
   inoculation rate (EIR) of P falciparum was 18.1 and 2.35 for Panaji city
   and Goa, respectively.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Most of the mosquito vector species were
   collected in all seasons and throughout the scotophase. Biting rates of
   different vector species differed during different phases of night and
   seasons. Personal protection methods could be used to stop vector-host

Abstract = {{Malaria is a major health problem in India especially in the north-east
   region. Various methods to combat malaria have been adopted in this
   region but this problem is yet not under control as all the states
   report perennial morbidity and mortality due to malaria. The control
   programmes jeopardized due to improper implementation, inadequate
   surveillance and lack of geo-referenced information to pinpoint the
   trouble spots for timely preventive actions. In this investigation an
   information management system has been constructed based on geographical
   information system (GIS) for Udalguri district using sub-centre wise
   malaria data for quick retrieval of information and generation of maps
   which highlight malaria hot spots. Out of a total of 144 sub-centres,
   GIS identified 11 sub-centres as malaria hot spots based on annual
   parasitic incidence >5 and Plasmodium falciparum >30\% consistently for
   3 years (2006-2008). The district health authorities were advised to
   focus malaria control in these hot pockets on a priority basis. GIS
   mapping enables easy update of information which permits policymakers to
   formulate focused and cost-effective malaria control strategy for
   endemic areas.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of whole plant extracts of Leucas aspera and Bacillus
   sphaericus has been proven against larvicidal and pupicidal activities
   of the malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi. The present study
   investigated the larvicidal and pupicidal activity against the first to
   fourth instar lavae and pupae of the laboratory-reared mosquitoes, A.
   stephensi. The medicinal plants were collected from the area around
   Maruthamalai hills, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. L. aspera whole plant
   was washed with tap water and shade dried at room temperature. The dried
   plant materials were powdered by an electric blender. From the powder,
   100 g of the plant materials was extracted with 300 ml of organic
   solvents of ethanol for 8 h using a Soxhlet apparatus. The extracts were
   filtered through a Buchner funnel with Whatman number 1 filter paper.
   The crude plant extracts were evaporated to dryness in a rotary vacuum
   evaporator. The plant extract showed larvicidal and pupicidal effects
   after 24 h of exposure. All larval instars and pupae have considerably
   moderate mortality; however, the highest larval mortality was the
   ethanolic extract of whole plant L. aspera against the first to fourth
   instar larvae and pupae values of LC50=I instar was 9.695\%, II instar
   was 10.272\%, III instar was 10.823\%, and IV instar was 11.303\%, and
   pupae was 12.732\%. B. spaericus against the first to fouth instar
   larvae and pupae had the following values: I instar was 0.051\%, II
   instar was 0.057\%, III instar was 0.062\%, IV instar was 0.066\%, and
   for the pupae was 0.073\%. No mortality was observed in the control. The
   present results suggest that the ethanolic extracts of L. aspera and B.
   sphaericus provided an excellent potential for controlling of malarial
   vector, A. stephensi.}},

Title = {{Molecular evidence for the presence of malaria vector species a of the
   Anopheles annularis complex in Sri Lanka}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles annularis s.l. is a wide spread malaria vector in
   South and Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka. The taxon An. annularis
   is a complex of two sibling species viz. A and B, that are
   differentiated by chromosome banding patterns and ribosomal gene
   sequences in India. Only species A is reported to be a malaria vector in
   India while the occurrence of sibling species in Sri Lanka has not been
   documented previously.
   Findings: Anopheline larvae were collected at a site in the Jaffna
   district, which lies within the dry zone of Sri Lanka, and reared in the
   laboratory. Emerged adults were identified using standard keys. DNA
   sequences of the D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the internal
   transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) of the morphologically identified An.
   annularis were determined. BLASTn searches against corresponding An.
   annularis sequences in GenBank and construction of phylogenetic trees
   from D3 and ITS-2 rDNA sequences showed that the Sri Lankan specimens,
   and An. annularis s.l. specimens from several Southeast Asian countries
   were closely related to species A of the Indian An. annularis complex.
   Conclusions: The results show the presence of the malaria vector An.
   annularis species A in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Because An.
   annularis vectors have been long associated with malaria transmission in
   irrigated agricultural areas in the Sri Lankan dry zone, continued
   monitoring of An. annularis populations, and their sibling species
   status, in these areas need to be integral to malaria control and
   eradication efforts in the island.}},

   urban malaria vector in India. We assessed the wash resistance and
   efficacy of these nets in relation to bloodfeeding inhibition and
   percent mortality in cone and tunnel test bioassays. Both Olyset and
   Permanet showed >80\% mortality of An. stephensi in cone bioassays after
   20 washes. In tunnel tests there was no significant difference between
   Olyset and Permanet 2.0 in causing total mosquito mortality (immediate
   and delayed) up to 10 washes and bloodfeeding inhibition and entry rate
   up to 15 washes. After the 20th wash, Permanet 2.0 was significantly
   more effective than the Olyset net in causing total mosquito mortality,
   whereas Olyset net showed less bloodfeeding and entry of mosquitoes as
   compared to Permanet 2.0. There was a gradual decline in efficacy of
   both LLIN products as the number of washings increased. Cone bioassays
   indicated a strong wash resistance in both the LLIN products after 20
   washes. However, the tunnel tests demonstrated a gradual decline in
   efficacy of both products with the number of washings.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria in migrant workers is always a major problem to control due to
   their temporary stay in shelters, and other operational constraints.
   Hence, a study was undertaken in brick kilns in Bharuch district,
   Gujarat state, India to study the problem of malaria in the work force.
   Mass blood surveys were carried out in 15 brick kilns. Blood slides were
   collected from both febrile and afebrile cases. Positive cases were
   treated as per the national drug policy and were followed up. Mosquito
   collections were carried out by pyrethrum spray collection in early
   morning hours. Human blood index and sporozoite rates were determined as
   per standard procedures. All age groups were found affected with malaria
   at brick kilns. Prevalence of malaria was significantly higher in <= 14
   years of age-group as compared to adults. Post treatment follow up
   examination of patients revealed high malaria infection due to
   non-compliance of chloroquine. The appearance of parasitaemia among
   Plasmodium falciparum treated cases indicate the possibility of
   chloroquine resistance. The proportion of P falciparum was >50\% in
   migrant population. In stable population in villages, overall decline in
   malaria cases Was observed in 2008-2010. The sporozoite rate of 4.2\% in
   Anopheles culicifacies indicates active malaria transmission at brick
   kilns. The investigation demonstrated that suitable microclimatic
   conditions for malaria transmission exist in these areas during hottest
   period. The district health department should consider these factors in
   planning malaria surveillance and control. As current magnitude and
   diversity of population movements in rural as well as in urban areas are
   unprecedented, this issue is worthy of attention.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Certain indigenous fish can play potential
   role in vector control. The study recorded distribution of Aphanius
   dispar (Ruppell) in its native habitats in Gujarat, India and evaluated
   its larval propensity for Indian mosquito vectors.
   Methods: Fishes were surveyed in various districts of Gujarat and
   samples were collected from coastal habitats and were identified to
   species. Physicochemical properties of water samples were analysed in
   the laboratory. Five laboratory acclimatized adult fish (2.2-3 cm)
   released in chlorine-free water in glass jars were provided with 500
   larvae daily. Five replicates were run. Daily consumption of I to IV
   instars of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus
   was recorded separately for three days. Anopheles stephensi larval
   control using the fish in industrial tanks (9-180 m(2)) was evaluated.
   Results \& conclusion: The fish was found in large numbers in estuarine
   waters, rivulets, backwaters and small dams in the districts of Kutch,
   Jamnagar, Patan and Anand in Gujarat. Mean daily consumption of larvae
   in laboratory was as follows: An. stephensi 128 +/- 0.2 to 204 +/- 6;
   Cx. quinquefasciatus 24 +/- 4 to 58 +/- 10; Ae. aegypti 43 +/- 5 to 68
   +/- 2. In water tanks, A. dispar reduced 93\% larval counts by Day 7 and
   98\% by Day 21 (p <0.01), showing high larval propensity. A consolidated
   information on bionomics, tolerance and physicochemical properties of
   water taken from natural habitats of A. dispar indicate its high
   larvivorous potential. Large-scale evaluation is warranted to evaluate
   its potential in vector-borne disease control.}},

   culture supernatant of the bacterium and its efficacy against the larval
   and pupal stages of different species of mosquitoes was determined in
   terms of LC(50) and LC(90). Mosquito larvicidal activity in terms of
   LC(50) against Anopheles stephensi. Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes

Abstract = {{In recent years, uses of environment friendly and biodegradable natural
   insecticides of plant origin have received renewed attention as agents
   for vector control. The present study was undertaken to investigate the
   effect of aril and kernel extracts of Knema attenuata (Hook. f. \&
   Thomson) Warb. (Myristicaceae) on larvae of Aedes albopictus Skuse and
   Anopheles stephensi Liston under laboratory conditions. The aril was
   extracted with chloroform and ethanol; the kernel was extracted with
   ethanol and hexane. The extracts were tested against the 3rd-4th instar
   larvae collected from Bunder area, Mangalore, India, which is a
   well-known fishing harbour, where several mosquito-borne diseases were
   reported. All the graded concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ppm)
   showed significant larval mortality after 24 h of observation.
   Chloroform extracts of aril showed 100\% mortality against both larval
   forms of A. albopictus and A. stephensi at the concentration of 500 ppm.
   Among the extracts tested, chloroform extracts of aril and ethanol
   extracts of kernel exhibited higher toxicity against both A. albopictus
   (LC50, 141 ppm and 159 ppm; LC90, 290 ppm and 342 ppm) and A. stephensi
   (LC50, 160 ppm and 162 ppm; LC90, 445 ppm and 458 ppm). Hexane extracts
   of kernel exhibited least toxicity against A. albopictus (LC50, 239 ppm;
   LC90, 484 ppm), whereas ethanol extracts of aril showed the least
   toxicity against A. stephensi (LC50, 290; LC90, 498). A preliminary
   phytochemical assay revealed the presence of phenolics, tannins,
   steroids, terpenes, resins, and glycolipids in all the extracts.
   Alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins were absent. The lower LC50 value of
   the chloroform extracts of K. attenuata aril indicates its potentiality
   as a larvicide against A. albopictus and A. stephensi mosquito larvae.}},

Title = {{Variations of insecticide residual bio-efficacy on different types of
   walls: results from a community-based trial in south Cameroon}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Determination of residual activity of insecticides is
   essential information for the selection of appropriate indoor spraying
   operation. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the residual
   effect of three candidate insecticide formulations on different indoor
   surfaces in order to guide future interventions, in the context of
   Cameroon and other African countries.
   Methods: The study was conducted in the Ntougou neighbourhood in Yaounde
   (capital city of Cameroon). Bendiocarb WP, lambda-cyhalothrin CS and
   deltamethrin WG were sprayed on the indoor wall surfaces of local
   cement, wood and mud houses. Their effects on the knockdown and
   mortality of the Kisumu susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae s.s were
   assessed each month from March to September 2009, using the WHO plastic
   cones test. Knockdown and mortality rates were compared between
   different surfaces using Chi-square test. A Kaplan-Meir model was used
   to estimate the time of treatment failure.
   Results: With bendiocarb WP, the knockdown rates were frequently above
   98\% during 13 weeks after spraying, except on mud walls where it
   significantly decreased at the 13(th) week (P < 0.05). With lambda
   cyhalothrin CS, the knockdown rates remained 100\% on wood surfaces
   during the 26 weeks trial. However, it significantly decreased on
   concrete and mud surfaces from the 11(th) (83\%) and the 20(th) (88\%)
   weeks respectively (P < 0.05). With deltamethrin WG, it remained high on
   concrete surfaces during 26 weeks (> 98\%); while it varied between 60
   and 100\% on wood or mud surfaces. The survival estimates of bendiocarb
   WP treatments remaining effective in killing An. gambiae s.s. (mortality
   rate >= 80\%) was > 13 weeks on cement and wood surfaces and 13 weeks on
   mud surfaces. Those of lambda-cyhalothrin CS were > 26 weeks on wood
   surfaces, and 20 weeks on concrete and mud surfaces. By contrast, those
   of deltamethrin WG were 26 weeks on concrete, 20 weeks on mud surfaces
   and 15 weeks on wood surfaces.
   Conclusion: Current data suggest variable durations of spray cycles for
   each product, according to the type of wall surfaces, highlighting the
   importance of testing candidate products in local context before using
   them in large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Prevention of malaria is a major technical and
   operational problem in displaced and mobile populations such as refugee
   camps and temporary labour settlements. Insecticide incorporated plastic
   sheeting is a new technology to control mosquitoes in emergency shelters
   and also temporary habitations at different locations. In view of this,
   efficacy of ZeroFly (R), an insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting
   (factory treated with deltamethrin 2.0 g/kg or 265 mg/m(2)) was
   evaluated for its efficacy against malaria vectors and its impact on
   malaria incidence in temporary labour settlements in two urban areas in
   India.
   Methods: This trial was conducted in two labour settlements in two urban
   areas, Delhi and Noida (U.P.), India with similar to 250 populations. In
   an area, two localities were selected for intervention with ZeroFly and
   untreated plastic sheets (control). Entomological and epidemiological
   data were collected using standard methods for one year.
   Results: Baseline studies on the susceptibility of mosquitoes in Delhi
   and Noida areas revealed 100\% susceptibility of the malaria vector
   species Anopheles culicifacies and An. stephensi to deltamethrin. Cone
   bioassay tests performed against An. culicifacies and An stephensi to
   determine the efficacy of ZeroFly sheets showed 100\% mortality against
   An. culicifacies and An. stephensi with 3 min exposure and after 24 h
   recovery period. Against Culex quinquefasciatus and housefly 100\%
   mortality was obtained after 30 min of exposure period. Intervention
   with the ZeroFly plastic sheets resulted in almost complete reduction in
   the resting density of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi, the two major
   malaria vectors and also in the reduction of malaria cases in ZeroFly
   camps as compared to control camps. The ZeroFly plastic sheeting was
   found to be safe for human. Barring some complaints of skin irritation
   and itching, which were temporary in nature, no adverse health effects
   were reported by the users. The community acceptance was high.
   Conclusion: Results of the present study revealed that ZeroFly (R)
   plastic sheeting is highly effective in reducing the indoor resting
   density of mosquitoes, man-vector contact and malaria incidences in
   labour populations living in temporary shelters.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Midge egg masses are reported to support non pathogenic
   strains of the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholera (V. cholera). Mosquito
   born diseases have been reported to cause millions of death worldwide.
   The present research reveals the toxicity effect of spinosad and neem
   seed kernel extract (NSKE) against different larval stages of Anopheles
   stephensi (An. stephensi) and Chironomus circumdatus (Ch. circumdatus).
   Methods: The neem seeds were collected from Marudamalai hills,
   Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India. Neem seed kernels were
   powdered, extracted and diluted for different concentrations (2 ppm to
   10 ppm). Spinosad was purchased from Kalpatharu pesticide Limited,
   Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India and thoroughly mixed with distilled water
   to prepare various concentrations (0.01 to 0.08 ppm) and used for
   bioassay. The results depict that spinosad is more toxic in lower
   concentrations when compared to NSKE and mosquitoes are more susceptible
   than chironomids. Lethal concentrations were evaluated using the
   observed mortality. The lowest LC(50) value obtained from spinosad
   against An. stephensi and Ch. circumdatus were 0.002 05 ppm and 0.008 91
   ppm. This study investigated on effect of Spinosad and NSKE on the
   biology of mosquito. The immature stages of both species were
   susceptible to Spinosad and NSKE. Spinosad and NSKE in individual as
   well as combined treatment provided additional days in development for
   mosquitoes. Conclusions: The results conclude that Spinosad and NSKE are
   potential larvicides against An. stephensi and Ch. circumdatus.}},

Abstract = {{North-east India is co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax
   malaria, and disease transmission is perennial and persistent. This
   study reports the results of a field-based village scale trial of
   deltamethrin incorporated long-lasting polyethylene netting (Netprotect
   (R)) conducted in P. falciparum predominant pocket of Assam, north-east
   India to assess operational feasibility, acceptability and
   sustainability against disease vectors and malaria transmission. The
   study monitored the residual efficacy of the long-lasting net in
   relation to serial washings in the laboratory and malaria prevalence in
   experimental villages for the first year of investigations from
   September 2008 to June 2009. The mosquito vector populations of
   Anopheles minimus were observed to be highly susceptible to deltamethrin
   (0.05\%), and follow up investigations revealed that the vector mosquito
   had virtually disappeared in Netprotect (R) intervention villages.
   Concurrently, there was consistent decline in malaria cases in
   Netprotect (R) villages and transmission reduction was statistically
   significant compared to untreated net (net without insecticide) and
   no-net control villages for the corresponding study period. The contact
   cone-bioassay investigations against malaria transmitting mosquito
   species revealed that the bioavailability of the insecticide on the net
   fiber was persistent up to 20th serial wash resulting in >= 80\%
   mortality. Community compliance and acceptance were high, and users
   reported decreased nuisance due to biting mosquitoes. It was concluded
   that deltamethrin incorporated polyethylene long-lasting netting was
   safe, wash-resistant, and assessed to be an operationally feasible,

Abstract = {{The genus Asaia (family Acetobacteraceae) was first introduced with a
   single species-Asaia bogorensis and later six more species were
   described namely A. siamensis, A. krungthepensis, A. lannaensis, A.
   platycodi, A. prunellae, and A. astilbes. Acetobacteraceae family has
   been divided into ten genera but, only three of them include nitrogen
   fixing species: Gluconacetobacter, Acetobacter, and Swaminathania. This
   article originated from our study primarily aimed to isolate new
   endosymbiotic nitrogen fixer among Acetobacteraceae during which we have
   isolated, for the first time in India, four different strains of Asaia
   sp. from three different sources: Michalia champaca flower, Anopheles
   mosquito, and ant Tetraponera rufonigra. All the endosymbiotic strains
   isolated possess the ability to fix nitrogen. Evidence for both
   nitrogenase activity and the presence of nifH gene in isolated Asaia sp.
   is presented. Asaia bogorensis (MTCC 4041(T)) and A. siamensis (MTCC
   4042(T)), two of the validated type strains available from the
   repository, were tested positive for the presence of functional
   nitrogenase. The nifH gene sequences from these type strains were also
   confirmed and compared with other nitrogen fixing members of the family
   Acetobacteraceae. Our result corroborate with the previous reports that
   Asaia sp. are indeed widely distributed in nature but this is the first
   time demonstration of their functional nitrogenase activity. This study
   shows Asaia sp. as fourth genera of nitrogen fixing bacteria in the
   family Acetobacteraceae.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases,
   causing millions of deaths every year and the development of resistance
   to chemical insecticides resulting in rebounding vectorial capacity.
   Plants may be alternative sources of mosquito control agents. The
   present study assessed the role of larvicidal activities of hexane,
   chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol dried leaf and bark
   extracts of Annona squamosa L., Chrysanthemum indicum L., and Tridax
   procumbens L. against the fourth instar larvae of malaria vector,
   Anopheles subpictus Grassi and Japanese encephalitis vector, Culex
   tritaeniorhynchus Giles (Diptera: Culicidae).
   Methods: Larvicidal activities of three medicinal plant extracts were
   studied in the range of 4.69 to 1000 mg/l in the laboratory bioassays
   against early 4(th) instar larvae of An. subpictus and Cx.
   tritaeniorhynchus. The mortality data were subjected to probit analysis
   to determine the lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) to kill 50 and 90
   per cent of the treated larvae of the respective species.
   Results: All plant extracts showed moderate effects after 24 h of
   exposure; however, the highest toxic effect of bark methanol extract of
   A. squamosa, leaf ethyl acetate extract of C. indicate; and leaf acetone
   extract of T. procumbens against the larvae of An. subpictus (LC50 =
   93.80, 39.98 and 51.57 mg/l) and bark methanol extract of A. squamosa,
   leaf methanol extract of C. indicant and leaf ethyl acetate extract of
   T. procumbens against the larvae of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC50=104.94,
   42.29 and 69.16 mg/l) respectively.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Our data suggest that the bark ethyl
   acetate and methanol extract of A. squamosa, leaf ethyl acetate and
   methanol extract of C. indicant, acetone and ethyl acetate extract of T.
   procumbens have the potential to be used as an ecofriendly approach for
   the control of the An. subpictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The environmental effect of Pleistocene climatic change in the
   Indo-Oriental region has resulted in allopatric fragmentation and the
   generation of diversity in forest-associated species. The aim of this
   study was to determine the extent to which Pleistocene climatic change
   has resulted in the fragmentation and speciation of an
   open-habitat-adapted mosquito, Anopheles vagus s.l., across its range.
   Location Anopheles vagus s.l. was sampled across the Indo-Oriental
   region.
   Methods We generated 116 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
   (COI) and 121 nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) DNA sequences
   from 18 populations. Relationships between mitochondrial haplotypes were
   reconstructed using minimum spanning networks, and population structure
   was examined using analyses of molecular variance. The population
   history, including lineage divergence times, population expansion and
   gene flow, was inferred using beast and the isolation with migration
   (IM) model.
   Results There was no evidence to support the presence of the endemic
   Philippines species, A. limosus; instead, Philippine populations were
   closely related to, and derived from, A. vagus on the eastern Southeast
   Asian mainland. The most distinct populations were those from Java and
   East Timor, which differed from all other populations by all individuals
   having a 4-bp insertion in the ITS2 sequence. The corresponding
   mitochondrial haplotypes had an estimated divergence time of 2.6 Ma
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-3.6 Ma]. Haplotype networks and
   analysis of molecular variance for COI supported western (Sri Lanka,
   India and Myanmar) and eastern (Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam
   and the Philippines) population groupings. This grouping structure
   results from the divergence of an eastern and a western mitochondrial
   lineage, estimated to have occurred 0.37 Ma (95\% CI 0.26-0.55 Ma).
   Subsequent migration from the east to the west (0.16 Ma) is inferred to
   have created an admixture zone in Myanmar and Thailand.
   Main conclusions With the possible exception of populations from Java
   and East Timor, A. vagus appears to be one widespread genetically
   diverse taxon across its extensive range. The abundance of grassland
   during long interglacial periods may have facilitated population
   connectivity and range expansion across the Oriental and western
   Australasian regions.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato, a widespread vector of
   malaria in Asia, is reportedly composed of four sibling species A-D
   based on distinct cytogenetic and morphological characteristics. However
   An. subpictus species B specimens in Sri Lanka are termed An. subpictus
   B/ An. sundaicus because of recent genetic data. Differences in salinity
   tolerance and coastal/inland prevalence of An. subpictus sibling species
   that were not previously established in Sri Lanka are presented here.
   Results: Specimens with morphological characteristics of all four Indian
   An. subpictus sibling species were found in Sri Lanka. Sibling species
   A, C and D tended to be predominant in inland, and An. subpictus species
   B/An. sundaicus, in coastal localities. Sibling species C was
   predominant in both adult and larval inland collections. Larvae of An.
   subpictus B/An. sundaicus were found in inland and coastal sites,
   including a lagoon, with salinity varying from 0 to 30 ppt. An.
   subpictus sibling species A, C and D larvae were present in water of
   salinity between 0 to 4 ppt. An. subpictus C, D and An. subpictus B/An.
   sundaicus larvae showed compatible differential salinity tolerance in
   laboratory tests. The first instar larvae of An. subpictus B/An.
   sundaicus showed 100\% survival up to 15 ppt in comparison to species C
   and D where the corresponding values were 3 ppt and 6 ppt respectively.
   However all third instar larvae of An. subpictus B/An. sundaicus
   survived up to 30 ppt salinity whereas An. subpictus C and D tolerated
   up to 4 ppt and 8 ppt salinity respectively.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that An. subpictus species B/An.
   sundaicus breed in fresh, brackish and nearly saline water while An.
   subpictus species C and D do so in fresh and less brackish waters in Sri
   Lanka, as in India. Because of the established role of An. sundaicus
   s.l. and An. subpictus s.l. as malaria vectors, the findings indicate a
   need for greater monitoring of brackish water breeding habitats in Asia.
   Tolerance to 15 ppt salinity may also constitute a simple method for
   differentiating An. subpictus B/An. sundaicus larvae from those of An.
   subpictus species C and D in field studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Anopheles minimus has recently been reported
   to have re-appeared in Keonjhar district of Orissa after a period of
   about 45 years of launching the malaria eradication programme. An.
   minimus and An. fluviatilis were the incriminated major malaria vectors
   in the district, endemic for falciparum malaria. The information on
   seasonal prevalence and resting behaviour of the vectors is crucial for
   implementing appropriate malaria control measures. Therefore, a study
   was undertaken on seasonal prevalence and resting behaviour of An.
   minimus and An. fluviatilis in this district.
   Methods: Seven randomly selected villages of Keonjhar district, Orissa,
   were studied during August 2005 to November 2007. Daytime resting
   collections indoors and outdoors were made covering three seasons of the
   year. The Anopheles mosquitoes obtained from different habitats were
   identified. Collections were maintained separately according to
   different sites as well as heights of the walls in human dwellings.
   Results: Among the indoor collections, the densities of An. minimus and
   An. fluviatilis were higher in human dwellings than cattle sheds. An.
   fluviatilis was the predominant (41.5\%) species followed by An. minimus
   (26.3\%) in human dwellings. The density of both the vector species in
   human dwellings peaked during rainy and winter seasons followed by
   summer. Walls were the most preferred site by these vectors for resting
   and the maximum number was collected at a height of 3 to 4 ft.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The resting behaviour of the vector
   species increases their contact with the sprayed walls and therefore, a
   quality residual spraying of human dwellings focusing indoor walls could
   interrupt the malaria transmission in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Paramilitary operations along the
   Indo-Bangladesh border are adversely affected by malaria induced
   morbidity and mortality. Villages surrounding the paramilitary
   installations often serve as disease reservoirs. Malaria incidence in
   Tripura State Rifles (TSR) units in Dhalai District of Tripura was
   studied and the role of the village population in disease transmission
   was also assessed.
   Methods: Mass blood surveys were carried out among TSR personnel and
   villagers during 2007 to 2009. Malaria diagnosis through blood smear
   examination and rapid detection kits was done, and percentage
   parasitaemia was determined. Activity of malaria vectors was monitored
   using CDC light traps.
   Results: Slide positivity rates (SPR) in the neighbouring villages
   (51.4\%) was significantly higher than that in TSR (27.7\%) (P<0.0001).
   Malaria incidence in villages did not show seasonal variability while it
   was lowest during post-monsoon season in TSR (P<0.325; OR = 0.74). Per
   cent Pf parasitaemia was high in TSR (0.29) as compared to villagers
   (0.20) (P<0.0001). Anopheles minimus and An. dirus were the major
   malaria vectors observed.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Paramilitary and public health
   authorities should adopt targeted measures to reduce the malaria
   incidence in the villages surrounding the paramilitary installations as
   the village populations play a major role in disease transmission.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to evaluate the preventive efficacy of
   insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITMNs) and mosquito repellent (MR) in
   a malaria-endemic foothill area of Assam, India, with forest ecosystem.
   During the first year, a survey was conducted in four demarcated sectors
   (A-D) to observe the malaria endemicity and vector prevalence patterns
   before implementing intervention measures. All four sectors were endemic
   for malaria. The prevalence of established malaria vectors such as
   Anopheles dims, A. minimus and A. philippinensis was observed. During
   the second year, intervention measures were implemented in the four
   sectors as follows: A, ITMN + MR; B, ITMN; C, MR; D, no intervention.
   The most effective intervention was in sector A, followed by sectors B
   and C. Sectors A and B exhibited significantly higher (P < 0.001)
   malaria protective efficacy during both the first and second years of
   intervention compared with sector D. The total vector population in the
   three intervention sectors decreased significantly compared with that of
   the non-intervention one. Information-education-communication activities
   motivated the residents to participate actively in the intervention
   programme. The finding could be an effective model for containment of
   high malaria morbidity in inaccessible forest fringe areas of the
   northeastern region of India. (C) 2011 Royal Society of Tropical

   of Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb, Andrographis lineata Wallich
   ex Nees., Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees., Cocculus
   hirsutus L. Diels, Eclipta prostrata L., and Tagetes erecta L. tested
   against malarial vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera:
   Culicidae). All plant extracts showed moderate adulticidal activity and

   for the control of A. subpictus. Therefore, this study provides first

Abstract = {{Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever and
   chikungunya in India and other South East Asian countries, and novel
   insecticides for vector control are urgently needed. In the present
   investigation, efficacy of potash alum, a traditionally known double
   salt in Indian and Chinese medicine system, was tested against the
   larvae of dengue vector, A. aegypti. LC(50,) LC(90) and LC(99) values
   were recorded for various instar larvae where I instar larvae were found
   to be the most susceptible and IV instar larvae as the least susceptible
   one. The LC(50) values of crude and standard potash alum of various
   instar larvae ranged between 15.29 and 48.53 ppm and 20.50-65.10 ppm,
   respectively. Biochemical changes were also evidenced in IV instar A.
   aegypti larvae following a sublethal exposure for 24 h in the levels of
   various nutrient reserves and primary metabolites such as sugar,
   glycogen, lipids and proteins suggesting possible mode of action
   responsible for larval mortality. Sugar and glycogen concentrations were
   measured as 24.6 and 10.67 mu g per five larvae in controls which were
   significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by 32.11-93.98\% and 39.26-94.47\%,
   respectively, in larvae treated with crude alum. In controls, protein
   and lipid content were recorded as 210.74 and 94.71 mu g per five larvae
   which dropped up to 26.53\% and 25.5\%, respectively, in larvae
   following treatment with crude alum. Moreover, drastic changes were also
   recorded for DNA content with 25.39-44.17\% decrease in crude
   alum-treated larvae. It is evident from these results that potash alum,
   a fairly cheaper and readily available ecofriendly compound could be
   recommended as a potential chemical larvicide against dengue vector at
   mosquito breeding sites in the vicinity of human dwellings.}},

Abstract = {{Glutathione S transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes involved
   in detoxification of xenobiotic compounds in majority of the insect
   groups. Significance of insect GSTs is their elevated level of activity
   in association with insecticide resistance. This investigation was to
   explore the metabolic status of GSTs in two Indian DDT-resistant malaria
   vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles annularis, and one
   DDT-susceptible vector, Anopheles fluviatilis. Malkangiri and Koraput
   districts of Orissa State, endemic for falciparum malaria and having a
   long insecticide spraying history, were the study areas. F-1 progeny was
   raised from wild-caught females of the three vectors and used for
   biochemical assays to detect the GST-mediated DDT resistance mechanism.
   Results of the enzyme assay showed a significant 3-fold increase in GST
   activity in DDT-resistant An. annularis compared with its susceptible
   population. In DDT-resistant An. culicifacies, the median GST activity
   (71.8 mu mol/min/mg) was almost the same as estimated in the
   DDT-resistant An. annularis (74.6 mu mol/min/mg), suggesting that the
   GST activity estimated in An. culicifacies could be an elevated level
   for detoxification of DDT. Furthermore, the GST activity in
   DDT-resistant An. culicifacies and An. annularis was significantly
   higher than that in the DDT-susceptible An. fluviatilis, which had a GST
   activity of 20.0 mu mol/min/mg. Also, the GST-mediated DDT
   detoxification was confirmed by comparing GST activity in wild-caught
   females with that in their F-1 progeny.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies, the main vector of human malaria in
   rural India, is a complex of five sibling species. Despite being
   phylogenetically related, a naturally selected subgroup species B of
   this sibling species complex is found to be a poor vector of malaria. We
   have attempted to understand the differences between vector and
   non-vector Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes in terms of
   transcriptionally activated nitric oxide synthase (AcNOS) physiologies
   to elucidate the mechanism of refractoriness. Identification of the
   differences between genes and gene products that may impart refractory
   phenotype can facilitate development of novel malaria transmission
   blocking strategies.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a study on phylogenetically
   related susceptible (species A) and refractory (species B) sibling
   species of An. culicifacies mosquitoes to characterize biochemical and
   molecular differences in AcNOS gene and gene elements and their ability
   to inhibit oocyst growth. We demonstrate that in species B, AcNOS
   specific activity and nitrite/nitrates in mid-guts and haemolymph were
   higher as compared to species A after invasion of the mid-gut by P.
   vivax at the beginning and during the course of blood feeding.
   Semiquantitative RT-PCR and real time PCR data of AcNOS concluded that
   this gene is more abundantly expressed in midgut of species B than in
   species A and is transcriptionally upregulated post blood meals. Dietary
   feeding of L-NAME along with blood meals significantly inhibited midgut
   AcNOS activity leading to an increase in oocyst production in An.
   culicifacies species B.
   Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that upregulation of mosquito
   innate cytotoxicity due to NOS in refractory strain to Plasmodium vivax
   infection may contribute to natural refractoriness in An. culicifacies
   mosquito population. This innate capacity of refractory mosquitoes could
   represent the ancestral function of the mosquito immune system against
   the parasite and could be utilized to understand the molecular basis of
   refractoriness in planning effective vector control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the scientific and entrepreneurial incentives for
   malaria research in the tea plantations of north Bengal in colonial
   India. In the process it highlights how the logic of `location' emerged
   as the central trope through which medical experts, as well as colonial
   administrators and planters, defined malaria research in the region. The
   paper argues that the `local' emerged as both a prerequisite of colonial
   governance as well as a significant component of malaria research in the
   field. Despite the ambiguities that such a project entailed, tropical
   medicine was enriched from a diverse understanding of local ecology,
   habitation, and structural modes of production. Nevertheless, the
   locality itself did not benefit from anti-malarial policy undertaken
   either by medical experts or the colonial state. This article suggests
   that there was a disjuncture between `tropical medicine' and its `field'
   that could not be accommodated within the colonial plantation system.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of population genetic parameters is highly dependent on the
   choice of genetic markers. Furthermore, inferences based on single genes
   could lead to erroneous conclusions and population genetic outcomes,
   thus usage of multiple loci is suggested. Considering malaria is a
   highly fatal vector-borne infectious disease, inference on population
   genetic structure and demography could be of help in the long run for
   malaria vector management and control. Using the published genome
   sequence information of Anopheles gambiae we designed EPIC primers to
   amplify DNA fragments in An. minimus nuclear genome. Eight such DNA
   fragments could be successfully amplified and sequenced and homology to
   corresponding genes of An. gambiae was established. All the eight DNA
   fragments were found to be polymorphic for single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) in a population sample of An. minimus from India.
   Several tests of neutrality confirmed that all the eight fragments
   evolve under a standard neutral model of molecular evolution.
   Furthermore, multilocus linkage disequilibrium studies revealed that the
   DNA fragments were not genetically linked to each other and thus are
   independently evolving. Tests of past population demographic events
   clearly revealed that this Indian population of An. minimus follows
   demographic equilibrium model, without any significant recent population
   bottleneck or expansion. The eight multilocus nuclear DNA fragments thus
   could be considered as `putatively neutral' and be used to infer
   population structure and demographic history of An. minimus, a major
   malaria vector in the Southeast Asia and India. Moreover, the
   estimations of population demography using these putatively neutral
   markers can provide a baseline against which, test for the role of
   natural selection in functionally relevant genes of An. minimus would be
   possible. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of irrigation canals on malaria transmission, a
   study was conducted in Dhenkanal district of Orissa, India. The district
   is situated in the central part of Orissa and hyperendemic area for
   malaria. A canal system is being constructed for irrigation in the
   district, which passes through Parjang and Analabereni Primary Health
   Centres (PHC), endemic for malaria. The water has been released only up
   to Parjang (Canal with water -CWW) area during the end of 2004 and
   construction work is still going on in Analabereni PHC (Canal under
   construction-CUC). Retrospective clinical data (2001-2008) collected
   from health services from two study sites showed average Slide
   Positivity Rate (SPR) before release of water (2001-2004) was 9.25\% and
   18.04\% in CWW and CUC areas, respectively. After release of water
   (2005-2008) the SPR was 5.77\% and 10.19\%, in CWW and CUC areas,
   respectively. The average Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was 7.66 and
   22.67 in CWW and CUC areas before the release of water and 5.32 and
   12.28 after release of water, respectively. A point fever survey was
   conducted in 2009 which revealed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum
   (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv) in both study areas. The survey found SPR of
   18.82\% and 24.54\%, and Pf percentages of 75\% and 85\%, in CWW and CUC
   areas, respectively. The present study revealed the presence of two
   malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles annularis in the
   area. Vector Per Man Hour Density was 2.38 in CWW and 2.69 in CUC for
   An. culicifacies and 1.46 and 1.54 for An. annularis respectively. The
   sporozoites rates were found to be 3.6 and 3.8 for CWW and CUC,
   respectively. The present study reveals that, the construction of canal
   system did not increase the malaria prevalence during post water release
   period implying that the malaria control programme was effective
   although still more intensive situation specific vectors control
   programme need to be continued simultaneously so that malaria
   transmission can be curtailed.}},

Abstract = {{Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) is a widely distributed
   mosquito vector species in India and also in other tropical regions of
   the world. This species is implicated in the transmission of lymphatic
   filariasis in many countries. This species is reported to be widely
   resistant to insecticides of different classes in current use. In the
   present study, bio-efficacy of chlorfenapyr, an insecticide of pyrrole
   class with a novel mode of action was tested for the control of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus. Studies were performed to determine the diagnostic
   dosage; residual efficacy on different artificially fabricated
   substrates, namely wood, mud, mud + lime, cement and cement + distemper;
   to assess cross-resistance with different insecticides; and
   synergism/antagonism using piperonyl butoxide (PBO). A dosage of 5.0\%
   chlorfenapyr was determined as diagnostic dosage with 2 h exposure and
   48 h holding period for assessing the susceptibility of mosquitoes. The
   residual efficacy was observed up to 34 weeks on wood and mud + lime
   substrates while on other substrates, it was about 15 weeks at a dosage
   of 400 mg a.i./m(2). Laboratory-reared strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus
   showed cross-resistance, whereas field-collected mosquitoes showed
   absence of cross-resistance to chlorfenapyr. Potentiation bioassays
   showed antagonistic effect of PBO to chlorfenapyr toxicity owing to the
   involvement of oxidases in the initial step of a conversion of
   pro-insecticide chlorfenapyr to toxic form CL 303268. The present study
   results have shown that chlorfenapyr can be a potential insecticide for
   the control of multiple insecticide resistant strains of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus. However, in countries where indoor residual spray
   (IRS) is not targeted for the control of this species, like in India,
   chlorfenapyr used in IRS for the control of malaria vectors in rural and
   pen-urban areas can additionally provide control of Cx. quinquefasciatus
   also. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bites of mosquitoes belonging to the genera Anopheles Meigen, Aedes
   Meigen, Culex L. and Haemagogus L. are a general nuisance and are
   responsible for the transmission of important tropical diseases such as
   malaria, hemorrhagic dengue and yellow fevers and filariasis
   (elephantiasis). Plants are traditional sources of mosquito repelling
   essential oils (EOs), glyceridic oils and repellent and synergistic
   chemicals. A Chemical Abstracts search on mosquito repellent inventions
   containing plant-derived EOs revealed 144 active patents mostly from
   Asia. Chinese, Japanese and Korean language patents and those of India
   (in English) accounted for roughly 3/4 of all patents. Since 1998
   patents on EO-containing mosquito repellent inventions have almost
   doubled about every 4 years. In general, these patents describe
   repellent compositions for use in topical agents, cosmetic products,
   incense, fumigants, indoor and outdoor sprays, fibers, textiles among
   other applications. 67 EOs and 9 glyceridic oils were individually cited
   in at least 2 patents. Over 1/2 of all patents named just one EO.
   Citronella {[}Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle, C. winterianus Jowitt ex
   Bor] and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus L'Her. spp.) EOs were each cited in
   approximately 1/3 of all patents. Camphor {[} Cinnamomum camphora (L.)
   J. Presl], cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), clove {[} Syzygium
   aromaticum (L.) Merr. \& L. M. Perry], geranium (Pelargonium graveolens
   L'Her.), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), lemon {[} Citrus x
   limon (L.) Osbeck], lemongrass {[} Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf] and
   peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) EOs were each cited in > 10\% of
   patents. Repellent chemicals present in EO compositions or added as pure
   ``natural{''} ingredients such as geraniol, limonene,
   p-menthane-3,8-diol, nepetalactone and vanillin were described in
   approximately 40\% of all patents. About 25\% of EO-containing
   inventions included or were made to be used with synthetic insect
   control agents having mosquito repellent properties such as pyrethroids,
   N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), (+/-)-p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and
   dialkyl phthalates. Synergistic effects involving one or more EOs and
   synthetic and/or natural components were claimed in about 10\% of all
   patents. Scientific literature sources provide evidence for the mosquito
   repellency of many of the EOs and individual chemical components found
   in EOs used in patented repellent inventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects, resulting from
   mutation(s) in the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene is one of
   the mechanisms of resistance against DDT and pyrethroid-group of
   insecticides. The most common mutation(s) associated with knockdown
   resistance in insects, including anophelines, has been reported to be
   present at residue Leu1014 in the IIS6 transmembrane segment of the vgsc
   gene. This study reports the presence of two alternative kdr-like
   mutations, L1014S and L1014F, at this residue in a major malaria vector
   Anopheles stephensi and describes new PCR assays for their detection.
   Methods: Part of the vgsc (IIS4-S5 linker-to-IIS6 transmembrane segment)
   of An. stephensi collected from Alwar (Rajasthan, India) was
   PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, sequenced and analysed for the presence
   of deduced amino acid substitution(s).
   Results: Analysis of DNA sequences revealed the presence of two
   alternative non-synonymous point mutations at L1014 residue in the IIS6
   transmembrane segment of vgsc, i.e., T>C mutation on the second position
   and A>T mutation on the third position of the codon, leading to Leu
   (TTA)-to-Ser (TCA) and -Phe (TTT) amino acid substitutions,
   respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed for
   identification of each of these two point mutations. Genotyping of An.
   stephensi mosquitoes from Alwar by PCR assays revealed the presence of
   both mutations, with a high frequency of L1014S. The PCR assays
   developed for detection of the kdr mutations were specific as confirmed
   by DNA sequencing of PCR-genotyped samples.
   Conclusions: Two alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014S and L1014F, were
   detected in An. stephensi with a high allelic frequency of L1014S. The
   occurrence of L1014S is being reported for the first time in An.
   stephensi. Two specific PCR assays were developed for detection of two
   kdr-like mutations in An. stephensi.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Field trials of lambda-cyhalothrin 10 CS (ICON
   10 CS) in indoor residual spraying (IRS) with 25 mg a.i./m(2) against
   Anopheles culicifacies was undertaken vs malathion IRS (25\% WP-2 g
   a.i./m2) in Tumkur district, Karnataka; vs deltamethrin IRS (2.5\% WP-20
   mg a.i./m(2)) in Dharmapuri district; and vs lambda-cyhalothrin (10
   WP-25 mg a.i./m(2)) in Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu, India.
   Methods: Spray operations in the experimental villages were done by the
   National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) and in the control
   villages by the respective State Health Department staff. Persistence of
   efficacy of insecticide sprayed in villages was assessed by contact
   bioassays against vector mosquitoes. Entomological indicators such as
   per structure density, parity rates of vector mosquitoes and sporozoite
   rates were measured in all the three study areas using standard
   procedures. Mass blood surveys and active fever case detections were
   carried out in experimental and control villages to study the impact of
   IRS on malaria transmission.
   Results: Persistence of effectiveness of ICON 10 CS was observed up to
   2-3 months in all the three study areas. ICON 10 CS was found effective
   at par with or better than the insecticides used in the national
   programme in reducing the mosquito densities and in interrupting malaria
   transmission in the study villages. Vector density, parity rates and
   malaria cases considerably reduced in the ICON 10 CS-sprayed villages.
   Conclusion: Field trials at three sites have established that ICON 10 CS
   formulation was relatively more effective than malathion 25\% WP,
   deltamethrin 2.5\% WP and lambda-cyhalothrin 10\% WP in some evaluation
   parameters like indoor resting mosquitoes, parity rates in vector
   mosquitoes and persistence of effectiveness. It can be used for IRS for
   malaria vector control with two rounds of spray at an interval of 3
   months for curtailing the malaria transmission and an additional round
   is recommended in perennial malaria transmission areas.}},

Abstract = {{India contributes greatly to the global incidence of malaria. The
   factors influencing malaria in India are highly diverse and vary greatly
   from the epidemiological setting of any other country. Central India is
   the most vulnerable area to malaria in India. This study was carried out
   in three community health centres in Dindori District, Madhya Pradesh
   (Central India). Dindori District is mesoendemic for malaria, with both
   Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax being present in all age groups.
   Anopheles culicifacies and A. fluviatilis are highly efficient vectors
   of malaria. In this study, an epidemic of malaria among indigenous
   ethnic group Baigas was investigated to determine the causes of the
   epidemic and the population involved in order to aid in disease
   containment. The existence of sporozoite-positive A. culicifacies and A.
   fluviatilis indicates either that spraying had not been done properly or
   the presence of insecticide resistance. A combination of factors
   propagated the epidemic. Evidence suggests that the non-availability of
   artemisinin-based combination therapy and rapid diagnostic tests along
   with an immunogenically vulnerable population each played an important
   role. As the global prevalence of malaria decreases owing to initiatives
   to control or eliminate the disease, more areas will become mesoendemic
   or hypoendemic for malaria. Detection and control of epidemics requires
   greater attention, and mechanisms to ensure the quality of interventions
   are essential. (C) 2010 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

   using single-labelled hybridisation probe/melting curve analysis}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation (L1014F) is a
   well-defined mechanism of resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in many
   insect species. Sensitive detection of the mutations associated with
   resistance is a prerequisite for resistance management strategies. The
   authors have developed a new real-time molecular diagnostic assay based
   on SimpleProbe (R)/melting curve analysis for large-scale kdr genotyping
   in the wild population of Culex quinquefasciatus Say, the principal
   vector of bancroftian filariasis. Melting curve analysis is based on the
   thermal stability difference between matched and mismatched DNA
   duplexes. The application of SimpleProbe (R) chemistry in insects
   described here is novel in entomology research.
   RESULTS: The mosquitoes homozygous for knockdown-resistant and
   knockdown-susceptible allele showed melting peaks at 60.45 degrees C
   (+/- 0.25) and 64.09 degrees C (+/- 0.24) respectively. The heterozygous
   mosquitoes yielded both peaks at approximately 60.5 degrees C (+/- 0.2)
   and 64.20 degrees C (+/- 0.23). Among the 92 samples genotyped, 16 were
   found to be homozygous resistant, 44 homozygous susceptible and 32
   heterozygous. Comparative assessments were made of all the reported
   methods for kdr genotyping.
   CONCLUSION: The present method is cheaper, faster, more reliable and
   versatile than other alternatives proposed in detecting correct kdr
   genotypes in mosquitoes. This is the first report using a
   single-labelled hybridisation probe to detect point mutations in insect
   populations. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Control of vector(s) or mosquitoes, in general, through biolarvicide as
   an alternate biocontrol agent is a greatest desire. We evaluated a
   water-dispersible granular formulation biolarvicide Bacillus
   thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti, H-14 serotype; VectoBac (R) WDG) in
   the laboratory and also in the field against two principal malaria
   vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi. Laboratory
   evaluations against laboratory-reared immature of the two species were
   carried out at a temperature of 28 degrees C+/-2 degrees C and 70\%-80\%
   relative humidity. Field trials were conducted in a rural area and in
   Bangalore city, Karnataka, South India. First trial against the rural
   vector An. culicifacies was carried out in stone quarry pits at dosages
   of 0.05, 0.2, and 1g/m(2). The second trial against urban vector An.
   stephensi was carried out in ring wells at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and
   1g/m(2) dosages. Laboratory tests revealed increased efficacy against
   An. stephensi. The fifty percent lethal concentration (LC(50)) and
   LC(90) values against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were 0.348 and
   1.008 mg/L (chi(2) = 8.49; p > 0.05) and 0.245 and 0.533mg/L (chi(2) =
   4.67; p < 0.05), respectively. Based on the findings of no pupal
   production in the field, the formulation was effective up to 14 days at
   0.2g/m(2) or more appropriately at 0.25g/m(2) dose for both the species
   under field conditions. We discuss how this new formulation was
   evaluated against An. culicifacies and An. stephensi under laboratory
   and field conditions. No adverse effects were observed on the nontarget
   species such as frogs, their tadpoles, small local fish, Notonectid
   bugs, and water scatters. We conclude that VectoBac WDG is effective at
   0.25 g/m(2) and be recommended for its use in the vector-borne disease
   control programunder integrated vector management concept.}},

   habitats were positively correlated with malaria occurrence. Cattle hoof
   marks (r = 0.998) and elephant footprint (turbid; r = 0.999) explained
   nearly the same amount of variance. It was observed that deforestation
   as well as elephant habitat-type destruction had engendered man-elephant
   conflicts intensively in fringe areas. Seasonal abundance pattern of
   this vector was found to vary in forest and forest fringe areas in
   relation to different habitats. Seasonal abundance of An. baimaii was
   significantly different in different habitats. The Tukey post hoc
   comparisons indicated that the abundance of An. baimaii in different
   habitats was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in monsoon season than that
   of premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. No significant difference was
   observed between premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The findings
   therefore will eventually help to predict transmission of malaria in
   targeted area and in formulating an improved malaria control program in
   the northeastern region of India.}},

Abstract = {{The study was undertaken in eight endemic districts of Orissa, India, to
   find the members of the species complexes of Anopheles culicifacies and
   Anopheles fluviatilis and their distribution patterns. The study area
   included six forested districts (Keonjhar, Angul, Dhenkanal, Ganjam,
   Nayagarh and Khurda) and two non-forested coastal districts (Puri and
   Jagatsingpur) studied over a period of two years (June 2007-May 2009).
   An. culicifacies A, B, C and D and An. fluviatilis S and T sibling
   species were reported. The prevalence of An. culicifacies A ranged from
   4.2-8.41\%, B from 54.96-76.92\%, C from 23.08-33.62\% and D from
   1.85-5.94\% (D was reported for the first time in Orissa, except for
   occurrences in the Khurda and Nayagarh districts). The anthropophilic
   indices (AI) were 3.2-4.8\%, 0.5-1.7\%, 0.71.37\% and 0.91-1.35\% for A,
   B, C and D, respectively, whereas the sporozoite rates (SR) were
   0.49-0.54\%, 0\%, 0.280.37\% and 0.41-0.46\% for A, B, C and D,
   respectively. An. fluviatilis showed a similarly varied distribution
   pattern in which S was predominant (84.3\% overall); its AI and SR
   values ranged from 60.7-90.4\% and 1.2-2.32\%, respectively. The study
   observed that the co-existence of potential vector sibling species of
   An. culicifacies (A, C and D) and An. fluviatilis S (> 50\%) was
   responsible for the high endemicity of malaria in forested districts
   such as Dhenkanal, Keonjhar, Angul, Ganjam, Nayagarh and Khurda (> 5\%
   slide positivity rate). Thus, the epidemiological scenario for malaria
   is dependent on the distribution of the vector sibling species and their
   vectorial capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Simeulue was the first landfall of the tsunami of December
   2004. The tsunami destroyed many villages on the island, leaving one
   third of the population homeless. Malaria is endemic in Simeulue and an
   epidemic was reported to have occurred three months prior to the
   tsunami. Information concerning malaria was, however, not easily
   available. The earthquakes related to the tsunami may have created
   extensive potential breeding sites of Anopheles sundaicus, the probable
   vector, and increased vulnerability of the human population; a
   possibility of increased transmission made a further outbreak possible.
   Consequently, subsequent to the tsunami, considerable amounts of aid,
   including anti-malarial measures such as insecticide treated
   mosquito-nets, were deployed on the island. A series of island-wide
   cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2005-2007 to determine whether
   these had had any effect on malaria prevalence. Larval sampling, and CDC
   light-trap and landing collections of hungry mosquitoes were also
   undertaken. The results indicate that despite the continuing presence of
   potential vectors in some places the anti-malaria measures introduced
   following the tsunami have controlled, and may be close to eliminating,
   malaria from the island. (C) 2010 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic diversity, extent and distribution of variant
   forms of Plasmodium vivax parasites is crucial in the development of
   effective control measures and in Orissa, a hyperendemic state in the
   eastern part of India, the polymorphic nature of P. vivax isolates is
   largely lacking. The result of the study analyzing two highly
   polymorphic single copy genes for P vivax circumsporozoite protein
   (pvcs) and P. vivax merozoite surface protein 3 alpha (pvmsp3 alpha)
   shows that the parasite population is highly heterogenous (33 distinct
   genotype from 35 isolates) in Orissa. However, the observation of the
   multiplicity of infection value of 1.34 and high frequency distribution
   of certain genotype with respect to individual marker (the VK247b allele
   with a frequency of 0.37; VK210e with 0.25 and VK210c with 0.14)
   suggests that the parasite population are likely to be under selective
   pressure and may either be due to preferential production of sporozoites
   carrying these variants in the available anopheline mosquito species of
   the state or selection of particular genotypes by host immune pressure.
   Moreover, although P vivax in South-East Asia indicates an overall
   predominance of VK210 which is thought to be the best adapted variant of
   pvcs repeat type, the almost equal prevalence of both repeat type of
   pvcs; VK210 and VK247 in the present study is unexpected and needs
   further study for clarification.}},

Title = {{Genetic evidence for malaria vectors of the Anopheles sundaicus complex
   in Sri Lanka with morphological characteristics attributed to Anopheles
   subpictus species B}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato, a widespread malaria vector
   in Asia, is reportedly composed of four sibling species A - D.
   Mosquitoes morphologically identified as belonging to the Subpictus
   complex were collected from different locations near the east coast of
   Sri Lanka, and specific ribosomal DNA sequences determined to validate
   their taxonomic status.
   Methods: Anopheles subpictus s.l. larvae and blood-fed adults were
   collected from different locations in the Eastern province and their
   sibling species status was determined based on published morphological
   characteristics. DNA sequences of the D3 domain of 28 S ribosomal DNA
   (rDNA) and the internal transcribed spacer -2 (ITS-2) of mosquitoes
   morphologically identified as An. subpictus sibling species A, B, C and
   D were determined.
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on D3 domain of rDNA resulted in
   two clades: one clade with mosquitoes identified as An. subpictus
   species A, C, D and some mosquitoes identified as species B, and another
   clade with a majority of mosquitoes identified as species B with D3
   sequences that were identical to Anopheles sundaicus cytotype D.
   Analysis of ITS-2 sequences confirmed a close relationship between a
   majority of mosquitoes identified as An. subpictus B with members of the
   An. sundaicus complex and others identified as An. subpictus B with An.
   subpictus s.l.
   Conclusions: The study suggests that published morphological
   characteristics are not specific enough to identify some members of the
   Subpictus complex, particularly species B. The sequences of the ITS-2
   and D3 domain of rDNA suggest that a majority that were identified
   morphologically as An. subpictus species B in the east coast of Sri
   Lanka, and some identified elsewhere in SE Asia as An. subpictus s.l.,
   are in fact members of the Sundaicus complex based on genetic similarity
   to An. sundaicus s.l. In view of the well-known ability of An. sundaicus
   s.l. to breed in brackish and fresh water and its proven ability to
   transmit malaria in coastal areas of many Southeast Asian countries, the
   present findings have significant implications for malaria control in
   Sri Lanka and neighbouring countries.}},

   different months of intervention after 3 min of exposure and 100\%
   mortality was recorded after 24 h of recovery period. The median
   knockdown time for these species ranged between 4.10-5.25 min and
   4.00-5.00 min respectively during intervention period. In Interceptor
   net study area, there was a significant reduction of 88.9, 96.3 and
   90.6\% in the entry rate of An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and other
   anopheline species respectively with an over all reduction of 87.5\% in
   total mosquitoes. The overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the
   trial villages was only 12.8\% in comparison to 35.0 and 78.8\% in
   villages with untreated nets and no nets respectively. A significant
   reduction was also recorded in parity rate and human blood index of
   vector species in Interceptor net area. The results of the study showed
   that Interceptor nets are effective against the malaria vectors and may
   be used as a suitable intervention strategy in high-risk areas. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Culex quinquefasciatus is a major vector of filariasis and various
   encephalitis in India and worldwide. Vector control remains the most
   successful strategy for the suppression of mosquito borne diseases. The
   genetic structure of vector populations in terms of insecticide
   resistance and susceptibility or refractoriness to infection may
   possibly vary. To exploit the genetic variability in vector population
   could pave the path for the alternative strategies in vector management.
   The sequences of ribosomal RNA molecules have been widely used for such
   studies. Here, we examined the molecular phylogenetic relationship among
   the Cx. quinquefasciatus collected from different geographical regions
   of India, using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene nucleotide sequences.
   The distances among the species were measured using Pearson correlation;
   the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used for the clustering with
   appropriate bootstrap values using Data Analysis in Molecular Biology
   and Evolution (DAMBE) software. The results revealed that the
   populations are genetically diverse. Based on the distance values and
   the tree topology on the basis of 165 rRNA sequences reflected the clear
   biogeographical and geoclimatic pattern among the different geographical
   populations from India. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Any biological study is only meaningful if the concerned organism is
   accurately identified; this is particularly important in vector-borne
   disease studies where correct and precise identification of the target
   species has medical and practical implications, such as in vector
   control. The Myzomyia series is divided into four groups including the
   Funestus group, which consists of five subgroups, i.e. Aconitus,
   Culicifacies, Funestus, Minimus, Rivulorum, and the Neocellia series,
   which is divided into three groups Annularis, Jamesii and Maculatus.
   Members of the Funestus group of Myzomyia and the Annularis group of the
   Neocellia series are difficult to identify because of themorphological
   overlap that exists within the groups. Therefore a multiplex polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed based on the sequence of the D3
   region of 28S rDNA to distinguish between four members (An. fluviatilis,
   An. culicifacies, An. varuna and An. aconitus) of three subgroups
   (Minimus, Aconitus, Culicifacies) of the Funestus group of Myzomyia and
   three members (An. annularis, An. pallidus and An. philippinensis) of
   the Annularis group of the Neocellia series of the Anopheles subgenus
   Cellia, prevalent in Orissa, India. Polymorphism present on the D3
   region of rDNA allowed the development of a species-specific primer that
   when combined with two universal primers lead to a simple and sensitive
   multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) assay. This
   assay can be applied as an unbiased confirmatory method for the
   identification of morphological variants, imperfectly preserved
   specimens and life stages for which taxonomic keys do not allow a
   definitive species determination. Finally, phylogenetic relationships
   between the members of the two series were determined using D3 sequence
   data. The phylogenetic relationships inferred from maximum parsimony and
   the neighbour joining analysis separated two distinct monophyletic
   clades, one consisting of species of Myzomyia and other of species of
   the Neocellia series. The molecular phylogeny obtained in this work
   matches with that of the classical morphological taxonomy reasonably
   well, with proper species arrangements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Persistent transmission of malaria in Garo hills of Meghalaya bordering
   Bangladesh, north-east India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is endemic in Garo hills of Meghalaya, and death
   cases are reported annually. Plasmodium falciparum is the major
   parasite, and is solely responsible for each malaria-attributable death
   case. Garo hills are categorized high-risk for drug-resistant malaria;
   however, there exists no data on malaria transmitting mosquitoes
   prevalent in the region. Included in this report are entomological
   observations with particular reference to vector biology characteristics
   for devising situation specific intervention strategies for disease
   transmission reduction.
   Methods: The epidemiological data of the West Garo hills have been
   reviewed retrospectively for 2001-2009 to ascertain the disease
   transmission profile given the existing interventions. Point prevalence
   study was conducted in Dalu Community Health Centre that lies in close
   proximity to international border with Bangladesh to ascertain the true
   prevalence of malaria, and parasite species. Mosquito collections were
   made in human dwellings of malaria endemic villages aiming at vector
   incrimination, and to study relative abundance, resting and feeding
   preferences, and their present susceptibility status to DDT.
   Results: Investigations revealed that the West Garo hill district is
   co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, but P.
   falciparum was the predominant infection (> 82\%). Malaria transmission
   was perennial and persistent with seasonal peak during May-July
   corresponding to months of high rainfall. Entomological collections
   revealed that Anopheles minimus was the predominant species that was
   incriminated by detection of sporozoites in salivary glands (infection
   rate 2.27\%), and was ascertained to be fully susceptible to DDT.
   Conclusion: For the control of malaria, improved diagnosis and sustained
   supply of drugs for artemisinin-based combination therapy are strongly
   advocated, which should be enforced for treatment of every single case
   of P. falciparum. Greater political commitment is called for organized
   vector control operations along border/high-risk areas to contain the
   spread of drug-resistant malaria, and averting impending disease
   outbreaks.}},

Title = {{Persistence of DDT, malathion \& deltamethrin resistance in Anopheles
   culicifacies after their sequential withdrawal from indoor residual

Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{132}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Under the national antimalaria programme DDT
   was introduced in early 1950s for vector control and later hexachloro
   cyclohexane (HCH) followed by malathion and recently synthetic
   pyrethroids in 1990s to manage the insecticide resistance in Anopheles
   culicifacies. Subsequent replacement led to development of multiple
   resistances in An. culcifacies in Surat district in Gujarat State.
   Indoor residual spray (IRS) was completely withdrawn in southern
   villages in Surat in 2002. This study was undertaken in these areas to
   study the persistence of resistance to DDT, malathion and deltamethrin
   after sequential withdrawal of IRS with these insecticides at different
   times.
   Methods: Susceptibility tests on An. culicifacies were conducted using
   standard WHO methods and kits. Mortality, knockdown time and lethal
   times were calculated for An. culicifacies exposed to WHO prescribed
   diagnostic concentrations of different insecticide impregnated papers.
   Results: Persistence of DDT-resistance was observed even after 30 yr of
   its withdrawal from IRS. Similarly, persistence of malathion resistance
   was also observed after 9 yr of its withdrawal from IRS, while reversal
   of deltamethrin-resistance was observed very fast within 2-3 yr after
   its withdrawal from IRS in 2002.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Present data indicate that the quantum of
   reversion of insecticide resistance in a population is relative and
   depends on the genetic stability of the respective resistance genes in
   the mosquitoes. In the present study withdrawal of pyrethroid-IRS
   resulted in increased susceptibility against pyrethroids alone and was
   independent of existence of resistance to insecticides of other groups.
   This study emphasizes that appropriate rotation of different
   insecticides; including carbamates may prevent or delay the onset of
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Entomological surveys were conducted for three consecutive years in core
   and buffer zone of the Dibru-Saikhowa biosphere reserve in pre monsoon,
   monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A total of 52 species of mosquitoes
   under eleven genera have been detected. The genus Anopheles (18 species)
   was the predominant followed by Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Armigeres,
   Mimomyia, Ochlerostatus, Malaya, Toxorhynchites, Ficalbia and Aedeomyia.
   The buffer zone of the forest reserve where human habitations are there
   exhibited the presence of maximum number of species (49 species under 10
   genera) in comparison to core zone (42 species under 10 genera). In
   buffer zone, maximum numbers of species (38) were recorded in monsoon
   season followed by post- monsoon (35 species) and Pre-monsoon season (34
   species). Whereas in core zone, maximum number of species were collected
   in post monsoon season followed by pre monsoon season and monsoon
   season. In Core and buffer zone, the maximum species were recorded from
   the ground pool habitat and slow flowing stream respectively Among the
   disease vectors, the potential Japanese encephalitis vectors
   incriminated in India were very much prevalent. This study provides the
   list of available mosquito species recorded for the first time in the
   Dibru-Saikhowa biosphere reserve.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the known
   malaria vectors in south and southeastern Iran. Earlier ITS2 sequences
   analysis of specimens from Iran demonstrated only a single genotype that
   was identical to species Y in India, which is also the same as species
   T. We identified 2 haplotypes in the An. fluviatilis populations of Iran
   based on differences in nucleotide sequences of D3 domain of the 28S
   locus of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Comparison of sequence data from 44
   Iranian specimens with those publicly available in the Genbank database
   showed that all of the 28S-D3 sequences from Kazeroun and Khesht regions
   in Fars Province were identical to the database entry representing
   species U in India. In other regions, all the individuals showed
   heterozygosity at the single nucleotide position, which identifies
   species U and T. It is argued that the 2 species may co-occur in some
   regions and hybridize; however, the heterozygosity in the 28S-D3 locus
   was not reflected in ITS2 sequences and this locus for all individuals
   was identical to species T. This study shows that in a newly diverged
   species, like members of An. fluviatilis complex, a single molecular
   marker may not be sufficiently discriminatory to identify all the taxa
   over a vast geographical area. In addition, other molecular markers may
   provide more reliable information for species discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the larvicidal and adult emergence inhibition
   activities of castor (Ricinus communis) seed extract against three
   potential mosquito vectors Anopheles stephensi (An. stephensi), Culex
   quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus) and Aedes albopictus (Ae.
   albopictus) in India. Methods: The R. communis seed extract was tested,
   employing WHO procedure, against fourth larval instars of the three
   mosquito species for 24 h and larval Mortalities were recorded at
   various concentrations (2-64 mu g/mL); the 24 h LC50 values of the R.
   cowman's seed extract were determined following Probit analysis. The
   larval killing, antipupation and adult emergence inhibition rates of the
   test extract, using a single concentration of 2 mu LC50, were studied at
   different time periods (24-72 h); the extract toxicity was tested
   against a fish, Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus). Results: The R.
   communis seed extract exhibited larvicidal effects with 100 \% killing
   activities at concentrations 32-64 mu g/mL, and with LC50 values 7.10,
   11.64 and 16.84 mu g/mL for Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi and Ae.
   albopictus larvae, respectively. When the larvae were treated with the
   extract at a single concentration of 2 X LC50, significant differences
   were observed, compared to control groups, in rate of pupation (P<0.001)
   as well as in adult formation (P<0.001). Conclusions: The present
   findings suggest that the R. communis seed extract provided an excellent
   potential for controlling An. stephensi, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae.
   albopictus mosquito vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Inferences on the taxonomic positions, phylogenetic interrelationships
   and divergence time among closely related species of medical importance
   is essential to understand evolutionary patterns among species, and
   based on which, disease control measures could be devised. To this
   respect, malaria is one of the important mosquito borne diseases of
   tropical and sub-tropical parts of the globe. Taxonomic status of
   malaria vectors has been so far documented based on morphological,
   cytological and few molecular genetic features. However, utilization of
   multilocus DNA sequences in phylogenetic inferences are still in dearth.
   India contains one of the richest resources of mosquito species
   diversity but little molecular taxonomic information is available in
   Indian malaria vectors. We herewith utilized the whole genome sequence
   information of An. gambiae to amplify and sequence three orthologous
   nuclear genetic regions in six Indian malaria vector species (An.
   culicifacies, An. minimus, An. sundaicus, An. fluviatilis, An. annularis
   and An. stephensi). Further, we utilized the previously published DNA
   sequence information on the COII and ITS2 genes in all the six species,
   making the total number of loci to five. Multilocus molecular
   phylogenetic study of Indian anophelines and An. gambiae was conducted
   at each individual genetic region using Neighbour Joining (NJ), Maximum
   Likelihood (ML), Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian approaches.
   Although tree topologies with COII, and ITS2 genes were similar, for no
   other three genetic regions similar tree topologies were observed. In
   general, the reconstructed phylogenetic status of Indian malaria vectors
   follows the pattern based on morphological and cytological
   classifications that was reconfirmed with COII and ITS2 genetic regions.
   Further, divergence times based on COII gene sequences were estimated
   among the seven Anopheles species which corroborate the earlier
   hypothesis on the radiation of different species of the Anopheles genus
   during the late Cretaceous period. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In recent times, there were considerable efforts made to promote the use
   of environmentally friendly and biodegradable natural insecticides and
   repellents, particularly from botanical sources. The present study
   explored the effects of crude leaf ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol
   extracts of Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa ex Roxb, Andrographis lineata
   Wallich ex Nees., Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wallich ex Nees.,
   Cocculus hirsutus (L.) Diels, Eclipta prostrata L., and Tagetes erecta
   L. on repellent activity against Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles. The
   maximum repellent activity was observed at 500 ppm in methanol extracts
   of A. marmelos, ethyl acetate extracts of A. lineata, C. hirsutus, and
   E. prostrata and the mean complete protection time ranged from 120 to
   150 min with the different extracts tested. The ethyl acetate extract of
   A. lineata showed 100\% repellency in 120 min; acetone extracts of A.
   marmelos and C. hirsutus and methanol extract of T. erecta showed
   complete protection in 90 min at 250 ppm, respectively. These results
   suggest that the leaf extracts of A. marmelos, A. lineata, and C.
   hirsutus have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach
   for the control of the C. tritaeniorhynchus. Therefore, this study
   provides first report on the repellent activity against Japanese
   encephalitis, C. tritaeniorhynchus of plant extracts from Southern
   India.}},

Abstract = {{Chikungunya (CHIK) is an emerging or reemerging arboviral infectious
   disease transmitted to humans by the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes
   albopictus (Skuse), and the yellow fever mosquito, Ac. aegypti (L.),
   particularly in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and other parts of Europe
   where numerous outbreaks and epidemics were documented during recent
   decades. This viral disease is a potential threat to human health
   worldwide; thus, a quantitative one-step, real-time RT-PCR protocol was
   developed and assessed as a suitable assay for minimum detection of
   chikungunya virus (CHIKV) E1 (genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae) in
   human serum (7.51 fg/mu l) by using the QuantiTect (R) Probe RT-PCR kit
   with appropriate synthetic primer (CHIK E1 F and CHIK E1 R) and
   dual-labeled CHIK El probe. Unfortunately, we did not detect any CHIKV
   from 9 species, namely Ac. albopictus, Aedes (=Ochlerotatus) cantans
   (Meigen), Ae. cinereus Meigen, Ae. geminus Peus, Ae. vexans (Meigen),
   Anopheles claviger Meigen, An. maculipennis Meigen s.l., An. plumbeus
   Stephens, and Culex pipiens L., but some Kamiti River virus (KRV) were
   found in Ae. albopictus eggs, Ae. cinereus and Ae. vexans mosquitoes
   adults. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these novel insect
   flaviviruses from Ac. albopictus eggs is closely related to Cell fusing
   agent virus (CFAV), which is different from the other group of
   arbo-viruses from extra Aedes spp. mosquitoes. These results suggest
   that Aedes spp. in the area of Ticino, Switzerland are likely to be
   highly infected with two distinct groups of insect flaviviruses,
   excluding the possibility of CHIKV in mosquito vectors.}},

Title = {{Reduced susceptibility to selected synthetic pyrethroids in urban
   malaria vector Anopheles stephensi: a case study in Mangalore city,
   South India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Synthetic pyrethroids are potent insecticides most commonly
   used in the vector control programme. These are applied for indoor
   residual sprays, space sprays and in impregnated bed nets. Resistance
   reduces the efficacy of insecticides. Thus, the susceptibility status of
   the target vector(s) is monitored routinely to select the effective
   ones. A study was undertaken in a malaria endemic coastal city
   Mangalore, Karnataka, South India, against the known malaria vector
   Anopheles stephensi.
   Methods: The susceptibility status was assessed at diagnostic doses of
   DDT (4\%), malathion (5\%), deltamethrin (0.05\%), cyfluthrin (0.15\%),
   alphacypermethrin (0.10\%), lambdacyhalothrin (0.05\%) and permethrin
   (0.75\%) using the standard WHO tube test method during October/November
   2006.
   Results: Anopheles stephensi was resistant to malathion by 54.9\%, but
   tolerant to deltamethrin by 86.1\%, cyfluthrin 95.5\% and
   alphacypermethrin 90.6\%, whereas it was susceptible to DDT by 98.1\%,
   lambdacyhalothrin 98.6\% and permethrin 100.0\%, respectively. The
   KDT(50) and KDT(95) values for these insecticides also showed the
   similar responses.
   Conclusion: Susceptibility of An. stephensi to DDT is an important
   finding as this has never been used in Mangalore city, whereas its rural
   counterpart Anopheles culicifacies is widely resistant to this
   insecticide. The study explores the selection and rotation of the
   appropriate insecticide molecule even within the same group for
   effective vector management.}},

Abstract = {{The Anopheles philippinensis and An. nivipes mosquitoes that form part
   of the An. annularis species group are morphologically very similar and
   difficult to differentiate as adults. In consequence, researchers
   generally refer to all field-collected individuals of these species
   simply as the An. philippinensis-nivipes species complex. Although this
   species complex is understood to play a role in the transmission of
   parasites causing human malaria in northeastern India, the identity of
   the exact species involved, and the relative importance of the local An.
   philippinensis and An. nivipes, are far from clear. To settle this
   issue, house-frequenting female adults of the An. philippinensis-nivipes
   species complex were collected from 23 localities in the six
   north-eastern states, identified to species (using an allele-specific
   PCR to explore the insects' ribosomal-DNA internal-transcribed-spacer-2
   sequences) and checked for Plasmodium DNA (using a nested PCR based on
   the 18S subunit of the parasite's ribosomal DNA). Of the 337 females of
   the An. philippinensis-nivipes species complex that were investigated,
   275 were identified as An. nivipes and 62 as An. philippinensis.
   Malarial infection was detected in the heads/thoraces of just two
   specimens, with P. falciparum DNA detected in one An. nivipes from
   Nagaland state and one An. nivipes from Assam state. These results
   provide unambiguous evidence of the presence of both An. philippinensis
   and An. nivipes in the northeastern region of India and the involvement
   of An. nivipes in transmitting P. falciparum in this area.}},

Title = {{Presence of two alternative kdr-like mutations, L1014F and L1014S, and a
   novel mutation, V1010L, in the voltage gated Na+ channel of Anopheles
   culicifacies from Orissa, India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Background: Knockdown resistance in insects resulting from mutation(s)
   in the voltage gated Na+ channel (VGSC) is one of the mechanisms of
   resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Recently a point mutation
   leading to Leu-to-Phe substitution in the VGSC at residue 1014, a most
   common kdr mutation in insects, was reported in Anopheles culicifacies-a
   major malaria vector in the Indian subcontinent. This study reports the
   presence of two additional amino acid substitutions in the VGSC of an
   An. culicifacies population from Malkangiri district of Orissa, India.
   Methods: Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato (s.l.) samples, collected
   from a population of Malkangiri district of Orissa (India), were
   sequenced for part of the second transmembrane segment of VGSC and
   analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations. A new primer
   introduced restriction analysis-PCR (PIRA-PCR) was developed for the
   detection of the new mutation L1014S. The An. culicifacies population
   was genotyped for the presence of L1014F substitution by an
   amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and for L1014S
   substitutions by using a new PIRA-PCR developed in this study. The
   results were validated through DNA sequencing.
   Results: DNA sequencing of An. culicifacies individuals collected from
   district Malkangiri revealed the presence of three amino acid
   substitutions in the IIS6 transmembrane segments of VGSC, each one
   resulting from a single point mutation. Two alternative point mutations,
   3042A>T transversion or 3041T>C transition, were found at residue L1014
   leading to Leu (TTA)-to-Phe (TTT) or -Ser (TCA) changes, respectively. A
   third and novel substitution, Val (GTG)-to-Leu (TTG or CTG), was
   identified at residue V1010 resulting from either of the two
   transversions-3028G>T or 3028G>C. The L1014S substitution co-existed
   with V1010L in all the samples analyzed irrespective of the type of
   point mutation associated with the latter. The PIRA-PCR strategy
   developed for the identification of the new mutation L1014S was found
   specific as evident from DNA sequencing results of respective samples.
   Since L1014S was found tightly linked to V1010L, no separate assay was
   developed for the latter mutation. Screening of population using
   PIRA-PCR assays for 1014S and ARMS for 1014F alleles revealed the
   presence of all the three amino acid substitutions in low frequency.
   Conclusions: This is the first report of the presence of L1014S
   (homologous to the kdr-e in An. gambiae) and a novel mutation V1010L
   (resulting from G-to-T or -C transversions) in the VGSC of An.
   culicifacies in addition to the previously described mutation L1014F.
   The V1010L substitution was tightly linked to L1014S substitution. A new
   PIRA-PCR strategy was developed for the detection of L1014S mutation and
   the linked V1010L mutation.}},

Abstract = {{A longitudinal entomological survey was conducted to provide in-depth
   information on An. epiroticus and determine whether ecological and
   entomological factors could influence malaria transmission in Rayong
   Province, Thailand. The mosquitoes were collected monthly from May 2007
   to April 2008 by human landing catch technique from 6:00-12:00 PM for 2
   consecutive nights, at 3 collection sites. A total of 3,048 mosquitoes
   within 5 species were captured: An. epiroticus, Culex quinquefasciatus
   Say, Cx. sitiens Wiedemann, Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus Skuse.
   PCR was used for molecular identification of An. sundaicus complex, by
   determination of COI, ITS2, and D3 genes. The target mosquitoes were An.
   epiroticus, which was the predominant species, accounting for 43.8\% of
   specimens collected. The biting cycle pattern increased during 6:00-8:00
   PM and reached a maximum of 6.6 bites/person/hour by 12:00 Pm. The
   mosquitoes varied in population density throughout the year. The highest
   biting rate was 37.6 bites/person/half night in September and the lowest
   (10.2 bites/person/half night) in January. Nested PCR and real-time PCR
   techniques were used to detect the malaria parasite in An. epiroticus
   adult females. Nine of 926 (0.97\%) mosquitoes tested were malaria
   parasite positive: 6 P. falciparum and 3 P. vivax. The infective
   mosquitoes were found in the dry and early rainy seasons. The overall
   annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in the village was 76.6. The
   overall parity rate was 74\%. A total of 38 cement tanks were used to
   characterize the nature of the breeding places of An. epiroticus. An.
   epiroticus larvae coexisted with Aedes and Culex larvae; the maximum
   larval density was more than 140 larvae per dip in May. Breeding places
   included fresh, brackish and salt water, typically with full sunlight
   and mats of green algae on the water surface. The salinity of the water
   ranged from 0.5 to 119.4 g/l, with a narrow pH range of 8.2-8.7.
   Dissolved oxygen was highest in November (6.27 mg/l) and lowest in March
   (3.46 mg/l). The water temperature varied between 24.6 and 32.8 degrees
   C.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The long-lasting insecticidal nets are ready-to-use,
   pretreated nets, which do not require retreatment for 4-5 years. Olyset
   (TM) nets that are made of high-density polyethylene monofilament yarn
   with 2\% w/w permethrin incorporated (corresponding to 1g/m(2)) are
   type-2 in which insecticide is incorporated into the polymers and are
   wash resistant. In these, insecticide migrates to the surface of the
   netting fiber to be bioavailable against mosquitoes and other insect
   pests.
   Study Site and Objectives: The present study was a village scale,
   field-based trial that was conducted in Plasmodium falciparum
   predominant area of Assam to assess feasibility, acceptability, and
   sustainability of this intervention against vector populations and
   disease transmission. We here report the research findings of Olyset net
   as an intervention against Anopheles minimus-transmitted malaria in
   foothill area of Assam for the first year of observations beginning July
   2005 till June 2006.
   Results: An. minimus, the mosquito vector species, was observed to be
   fully susceptible to permethrin. Follow-up investigations revealed that
   An. minimus mosquitoes had virtually disappeared in Olyset net villages,
   which was corroborated by data on human bait mosquito-landing catches.
   There was a consistent decline in the malarial incidence in Olyset net
   intervention villages, and the overall impact on the malarial
   transmission was significant compared to untreated net and no-net
   control villages for the corresponding study period. The bioavailability
   of insecticide on Olyset netting fiber was consistent (100\% kill
   effect) up to 10 months of monitoring, and was observed to be wash
   resistant even after the 20th wash at fortnightly intervals.
   Conclusions: The Olyset nets were safe to use, wash resistant, and
   assessed to be operationally feasible, community-based intervention for
   sustainable management of disease vectors against malaria. Community
   compliance and acceptance was high, and users reported decreased
   nuisance due to biting mosquitoes.}},

Title = {{Anopheles culicifacies breeding in brackish waters in Sri Lanka and
   implications for malaria control}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies is the major vector of both
   falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri Lanka, while Anopheles subpictus and
   certain other species function as secondary vectors. In Sri Lanka, An.
   culicifacies is present as a species complex consisting of species B and
   E, while An. subpictus exists as a complex of species A-D. The
   freshwater breeding habit of An. culicifacies is well established. In
   order to further characterize the breeding sites of the major malaria
   vectors in Sri Lanka, a limited larval survey was carried out at a site
   in the Eastern province that was affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami.
   Methods: Anopheline larvae were collected fortnightly for six months
   from a brackish water body near Batticaloa town using dippers. Collected
   larvae were reared in the laboratory and the emerged adults were
   identified using standard keys. Sibling species status was established
   based on Y-chromosome morphology for An. culicifacies larvae and
   morphometric characteristics for An. subpictus larvae and adults.
   Salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were determined at the larval
   collection site.
   Results: During a six month study covering dry and wet seasons, a total
   of 935 anopheline larvae were collected from this site that had salinity
   levels up to 4 parts per thousand at different times. Among the emerged
   adult mosquitoes, 661 were identified as An. culicifacies s.l. and 58 as
   An. subpictus s.l. Metaphase karyotyping of male larvae showed the
   presence of species E of the Culicifacies complex, and adult
   morphometric analysis the presence of species B of the Subpictus
   complex. Both species were able to breed in water with salinity levels
   up to 4 ppt.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates the ability of An. culicifacies
   species E, the major vector of falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri
   Lanka, to oviposit and breed in brackish water. The sibling species B in
   the An. subpictus complex, a well-known salt water breeder and a
   secondary malaria vector in the country, was also detected at the same
   site. Since global warming and the rise in sea levels will further
   increase of inland brackish water bodies, the findings have significant
   implications for the control of malaria in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{The identity and distribution of the prevalent member species of the
   Anopheles dirus complex mosquitoes in the north-eastern region of India
   was investigated in a cross-sectional study. We altogether collected 267
   individuals of An. dirus s.l. from 27 forested/forest fringed locations
   spread across the seven northeastern states, identified the species
   using a ribosomal DNA (r-DNA) second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)
   based allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) method and
   sequenced the ITS2 locus in a sub set of mosquitoes. An. baimaii was
   identified as the main, almost exclusive (266/267), species of the Dirus
   complex throughout the north-east India with no intraspecific variation
   in the 479 base pair long ITS2 sequences in 59 of the 60 individuals
   sequenced. Ribosomal DNA of one individual from Assam state did not
   amplify in the ASPCR, possessed 786 base pair long ITS2 sequence and
   showed 99.7\% similarity with the sequence of An. dims species D (An.
   baimaii) from Yunnan province of China, later referred to as species X
   of the Dirus complex. These observations suggest the presence of
   another, possibly the new, species of the Dirus complex, sympatric with
   An. baimaii, in Assam warranting investigations on its distribution,
   biology and role in human malaria transmission in north-east India. (C)

   common interspersed repeats in the form of dimers, trimers, tetramers,
   pentamers and polymers. The TG repeat motif, which was repeated 50 to 60
   times, was common in Indian and Srilankan populations of An. subpictus.
   Further, there were as many as seven different types of polymers/repeats

Abstract = {{Malaria is endemic in Assam, northeast India, with low-to-moderate
   transmission of the causative parasites, mostly by Anopheles minimus.
   Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant parasite (>60\%), with
   remaining cases being due to P. vivax. As an alternative intervention
   for malaria control, long-lasting insecticidal nets {[}Interceptor
   coated with alpha-cypermethrin 10\% suspension concentrate (SC), 0.667\%
   w/w, 0.2 g/m(2)] underwent field evaluation for laboratory wash
   resistance and residual efficacy in field conditions against
   malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Based on entomological observations,
   the Interceptor net intervention was the most effective, corresponding
   to the lowest mosquito vector density in experimental villages. There
   was virtual disappearance of A. minims in Interceptor net villages in
   contrast to the untreated net intervention and the no-net control.
   Contact cone bioassay tests revealed 100\% mortality in the A. minimus
   group of mosquito species in the community using the Interceptor net,
   which was consistent during the follow-up monitoring period (October
   2006 to April 2007) in field conditions. Similar levels of mortality
   were observed in laboratory-washed nets compared with unwashed nets, and
   wash resistance was consistent even after the 20th serial wash at
   fortnightly intervals. Community compliance and acceptance of the
   Interceptor net was high, with decreased nuisance due to biting
   mosquitoes and other household insect pests being reported. (C) 2009

Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Large-scale intervention programmes to control or eliminate
   several infectious diseases are currently underway worldwide. However, a
   major unresolved question remains: what are reasonable stopping points
   for these programmes? Recent theoretical work has highlighted how the
   ecological complexity and heterogeneity inherent in the transmission
   dynamics of macroparasites can result in elimination thresholds that
   vary between local communities. Here, we examine the empirical evidence
   for this hypothesis and its implications for the global elimination of
   the major macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, by applying a
   novel Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit a dynamic model of
   the transmission of this parasitic disease to field data from nine
   villages with different ecological and geographical characteristics.
   Baseline lymphatic filariasis microfilarial age-prevalence data from
   three geographically distinct endemic regions, across which the major
   vector populations implicated in parasite transmission also differed,
   were used to fit and calibrate the relevant vector-specific filariasis
   transmission models. Ensembles of parasite elimination thresholds,
   generated using the Bayesian fitting procedure, were then examined in
   order to evaluate site-specific heterogeneity in the values of these
   thresholds and investigate the ecological factors that may underlie such
   variability
   Results: We show that parameters of density-dependent functions relating
   to immunity, parasite establishment, as well as parasite aggregation,
   varied significantly between the nine different settings, contributing
   to locally varying filarial elimination thresholds. Parasite elimination
   thresholds predicted for the settings in which the mosquito vector is
   anopheline were, however, found to be higher than those in which the
   mosquito is culicine, substantiating our previous theoretical findings.
   The results also indicate that the probability that the parasite will be
   eliminated following six rounds of Mass Drug Administration with
   diethylcarbamazine and albendazole decreases markedly but non-linearly
   as the annual biting rate and parasite reproduction number increases.
   Conclusions: This paper shows that specific ecological conditions in a
   community can lead to significant local differences in population
   dynamics and, consequently, elimination threshold estimates for
   lymphatic filariasis. These findings, and the difficulty of measuring
   the key local parameters (infection aggregation and acquired immunity)
   governing differences in transmission thresholds between communities,
   mean that it is necessary for us to rethink the utility of the current
   anticipatory approaches for achieving the elimination of filariasis both
   locally and globally.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles minimus s.l. and Anopheles fluviatilis s.l., two closely
   related taxa, are reported vectors of malaria in Assam state of India.
   We determined the DNA sequences of morphologically identified A. minimus
   s.l. and A. fluviatilis s.l. collected from the Kamrup district in
   Assam, for two rDNA loci-internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D3
   domain of 28S rDNA (28S-D3). Analysis of rDNA data revealed that the
   sequences of both the morphologically identified A. minimus s.l. and A.
   fluviatilis s.l. from Assam are identical, homologous to the sequences
   of A. minimus s.s. (former species A) and different from that of all the
   reported members of the Fluviatilis Complex (species S, T and U). This
   indicates that A. fluviatilis s.l. being reported in Kamrup district,
   Assam, in low density, mostly during January to April, is actually a
   hypermelanic and seasonal variant of A. minimus. It was also found that
   the banding pattern on chromosome arm 2 (which bears species-diagnostic
   inversions for the Fluviatilis Complex) of A. minimus and of A.
   fluviatilis s.l. from Assam is homosequential with A. fluviatilis
   species U suggesting that probably previously described A. fluviatilis U
   from Assam were also A. minimus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A repertoire of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was generated against the

   AC-29 significantly inhibited Plasmodium vivax development inside the
   mosquito midgut. The number of oocysts that developed was reduced by
   78.6\% when mosquitoes ingested a combination of these two mAbs along
   with the blood meal. AC-43 mAb binds to the epitope common in 97, 80 and
   43 kDa polypeptides from the midgut protein extract, as indicated by
   western blot analysis. Similarly, the mAb AC-29 recognized 52, 44, 40
   and 29 kDa polypeptides. These female midgut-specific polypeptides are
   shared between An. culicifacies and An. stephensi, two major vectors of

   AC-43 and AC-29. Gold particle labelling revealed that both these mAbs
   preferentially bind to glycoproteins at the apical microvilli and the
   microvillus-associated network present inside transverse sections of the
   gut epithelium. These regions are particularly known to have receptors
   for ookinetes, which enable them to cross this epithelial barrier and
   provide them with certain necessary chemicals or components for further

   potential candidates for a vector-directed transmission-blocking vaccine

Title = {{Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria}},
Journal = {{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector
   control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and
   insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced
   malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health
   effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important,
   and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions.
   Objectives
   To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts
   of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register
   (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE
   (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982
   to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and
   conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field,
   organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007).
   Selection criteria
   Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after
   studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no
   IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not
   representative of the general population, or using insecticides and
   dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were
   excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors
   extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where
   possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies
   were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with
   ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity.
   Main results
   IRS versus no IRS
   Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in
   Tanzania IRS reduced re-infection with malaria parasites detected by
   active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy
   (PE) 54\%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by
   passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five
   years; PE 14\%, but not in children older than five years (PE-2\%). In
   the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not
   significant (PE 6\%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference
   0.85 g/dL).
   In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria
   prevalence during the wet season (PE 26\%; 95\% CI 20 to 32\%) but not
   in the dry season (PE 6\%; 95\% CI -4 to 15\%). In one ITS in
   Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7
   years (from 60 to 65\% prevalence to 4 to 8\% prevalence; the weighted
   PE before-after was 74\% (95\% CI 72 to 76\%).
   Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate
   of all malaria infections; PE 31\% in India, and 88\% (95\% CI 69 to
   96\%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of
   P. falciparum (PE 93\%, 95\% CI 61 to 98\% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE
   79\%, 95\% CI 45 to 90\% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on
   malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76\% in Pakistan; PE 28\% in
   India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum
   there was a PE of 92\% in Pakistan and 34\% in India; for P. vivax there
   was a PE of 68\% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of
   -2\%).
   IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs)
   Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable
   transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological reinfection
   by active surveillance after treatment in short-term cohorts, ITNs
   appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the
   unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS: ITN = 1.22). When the
   incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no
   difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio =
   0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria
   prevalence or haemoglobin.
   Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence,
   the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group
   in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk
   ratio IRS: ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the
   cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs
   appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS
   in India (risk ratio IRS: ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum
   (risk ratio IRS: ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS: ITN = 1.37).
   Authors' conclusions
   Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the
   impact of IRS. However, the number of high-quality trials are too few to
   quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The
   evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that
   IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but
   randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some
   limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in
   unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of
   ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects.}},

Abstract = {{An outbreak of malaria in Naxalbari, West Bengal, India, in 2005 was
   investigated to understand determinants and propose control measures.
   Malaria cases were slide-confirmed. Methods included calculation of
   annual blood examination rates (ABER, number of slides
   examined/population), collection of water specimens from potential
   vector-breeding sites, sorting of villages in categories depending on
   the number of abandoned wells within two kilometers radius and review of
   the DDT spray coverage. Cases were compared with matched neighbourhood
   controls in terms of personal protection using matched odds ratios
   (MOR). 7,303 cases and 17 deaths were reported between April 2005 and
   March 2006 with a peak during October rains ( Attack rate: 50 per 1,000,
   case fatality: 0.2\%). The attack rate increased according to the number
   of abandoned wells within 2 kilometres radius (P < 0.0001, Chi-square
   for trend). Abandoned wells were Anopheles breeding sites. Compared with
   controls, cases were more likely to sleep outdoors (MOR: 3.8) and less
   likely to use of mosquito nets and repellents (MOR: 0.3 and 0.1,
   respectively). DDT spray coverage and ABER were 39\% and 3.5\%, below
   the recommended 85\% and 10\%, respectively. Overall, this outbreak
   resulted from weaknesses in malaria control measures and a combination
   of factors, including vector breeding, low implementation of personal
   protection and weak case detection.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies, the most important malaria vector of peninsular
   India exist as a complex of five sibling species. The member species of
   the complex have various biological differences including their
   susceptibility to malaria parasites. The present attempt is made to
   study and compare the fecundity of the differentially susceptible
   members of the An. culicifacies complex. Gravid female mosquitoes of
   species A, B and C were allowed to lay their eggs individually during
   first and second gonotrophic cycle. The eggs were counted after hatching
   and categorized as `hatched eggs', `unhatched eggs', `embryonated eggs',
   `unembryonated eggs' and `non/partially melanized eggs'. The data was
   analyzed using Student's t test, ANOVA, Chi-square and Pearson's
   correlation analysis. All females that were visually categorized as
   `gravid' did not lay eggs. Species C laid maximum number of eggs per
   female. The eggs laid per female mosquito of each species were found to
   be significantly higher during second gonotrophic cycle as compared with
   the first gonotrophic cycle. The eggs hatched per female in species C
   were found to be significantly higher than that of species A and B. The
   poor-vector species B mosquitoes were found to be the least fecund among
   the members of the species complex. The unembryonated eggs constitute
   the biggest proportion of the unhatched eggs in species A, B and C of
   the species complex. (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Several studies have been made to study the
   effect of antisera raised against different tissues (hemolymh, ovary,
   midgut and salivary glands) on the fecundity and malaria parasite
   development in the different species of mosquitoes but there are no
   reports on the antisera raised against the hemolymph of Anopheles
   culicifacies, the principal malaria vector in India accounting for 65\%
   of malaria cases. Hence, an attempt was made to study the same and
   evaluate its impact on malaria parasite development.
   Methods: Polyclonal and multifactorial antibodies were produced in
   rabbits against heterogenous mixture of hemolymph proteins. Antibodies
   against hemolymph proteins were screened for their potential to
   influence reproductive performance of mosquitoes. Antibody titer in
   rabbit serum was determined by ELISA and putative candidate antigens
   were identified in the hemolymph of All.. culicifacies by western
   blotting. Cross reactivity amongst various tissues vis-a-vis hemolymph
   protein was also identified. In addition, a significant reduction in
   oocyst development was also observed in An. culicifacies mosquitoes that
   ingested antihemolymph antibodies along with Plasmodium vivax.
   Results: The maximum deduction in fecundity (57\%) was observed during
   fourth week, after the last booster and number of oocyts per infected
   mosquito reduced by 73.35\% in the group of mosquitoes that ingested
   antihemolymph antibodies along with the infected blood meal
   respectively. However, the ingestion of antibodies against hemolymph
   proteins did not have significant influence on hatchability. Antisera
   raised against hemolymph proteins of An. culicifacies recognized I I
   polypeptides by western blotting.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: During the present study, 11 putative
   candidate antigens were identified in the hemolymph of An. culicifacies,
   against which antibodies produced significantly reduced the fecundity by
   57\%. In addition, a significant reduction in oocyst development was
   also observed in All. culicifacies that ingested antihemolymph
   antibodies along with P.vivax.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in egg surface morphology and morphometrics of Culex
   quinquefasciatus mosquitoes of the Jodhpur, Bikaner, Jamnagar, and
   Bathinda strains were correlated with geographical distribution in
   different ecological regions of India. We report the geographic
   variation in Cx. quinquefasciatus based on 44 attributes of micropylar
   and conical-shaped regions of eggs, including micropylar apparatus
   (corolla, disc, and mound), micropylar tubercles, and the exochorionic
   tubercle, pores, and network in anterior, middle, and posterior regions.
   No remarkable differences were observed in the surface morphology of
   eggs of these strains except the absence of small tubercles in the
   anterior and middle region of the JMN strain. However, a statistical
   analysis indicated significant morphometric variations in 66\% of the
   attributes of the eggs. The cluster analysis of all egg attributes
   showed that the JD, BKN, and BTH strains are closer to each other than
   the JMN strain. The positive correlation (r = 0.95) also indicated an
   effect of geographical distribution on morphometry of various egg
   attributes of these strains. The present study suggests that ecological
   variation may have affected the morphometric attributes of the egg of
   four strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus from different geographical areas.}},

Abstract = {{Four sibling species in the Anopheles sundaicus complex have earlier
   been reported, including species D from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
   of India where it constitutes 58\% of all Anopheles population and is a
   major malaria vector. Earlier, we have reported the identical sequences
   for ribosomal DNA markers among the specimens of A. sundaicus from
   Andaman and Nicobar islands irrespective of their habitat. These ITS2
   sequences were also identical to the reported sequence of variant III of
   Southeast Asian A. sundaicus. In the present study, we describe
   variations in three mitochondrial DNA markers among these specimens from
   Andaman and Nicobar islands. There were two different genotypes for each
   locus of COI and COII, and three genotypes for cytochrome-b (Cyt-b)
   locus resulting in three different combined genotypes (genotypes I, II
   and III) in the population. Specimens with combined genotype I (59\%, n
   = 100) were found only among the A. sundaicus population breeding in
   fresh water whereas two different multi-loci genotypes i.e. genotype II
   (25\%, n = 100) and genotype III (16\%, n = 100) were present in the
   population breeding in brackish water. Thus, the A. sundaicus population
   breeding in fresh water was homogenous with single multi-loci genotype
   and can be distinguished from the heterogenous mosquito population
   breeding in brackish water with these markers. These Cyt-b and COI
   sequences of A. sundaicus species D were also different from the
   reported Southeast Asian species of A. sundaicus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted on the efficacy of Olyset nets-a long-lasting
   insecticidal net (LLIN) factory treated with 2\% (w/w) permethrin on
   malaria transmission in an area under the influence of pyrethroid
   susceptible vector species Anopheles culicifacies and A. fluviatilis in
   Sundargarh District, Orissa, India. The study area comprised 22 villages
   that were randomized into three clusters and designated as Olyset net,
   untreated net, and no net area. Malaria incidence in the study
   population was measured through longitudinal active surveillance at
   fortnightly intervals. There was a reduction of 65-70\% in malaria
   incidence in Olyset net area as compared to the control areas. The
   attack rate of Plasmodium falciparum or number of episodes per person
   per year in different age groups also showed significant reduction in
   Olyset net area as compared to untreated net and no net areas.
   Cross-sectional point prevalence surveys showed 45.7\% reduction of
   malaria prevalence in Olyset net users, whereas there was an increase of
   33.3\% and 51\% in untreated net and no net villages respectively. The
   compliance rate of Olyset net usage in the study population was 80-98\%
   during different months, whereas it was between 70\% and 90\% for
   untreated nets. There were minimal complains of skin irritation (4\%),
   itching (8\%) and eye irritation (1.2\%). However, these effects were
   only transitory in nature lasting for few hours of the first usage.
   Olyset nets also provided collateral benefits in terms of relief not
   only from mosquitoes and malaria but also from other household pests
   such as head lice, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants and houseflies. The
   Olyset nets were found to be safe to humans as no adverse event was
   recorded in the net users that can be attributed to the use of net. The
   study showed that Olyset nets are effective personal protection tool
   that can be used in a community based intervention programme. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Andaman \& Nicobar Islands (Indian Territory) are situated in the Bay of
   Bengal and endemic for malaria with perennial transmission. Anopheles
   sundaicus which prefers to breed in brackish water, is known as the main
   vector for malaria and maintains high endemicity of malaria. Tsunami
   waves entered the inhabited coastal areas, caused heavy devastation and
   left large areas inundated causing exceptionally high breeding sources
   for vector mosquitoes of malaria. The disaster created a new habitat
   suitable for the proliferation of malaria and other disease-carrying
   mosquitoes besides making thousands of people homeless. They were living
   in temporary open shelters, getting more exposed to mosquito bites. The
   population already had existing high parasite load. Hence, there was a
   real threat of malaria outbreak in the area. However, malaria was
   effectively controlled due to strategic planning and timely remedial
   measures. Malaria situation was monitored closely and epidemiological
   data of three subsequent years from 2005 to 2007 after tsunami were
   analysed and compared with pre-tsunami malaria data from 1986 to 2004.
   In this paper, effect of tsunami on malaria profile in these islands has
   been discussed along with action taken for its control. (C) 2009

   biocontrol techniques in the future. The leaf acetone, ethyl acetate,
   and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb,
   Andrographis lineata Wallich ex Nees, and Cocculus hirsutus (L.) Diels
   were tested for oviposition-deterrent, ovicidal, and repellent
   activities against Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae). The
   percentage of effective oviposition repellency of 92.60 , 93.04, 95.20,
   88.26, 92.80, 94.01, 95.77, 96.93, and 92.54 at 500 ppm and the lowest
   repellency of 47.14, 58.00, 56.52, 64.93, 71.09, 66.42, 50.62, 57.62,
   and 65.73 at 31.25 ppm in acetone, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts
   of Aegle marmelos, Andrographis lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus,
   respectively. The oviposition activity index (OAI) value of acetone,
   ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos, Andrographis
   lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus at 500 ppm were -0.86, -0.87, -0.90,
   -0.78, -0.87, -0.86, -0.91, -0.94, and -0.86 respectively. The OAI
   values revealed that the solvent plant extracts have deterrent effect,
   and they caused a remarkable negative response resulting in oviposition
   of very few eggs. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was
   observed 24 h after treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely
   proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional
   to the eggs. Mortality of 100\% with ethyl acetate extract of Aegle
   marmelos, methanol extracts Aegle marmelos, Andrographis lineata, and
   Cocculus hirsutus were exerted at 1,000 ppm. The maximum repellent
   activity was observed at 500 ppm in methanol extracts of Aegle marmelos,
   Andrographis lineata, and ethyl acetate extract of Cocculus hirsutus,
   and the mean complete protection time ranged from 90 to 120 min with the
   different extracts tested. These results suggest that the leaf extracts
   of Aegle marmelos, Andrographis lineata, and Cocculus hirsutus have the
   potential to be used as an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of
   the Anopheles subpictus. Therefore, this study provides first report on
   the oviposition, ovicidal, and repellent activities against malaria
   vector, Anopheles subpictus of plant extracts from Southern India.}},

Abstract = {{The Anopheles annularis group mosquitoes, subgenus Cellia Theobald
   (Diptera: Culicidae), includes five recognized species: An. annularis
   Van der Wulp, An. nivipes Theobald, An. pallidus Theobald, An.
   philippinensis Ludlow and An. schueffneri Stanton. From these five, the
   three most common species found in Orissa were considered for this study
   because of their remarkable vectorial and behavioral variation and the
   important rote they play in malaria transmission. To identify and
   understand their rote in malaria transmission we developed a single
   multiplex PCR-based assay. This assay included the detection of human
   blood feeding habit and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite presence. Of
   the 186 An. annularis mosquitoes collected, morphological
   character-based identification showed that 94 were An. annularis, 54
   were An. philippinensis and 38 were An. pallidus. However, the multiplex
   PCR assay confirmed that 91 were An. annularis, 56 were An.
   philippinensis and 39 were An. pallidus individuals after adjustments
   were made for misidentified specimens in the morphological method.
   Anopheles annularis and An. philippinensis were found positive for human
   blood, and two samples of An. annularis species were positive for P.
   falciparum sporozoites. This one-step PCR-based method constitutes a
   very powerful tool. in large surveys of anopheline populations. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Genetic variability and environmental factors may influence the
   refractiveness, propagation of pathogen and transmission of disease.
   Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is one of the widely used
   molecular markers for population genetic diversity studies. In present
   study, RAPD is used to ascertain the genetic variability in Culex
   quinquefasciatus populations collected from various Indian geographical
   locations. Out of 50 RAPD primers screened, 14 primers exhibited clear,
   concrete and distinct banding pattern showing up to 100\% polymorphism.
   Primer OPBD3 was tested with DNA of 14 geographical populations from
   India (including one laboratory population) showed 21 loci representing
   14 populations with 100\% polymorphism. The genetic diversity among the
   populations indicated the Shannon index (I) and gene diversity index
   (H(ST)), 0.48 and 0.31, respectively among the population, displaying
   rich genetic variation among the Cx. quinquefasciatus populations.
   Consensus tree showed two clusters indicating the genetic variation
   among the various geographical populations. The findings of this study
   may be useful to understand the population variation under different
   ecological conditions and development of effective vector management

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Insecticide incorporated plastic sheeting is a
   new technology to control mosquitoes in emergency shelter places and
   also temporary habitations in different locations. Therefore, field
   studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of ZeroFly (R) plastic
   sheeting treated with deltamethrin on prevailing disease vectors
   Anopheles culicifacies and An. fluviatilis and its impact on malaria
   transmission in one of the highly endemic areas of Orissa.
   Methods: The study was conducted in Birkera block of Sundargarh
   district, Orissa State. The study area comprised 3 villages, which were
   randomized as ZeroFly plastic sheet, untreated plastic sheet and no
   sheet area. ZeroFly plastic sheets and untreated plastic sheets were
   fixed in study and control villages respectively covering all the rooms
   in each household. Longitudinal studies were conducted on the
   bioefficacy with the help of cone bioassays, monitoring of the mosquito
   density through hand catch, floor sheet and exit trap collections and
   fortnightly domiciliary active surveillance in all the study villages.
   Results: In ZeroFly plastic sheeting area, there was a significant
   reduction of 84.7 per cent in the entry rate of total mosquitoes in
   comparison to pre-intervention phase. There was 56.2 per cent immediate
   mortality in total mosquitoes in houses with ZeroFly sheeting. The
   overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the trial village was only
   12.5 per cent in comparison to 49.7 and 51.1 per cent in villages with
   untreated plastic sheet and no sheet respectively. There was a
   significant reduction of 65.0 and 70.5 per cent in malaria incidence in
   ZeroFly plastic sheeting area as compared to untreated plastic sheet and
   no sheet area respectively.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Our study showed that introduction of
   ZeroFly plastic sheets in a community-based intervention programme is
   operationally feasible to contain malaria especially in the high
   transmission difficult areas.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To investigate the presence of knock down resistance (kdr)
   mutation, its frequency distribution in the principal vector of
   bancroftian filariasis, Culex quinquefasciatus from northeastern India,
   and to relate kdr genotypes with susceptibility and/or resistance to DDT
   and deltamethrin in this vectors.
   METHODS Adult female mosquitoes were collected by aspiration from human
   dwellings in two villages, Benganajuli and Rikamari, and two military
   establishments, Field Units I and II. Insecticide susceptibility tests
   were performed following WHO methods with 4\% DDT and 0.05\%
   deltamethrin. Molecular identification of kdr mutation and genotyping of
   kdr locus was performed by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and direct
   sequencing in a subset of samples.
   RESULTS Mosquitoes were resistant to DDT and showed 11.9-41.2\%
   mortality, whereas the knock down bioassay for deltamethrin suggests
   complete susceptibility to this insecticide in all study sites except
   Benganajuli. The result of AS-PCR confirmed the presence of three
   genotypes: susceptible (SS), resistant (RR) and heterozygous (SR) in the
   population. Genotype frequencies at kdr locus for DDT-resistant
   individuals conformed with the Hardy-Weinberg proportion, whereas DDT
   and deltamethrin susceptible individuals differed significantly (P <
   0.05). The efficacy of AS-PCR in detecting the correct genotype was not
   encouraging.
   CONCLUSION This is the first report from India on kdr genotyping in C.
   quinquefasciatus, and it confirms the occurrence of kdr allele in this
   vector in northeastern India. This finding has serious implications for
   the filariasis control programmes in India.}},

Abstract = {{The study investigated the development and stage specificity of
   physiological resistance to insecticides in a colony of Culex
   quinquefasciatus Say ( Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes, which are vectors
   of bancroftian filariasis in India, after selection with deltamethrin.
   Resistance was selected by exposing the larvae to the concentration of
   deltamethrin that caused 50\% mortality in the tested population (i.e.,
   LC(50)). Under continuous selection pressure, the LC(50) increased
   steadily in subsequent generations. The estimated LC(50) for the F 0
   generation was 0.409 mu g/L; the LC(50) first displayed a substantial
   increase in the F(5) generation (5.616 mu g/L) and reached 121.902 mu
   g/L in the F(10) generation. The objective of this study was to
   establish a deltamethrin-resistant colony to develop a research
   programme that will study the evolution of physiological resistance
   patterns and stage-specific resistance responses in Cx. quinquefasciatus
   larvae and adults under laboratory conditions. An approximately 298-fold
   increase in resistance was recorded after 10 generations, as evidenced
   by the resistance ratio (RR(50)). The progress and effect of the
   selection pressure in the adult stage was monitored with the World
   Health Organisation (WHO) diagnostic test. The mortality, as observed
   using the WHO diagnostic test, declined significantly from the F(5)
   generation (85\%) onwards and the highest rate of survival (65\%) was
   observed in the F(10) generation.}},

Title = {{PCR-based methods for the detection of L1014 kdr mutation in Anopheles
   culicifacies sensu lato}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anopheles culicifacies s.l., a major malaria vector in
   India, has developed widespread resistance to DDT and is becoming
   resistant to pyrethroids-the only insecticide class recommended for the
   impregnation of bed nets. Knock-down resistance due to a point mutation
   in the voltage gated sodium channel at L1014 residue (kdr) is a common
   mechanism of resistance to DDT and pyrethroids. The selection of this
   resistance may pose a serious threat to the success of the
   pyrethroid-impregnated bed net programme. This study reports the
   presence of kdr mutation (L1014F) in a field population of An.
   culicifacies s.l. and three new PCR-based methods for kdr genotyping.
   Methods: The IIS4-IIS5 linker to IIS6 segments of the para type voltage
   gated sodium channel gene of DDT and pyrethroid resistant An.
   culicifacies s.l. population from the Surat district of India was
   sequenced. This revealed the presence of an A-to-T substitution at
   position 1014 leading to a leucine-phenylalanine mutation (L1014F) in a
   few individuals. Three molecular methods viz. Allele Specific PCR
   (AS-PCR), an Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) and Primer
   Introduced Restriction Analysis-PCR (PIRA-PCR) were developed and tested
   for kdr genotyping. The specificity of the three assays was validated
   following DNA sequencing of the samples genotyped.
   Results: The genotyping of this An. culicifacies s.l. population by the
   three PCR based assays provided consistent result and were in agreement
   with DNA sequencing result. A low frequency of the kdr allele mostly in
   heterozygous condition was observed in the resistant population.
   Frequencies of the different genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium.
   Conclusion: The Leu-Phe mutation, which generates the kdr phenotype in
   many insects, was detected in a pyrethroid and DDT resistant An.
   culicifacies s.l. population. Three PCR-based methods were developed for
   kdr genotyping. All the three assays were specific. The ARMS method was
   refractory to non-specific amplification in non-stringent amplification
   conditions. The PIRA-PCR assay is able to detect both the codons for the
   phenylalanine mutation at kdr locus, i.e., TTT and TTC, in a single
   assay, although the latter codon was not found in the population
   genotyped.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, clinical data is referred to study drug-resistance patterns
   of Plasmodium falciparum in an area. This is only possible after a clear
   manifestation of drug-resistance parasites inside the human host, and
   thereafter detection by healthcare persons. The detection of spread of
   drug-resistant P. falciparum in a population, before any pathological
   symptoms detected in humans is possible by analyzing the anopheline
   vectors, transmitting malaria. In the present study we implemented a new
   strategy to detect the spread of chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains of
   P. falciparum by the major malaria vectors prevalent in selected endemic
   regions of Orissa, India. We screened A falciparum positive vectors by
   using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay and thereafter
   detected K76T mutation in the Pfcrt gene, the chloroquine-resistance
   marker, of parasites present within the vectors. This study showed
   higher transmission rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum
   parasites by Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles fluviatilis. This
   study will help in assigning chloroquine-resistant A falciparum
   sporozoite transmission potential of malaria vectors and suggest that by
   adopting the mentioned methodologies, we can detect the spreading of the
   drug-resistant A falciparum in its transmission. This approach of
   studying the anophelines during regular vector collection and
   epidemiological analysis will give the knowledge of
   chloroquine-resistance pattern of P. falciparum of an area and help in
   devising effective malaria control strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   culicifacies Giles, 1901 was studied from March 2004 to February 2007 in
   Angul District, Orissa, India, which is highly endemic for malaria.
   Adult mosquitoes were collected from human dwellings using sticking
   tubes and a mechanical aspirator. After identification, some An.
   subpictus and An. culicifacies specimens were subjected to a precipitin
   test to determine their anthropophilic index and the remaining samples
   were preserved in isopropyl alcohol for sporozoite detection by nested
   PCR. An. subpictus was the most prevalent (29.0\%) anopheline species
   detected, followed by An. culicifacies (11.6\%). The anthropophilic
   index for the An. subpictus was higher than An. culicifacies and was
   highest during the Summer season. Malaria sporozoite rates of 0.52\%,
   and 1.82\% were detected for An. subpictus and An. culicifacies
   respectively. Sporozoites were detected during the summer in An.
   subpictus and during the rainy season and winter in An. culicifacies.
   The slide positivity rate (SPR) was high during the Summer. The high
   anthropophilic index and presence of sporozoites in An. subpictus during
   the summer indicate An. subpictus is a contributory factor for the high
   SPR during the summer, and An. culicifacies is a contributory factor for
   the high SPR during the rainy and winter seasons, along with other
   anophelines. In the present study An subpictus has been incriminated as
   a vector of malaria for the first time in Orissa.}},

Title = {{Larvicidal activity of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) formulation against
   mosquitoes}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions
   of deaths every year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector
   mosquitoes has caused physiological resistance and adverse environmental
   effects in addition to high operational cost. Insecticides of botanical
   origin have been reported as useful for control of mosquitoes.
   Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) and its derived products have shown a
   variety of insecticidal properties. The present paper discusses the
   larvicidal activity of neem-based biopesticide for the control of
   mosquitoes.
   Methods: Larvicidal efficacy of an emulsified concentrate of neem oil
   formulation (neem oil with polyoxyethylene ether, sorbitan dioleate and
   epichlorohydrin) developed by BMR \& Company, Pune, India, was evaluated
   against late 3(rd) and early 4(th) instar larvae of different genera of
   mosquitoes. The larvae were exposed to different concentrations (0.5-5.0
   ppm) of the formulation along with untreated control. Larvicidal
   activity of the formulation was also evaluated in field against
   Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitoes. The formulation was diluted with
   equal volumes of water and applied @ 140 mg a.i./m(2) to different
   mosquito breeding sites with the help of pre calibrated knapsack
   sprayer. Larval density was determined at pre and post application of
   the formulation using a standard dipper.
   Results: Median lethal concentration (LC(50)) of the formulation against
   Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti was found
   to be 1.6, 1.8 and 1.7 ppm respectively. LC(50) values of the
   formulation stored at 26 C, 40 C and 45 C for 48 hours against Ae.
   aegypti were 1.7, 1.7, 1.8 ppm while LC(90) values were 3.7, 3.7 and 3.8
   ppm respectively. Further no significant difference in LC(50) and LC(90)
   values of the formulation was observed against Ae. aegypti during 18
   months storage period at room temperature. An application of the
   formulation at the rate of 140 mg a. i./m(2) in different breeding sites
   under natural field conditions provided 98.1\% reduction of Anopheles
   larvae on day 1; thereafter 100\% reduction was recorded up to week 1
   and more than 80\% reduction up to week 3, while percent reduction
   against Culex larvae was 95.5\% on day 1, and thereafter 80\% reduction
   was achieved up to week 3. The formulation also showed 95.1\% and,
   99.7\% reduction of Aedes larvae on day 1 and day 2 respectively;
   thereafter 100\% larval control was observed up to day 7.
   Conclusion: The neem oil formulation was found effective in controlling
   mosquito larvae in different breeding sites under natural field
   conditions. As neem trees are widely distributed in India, their
   formulations may prove to be an effective and eco-friendly larvicide,
   which could be used as an alternative for malaria control.}},

Title = {{Immatures of Lutzia fuscana (Wiedemann, 1820) (Diptera: Culicidae) in

Abstract = {{Objective: Rice fields are dynamic mosquito larval habitats with
   assemblage of different predator taxa, including the larva of the
   mosquitoes Lutzia. Entomological surveillance in the ricefields is
   essential to evaluate the potential of these predators as biological
   resource to regulate vector mosquito population. In view of this, a
   survey of ricefields for immatures of different mosquito species
   including Lutzia was conducted. Methods: Survey of selected ricefields
   was carried out to evaluate the species composition of mosquitoes.
   Laboratory evaluation of the immatures of Lutzia mosquitoes was carried
   out to assess its predation potential using mosquitoes and chironomid as
   preys. Results: The survey revealed the presence of five mosquito
   species belonging to the genera Anopheles and Culex and the predatory
   immatures of the mosquito Lutzia fuscana (Wiedemann, 1820). The ratio of
   prey and predatory larva ranged between 1.46 and 4.78 during the study
   period, with a significant correlation on the relative abundance of the
   larval stages of Lt. fuscana and Anopheles and Culex larvae. Under
   laboratory conditions, a single instar larvae of Lt. fuscana was found
   to consume on an average 5 to 15 equivalent instars of Anopheles sp. and
   Culex sp. larvae per day depending on its age. The prey consumption
   reduced with the larval stage approaching pupation. When provided with
   equal numbers of chironomid and Anopheles or Culex larvae, larva of Lt.
   fuscana consumed mosquito larvae significantly more compared to
   chironomids. Conclusion :The survey results and the preliminary study on
   predation are suggestive of the role of Lt. fuscana in the regulation of
   vector mosquito populations naturally in the ricefields. Since Lt.
   fuscana is common in many Asian countries, further studies on bioecology
   will be helpful to justify their use in mosquito control programme.}},

Abstract = {{The insecticide resistance status of Culex quinquefasciatus Say
   (Diptera: Culicidae) to DDT and deltamethrin across army cantonments and
   neighbouring villages in northeastern India was investigated. In India,
   DDT is still the insecticide of choice for public health programmes. In
   military stations, pyrethroids, especially deltamethrins, are used for
   insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Recent information on the levels of
   resistance to DDT and deltamethrin in mosquito populations of
   northeastern India is scare. Continued monitoring of insecticide
   resistance status, identification of the underlying mechanisms of
   resistance in local mosquito populations and the establishment of a
   baseline data bank of this information are of prime importance.
   Insecticide susceptibility assays were performed on wild-caught adult
   female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to the discriminating doses
   recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to DDT (4\%) and
   deltamethrin (0.05\%). Across all study sites, mortality as a result of
   DDT varied from 11.9 to 50.0\%, as compared with 91.2\% in the
   susceptible laboratory strain (S-Lab), indicating that Cx.
   quinquefasciatus is resistant to DDT. The species was found to be 100\%
   susceptible to deltamethrin in all study sites except Benganajuli and
   Rikamari. Knock-down times (KDT) in response to deltamethrin varied
   significantly between study sites (P < 0.01) from 8.3 to 17.8 min for
   KDT(50) and 37.4 to 69.5 min for KDT(90). All populations exceeded the
   threshold level of alpha-esterase, beta-esterase and glutathion
   S-transferase (GST) established for the S-Lab susceptible strain, and
   all populations had 100\% elevated esterase and GST activity, except
   Missamari and Solmara. Beta-esterase activity in Field Unit II (96.9\%)
   was less than in any of the other populations. Benganajuli had the
   highest activity level for all the enzymes tested. There was a
   significant correlation between all enzyme activity levels and
   insecticide resistance phenotype by populations (P < 0.05). The results
   presented here provide the first report and baseline information of the
   insecticide resistance status of Cx. quinquefasciatus in northeastern
   India, and associated information about biochemical mechanisms that are
   essential for monitoring the development of insecticide resistance in
   the area.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles subpictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus have developed
   resistance to various synthetic insecticides, making its control
   increasingly difficult. Insecticides of botanical origin may serve as
   suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future. The leaf
   acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, and methanol extracts of
   Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa ex Roxb, Andrographis lineata Wallich ex
   Nees., Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees., Cocculus
   hirsutus (L.) Diels, Eclipta prostrata L., and Tagetes erecta L. were
   tested against fourth-instar larvae of malaria vector, A. subpictus
   Grassi and Japanese encephalitis vector, C. tritaeniorhynchus Giles
   (Diptera: Culicidae). All plant extracts showed moderate larvicidal
   effects after 24 h of exposure at 1,000 ppm; however, the highest larval
   mortality was found in leaf ethyl acetate of A. marmelos, E. prostrata,
   hexane, methanol of A. paniculata and C. hirsutus against the larvae of
   A. subpictus (LC50 = 167.00, 78.28, 67.24, 142.83 ppm; LC90 = 588.31,

   suggest that the leaf hexane extract of A. paniculata and ethyl acetate
   extract of E. prostrata have the potential to be used as an ideal
   eco-friendly approach for the control of the A. subpictus and C.
   tritaeniorhynchus. Therefore, this study provides first report on the

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{129}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: A longitudinal study was carried out to assess
   the impact of indoor residual spray with Vectron (R) 20 WP (etofenprox)
   against Anopheles culicifacies and on malaria transmission in a selected
   village of Dadri primary health centre (PHC), District Gautam Budh
   Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India.
   Methods: Two villages, namely Patadi and Anandpur in District Gautam
   Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, with similar malaria incidence and vector
   prevalence were selected for the present evaluation. In one village two
   rounds of indoor spraying of etofenprox (0.1 g/m(2)) were done at an
   interval of 12 wk and the other village was kept as control where no
   intervention except intensive active surveillance for early detection
   and prompt treatment (EDPT) was undertaken during the study period.
   Entomological and epidemiological data were collected using standard
   procedures.
   Results: Persistence of the effectiveness of etofenprox against An.
   culicifacies was observed up to 12 wk. Spraying of etofenprox
   significantly reduced the density (P<0.001) and proportion of parous An.
   culicifacies mosquitoes (P<0.05) in the experimental village. There was
   a significant reduction in malaria cases in the experimental village
   during the post-spray period when compared to the control village
   (P<0.05). No adverse effect was reported by the spraymen and inhabitants
   during and after the spray.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: Indoor residual spray of etofenprox (0.1
   g/m(2)) with an interval of three months in between two rounds of spray
   produced the desired impact in reducing the indoor resting density of
   vector mosquitoes and also in curtailing malaria transmission in the
   sprayed village when compared with the control village without spray.}},

   genera and 18 species resting on vegetation were collected ill villages
   and periurban areas at dusk. Mosquito species composition and pattern of
   JEV , infection in mosquitoes varied in periurban and rural areas, In
   periurban area, Culex gelidus Theobald was abundant, msking up 49.7\% of
   total catch followed by Cidex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (44.5\%). In rural
   areas Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was predominant making up 78.9\% of total
   catch followed by Cidex quinquefasciatus Say (10.8\%), Anopheles
   subpictus Grassi (7.1\%) and Cx. gelidus (1.1\%). In light trap
   collections, Cx. gelidus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus predominated in
   periurban and rural areas, respectively. Of 50,145 mosquitoes screened
   JEV isolations were made only from Cx. gelidus and Cx.
   tritaeniorhynchus. Based oil high abundance and frequent JEV isolation,
   Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was found to be the principal vector in both
   areas, whereas Cx. gelidus plays a secondary vector role in population

   sibling species is reported for the first time. Inter-specific sequence
   divergence was greater than the intra-specific divergence. The
   phylogenetic relationships inferred from maximum likelihood, maximum
   parsimony and the neighbor joining analysis confirmed the presence of
   two unambiguous monophyly clades one consisting of species A and D and

   study area comprised 22 villages that were randomized into three
   clusters and designated as Olyset net, untreated net, and no net
   clusters. Baseline studies showed that both vector species were 100\%
   susceptible to permethrin. Results of wash resistance and bioefficacy of
   Olyset nets showed 100\% mortality in An. culicifacies up to 11
   washings, whereas 100\% mortality was observed in An. fluviatilis even
   after 20 washings. The median knock-down time for these species ranged
   between 4.55-6.00 and 4.45-5.45 min, respectively, during 1 yr of
   intervention. In the Olyset net study area, there was a significant
   reduction of 80.6, 94.1, and 76.7\% in the entry rate of An.
   culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, and other anopheline species,
   respectively, with air overall reduction of 63.5\% in total mosquitoes.
   Floor sheet collections in houses with Olyset nets indicated 39\%

   rate of mosquitoes in the trial village was only 18.0\% in comparison to
   44.2 and 79.1\% in villages with untreated nets and no nets,

   and Culex quinquefasciatus Say using Bacillus sphaericus. These have
   been now considered with a practical solution because of its specific
   and prolonged killing action against mosquito larvae. The efficacy of B.
   sphaericus were assessed against all instars of A. stephensi and C.
   quinquefasciatus separately. During the experiments, the mortalities
   were not found highly effective in dose concentration of LC(90) 0.01
   mg/l. It is recommended by the World Health Organizations in all instars
   of larvae of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. Thereafter, six
   different concentrations were used in laboratory bioassays (05, 10, 20,
   30, 40, and 50 mg/l) for A. stephensi. Similarly, in the case of C.
   quinquefasciatus, six statistically significant different concentrations
   were used (0.01, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/l) of B. sphaericus.
   It was recorded after exposure of 24 h. The percentages of mortalities
   were different for the different instars of C. quinquefasciatus and A.
   stephensi. The probit equations were drawn by the probit method. The
   result of the study distinctly showed that B. sphaericus is not
   effective on selected defined doses against A. stephensi and C.
   quinquefasciatus. This probably indicates an initiation of resistance.
   This efficacy study can be useful while detecting early resistance

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies, is a complex of five isomorphic sibling species
   A, B, C. D and E and is considered to be the major malaria vector in the
   Indian subcontinent. Despite numerous Studies, it is difficult to have a
   global view of the ecological and bionomical characteristics of the
   individual sibling species, as different identification methods have
   been used. Major biological and ecological trends such as the high
   plasticity of behaviour and the sympatry of species are addressed. In
   spite of the availability of rapid Molecular identification tools, we
   still lack important information concerning the biological
   characteristics of each sibling species. Resistance to insecticide is
   alarming as it has developed quadruple resistance in two states of
   India. An intensified and appropriate intervention measure to interrupt
   transmission is the call of the day. The authors focus On (I) reviewing
   the vectorial aspects of An. culicifacies (2) discussing recently
   published data on bionomics of each sibling species, (3) identifying
   lacunae in the understanding of the Culicifacies complex, and (4)
   exploring the possibility of proper control measures. Our understanding
   of the bionomics of all the five sibling species Would certainly help,
   keeping in mind the climatic changes we are to face in the next few

Title = {{Historical applications of induced sterilisation in field populations of
   mosquitoes}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Research on sterile mosquito technology from 1955 to the 1980s provided
   a substantial body of knowledge on propagation and release of sterile
   mosquitoes. Radiation sterilisation and chemosterilisation have been
   used effectively to induce dominant lethality and thereby sterilise
   important mosquito vectors in the laboratory. Experimental releases of
   chemosterilised males provided complete control of Anopheles albimanus
   in a small breeding population (14-15 sq km) in El Salvador. Releases of
   radiation sterilised males failed to control either Aedes aegypti or
   Anopheles quadrimaculatus in the USA. Releases of radiation-sterilised
   and chemosterilised male Culex quinquefasciatus in the USA and India
   were successful in some instances. Development of genetic sexing systems
   for Anopheles and improved physical separation methods for Culex have
   made it possible to rear and release males almost exclusively (> 99\%)
   minimizing the release of potential vectors, the females. Factors that
   affected efficacy in some field programmes included reduction of
   competitiveness by radiation, immigration of fertilized females from
   outside the release zones, and inability of laboratory-bred males to
   perform in the wild. Despite significant progress, institutional
   commitments to carry the process further were generally lacking in the
   late 1970s and until recently. Now, with renewed interest and support
   for further assessment of this technology, this paper summarizes the
   current knowledge base, prioritizes some areas of investigation, and
   challenges scientists and administrators to maintain an awareness of
   progress, remain realistic about the interpretation of new findings, and
   make decisions about the sterile insect technique on the basis of
   informed scientific documentation. Areas recommended for priority
   research status include the establishment of genetic sexing mechanisms
   that can be transferred to other mosquito species, re-examination of
   radiation sterilisation, aerial release technology and mass rearing.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of 11 commonly
   available medicinal plants and compare its efficacy in relation to
   larvicidal and mosquitocidal activities against larvae and adults of
   Anopheles stephensi (Liston). All the medicinal plants and the mixture
   were effective against larvae of A. stephensi as evidenced by low lethal
   concentration and lethal time. The lethality varied in adults and plant
   extracts of mixture; Eucalyptus globulus, Cymbopogan citratus, Artemisia
   annua, Justicia gendarussa, Myristica fragrans, Annona squamosa, and
   Centella asiatica were found to be most effective. Larval mortality
   between 80\% and 100\% was observed in mixture treatment, C. asiatica
   and E. globulus. The adults that emerged from all the treatments were
   malformed. Further, the treated larvae showed significant decrement in
   the levels of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids and affect negatively
   the presence of certain amino acids. The present findings have important
   implications in the practical control of mosquito larvae and adults in
   the aquatic ecosystem as the medicinal plants studied are commonly
   available in large quantities. These plant extracts are easy to prepare,
   inexpensive, and safe for mosquito control which might be used directly
   as larvicidal and mosquitocidal agents in small volume aquatic habitats
   or breeding sites of around human dwellings.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is an infectious disease caused by plasmodium, which lives and
   breeds in human blood cells, and is transmitted through the bites of
   Anopheles mosquitoes. Renal impairment, often caused by malaria, is
   acute renal failure (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Dengue
   virus is transmitted from human to human through Aedes aegypti mosquito
   bites. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the most severe stage of
   infection, is characterized by bleeding and shock tendencies (dengue
   shock syndrome, DSS). ARF is a less common complication in patients with
   DHF, with an incidence of less than 10\%. Mixed infections of two
   infectious agents may cause overlapping symptoms and have been reported
   in Africa and India. We report here a patient with ARF due to mixed
   infection of severe malaria and DSS. The patient presented with fever
   and had a history of repeated malaria infection. Physical examination
   revealed stable vital signs and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data
   showed hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia and increased serum
   aminotransferase. Chest X-ray showed pleural effusion. A malarial
   antigen and thick smear examination showed the trophozoite stage of P.
   falciparum. On Day 3, blood pressure dropped to 80/60 mmHg, pulse was
   120 beats/minute, weak, and body temperature 36.8 degrees C, with
   icterus. Other tests revealed an increase of serum urea nitrogen and
   creatinine levels, and serologically anti-dengue IgG antibody (+) and
   anti-dengue IgM antibody (-). Based on these findings, we diagnosed the
   patient as having both malaria and DDS. We treated the patient with the
   parenteral anti-malarial agent, artemisinin. Supportive treatment and
   treatment of complications were also performed simultaneously for DSS.
   The patient experienced an oliguria episode but responded well to a
   diuretic. The patient was discharged after clinical and laboratory
   examinations showed positive progress.}},

Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{630-633}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Anopheles fluviatilis, which ranks second
   among the major malarial vectors in India occurs as a complex of three
   morphologically identical species (species S, T and U) of which only
   species S is a vector. Hence, it becomes pertinent to have a method for
   the detection of this vector species under field conditions to map the
   distribution of this vector. An rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay has been developed
   earlier for species S of this complex using female adult specimens. In
   order to widen the range of samples on which this technique can be
   employed, the utility of this PCR assay in detecting different life
   stages/gender/parts of the vector species was studied. Also, its
   reliability in detecting a single species S in pools of species T was
   studied.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected from Malkangiri and Koraput districts
   of Orissa State where species S and T of this complex are reported. The
   wild caught fed females, after egg laying were subjected to PCR assay
   for species identification. The F1 progeny of a few PCR identified
   specimens was raised and samples at larval, pupal and adult stages were
   used for PCR assay. Single adult specimen of species S was added to
   pools containing different numbers of adults of species T and the pools
   were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR assay.
   Results: The PCR assay could detect species S from pure DNA extracts of
   the immature stages and crude DNA extracts of parts of adult/whole adult
   mosquito of either gender. Crude DNA extracts of pools of mosquitoes had
   to be diluted and used in order to obtain the species diagnostic
   fragment.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The rDNA-ITS2-PCR assay producing an
   amplicon of 350 bp. diagnostic for species S, could detect all
   stages/gender. Any part of the adult can be used for species
   identification. Further, a single adult of species S in pools of as many
   as 99 adults of species T could be detected. Application of this PCR
   assay will be useful in mapping the distribution of species S, an
   important malarial vector.}},

Abstract = {{India contributes about 70\% of malaria in the South East Asian Region
   of WHO. Although annually India reports about two million cases and 1000
   deaths attributable to malaria, there is an increasing trend in the
   proportion of Plasmodium falciparum as the agent. There exists
   heterogeneity and variability in the risk of malaria transmission
   between and within the states of the country as many ecotypes/paradigms
   of malaria have been recognized. The pattern of clinical presentation of
   severe malaria has also changed and while multi-organ failure is more
   frequently observed in falciparum malaria, there are reports of vivax
   malaria presenting with severe manifestations. The high burden
   populations are ethnic tribes living in the forested pockets of the
   states like Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and the
   North Eastern states which contribute bulk of morbidity and mortality
   due to malaria in the country. Drug resistance, insecticide resistance,
   lack of knowledge of actual disease burden along with new paradigms of
   malaria pose a challenge for malaria control in the country. Considering
   the existing gaps in reported and estimated morbidity and mortality,
   need for estimation of true burden of malaria has been stressed.
   Administrative, financial, technical and operational challenges faced by
   the national programme have been elucidated. Approaches and priorities
   that may be helpful in tackling serious issues confronting malaria
   programme have been outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles dirus and Anopheles baimaii are closely related species which
   feed on primates, particularly humans, and transmit malaria in the
   tropical forests of mainland Southeast Asia. Here, we report an in-depth
   phylogeographic picture based on 269 individuals from 21 populations
   from mainland Southeast Asia. Analysis of 1537 bp of mtDNA sequence
   revealed that the population history of A. baimaii is far more complex
   than previously thought. An old expansion (pre-300 kyr BP) was inferred
   in northern India/Bangladesh with a wave of south-eastwards expansion
   arriving at the Thai border (ca 135-173 kyr BP) followed by leptokurtic
   dispersal very recently (ca 16 kyr BP) into peninsular Thailand. The
   long and complex population history of these anthropophilic species
   suggests their expansions are not in response to the relatively recent
   (ca 40 kyr BP) human expansions in mainland Southeast Asia but, rather,
   fit well with our understanding of Pleistocene climatic change there.}},

Abstract = {{No studies have been performed on the mitochondria of malaria vector
   mosquitoes. This information Would be valuable in understanding mosquito
   aging and detoxification of insecticides, two parameters that have a
   significant impact on malaria parasite transmission in endemic regions.
   In the present Study, we report the analyses of respiration and
   oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria Of cultured cells {[}ASE
   (Anopheles stephensi Mos. 43) cell line] from A. stephensi, a major
   vector of malaria in India, South-East Asia and parts of the Middle
   East. ASE cell mitochondria share many features in common with mammalian
   muscle mitochondria, despite the fact that these cells are of larval
   origin. However, two major differences with mammalian mitochondria were
   apparent. One, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle plays as major a role in
   NADH oxidation in ASE cell mitochondria as it does in insect muscle
   mitochondria. In contrast, mammalian white muscle mitochondria depend
   primarily on lactate dehydrogenase, whereas red muscle mitochondria
   depend on the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle. Two, ASE mitochondria were
   able to oxidize proline at a rate comparable with that of
   alpha-glycero-phosphate. However, the proline pathway appeared to differ
   from the Currently accepted pathway, in that oxoglutarate could be
   catabolized completely by the tricarboxylic acid cycle or via
   transamination, depending on the ATP need.}},

Title = {{Impact of lambdacyhalothrin capsule suspension treated bed nets on
   malaria in tribal villages of Malkangiri district, Orissa, India}},
Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Insecticide treated mosquito nets are
   increasingly being used in malaria control programmes. One of the
   problems with the treatment of bed nets with conventional formulations
   of insecticides was that regular washing of treated nets diminish
   insecticidal effect. Lambdacyhalothrin 2.5 capsule suspension (CS)
   (2.5\% a.i., w/v), a new water-based microencapsulated formulation is
   reported to have wash- resistant property and longer persistence on the
   netting material than other formulations. We evaluated the impact of the
   use of nylon bed nets treated with lambdacyhalothrin 2.5 CS at 10 mg
   (a.i.)/m(2) in comparison to untreated nets and no nets on malaria in
   tribal villages in Orissa.
   Methods: Nine foothill villages, highly endemic for falciparum malaria,
   from the Primary Health Centre (PHC) areas of Khairput and Kudumulugumma
   of Malkangiri district, Orissa, were divided into three groups, each
   with a population of about 500 and allocated randomly for treated (TN)
   and untreated nets (UN) and no nets (NN). Bed nets were distributed in
   September 2001 and retreatment was done in. June 2002. The impact was
   assessed based on the changes in vector density, parous rate, malaria
   incidence and parasite rates. Indoor-resting collections of Anopheles
   fluviatilis and An. culicifacies were made at fortnightly intervals from
   fixed human dwellings. Mass blood surveys before and after distribution
   of nets and fortnightly active surveillance were carried out to assess
   the change in parasite rates and malaria incidence. Bioassays were
   conducted at fortnightly intervals on the bed nets supplied to the
   villagers.
   Results: The reductions in indoor resting catches of An. fluviatilis and
   An. culicifacies were 96 and 38 per cent in villages with treated nets
   and 2.6 and 23 per cent in villages with untreated nets respectively
   compared to no net villages. For six months following treatment, 100 per
   cent mortality of An. fluviatilis was observed on the unwashed nets and
   on the nets washed once or twice. After re-treatment, 100 per cent
   mortality of An. fluviatilis or An. culicifacies was observed for nine
   months even after two washes. Usage rates of treated and untreated nets
   varied seasonally; 58.9 and 46.3 per cent in rainy season, 48.6 and 37.1
   per cent in winter season and 38.1 and 31.6 per cent in summer season
   respectively. Reductions in malaria parasite rates were about 65 per
   cent in the treated net villages and 39 per cent in the untreated net
   villages compared to no net villages. About 75 per cent of treated nets
   and 60 per cent of untreated nets were in usable condition 19 months
   after distribution.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The estimated protection factor based on
   malaria incidence was 86 per cent for the treated nets during both
   post-treatment and post-retreatment periods and 34 and 51 per cent for
   untreated nets for the corresponding periods compared to no nets. The
   results of the study showed that the use of bed nets treated nets with
   CS formulation of lambdacyhalothrin at 10 mg (a.i.)/m(2) was acceptable
   to the community and re-treatment of nets at nine-monthly intervals can
   significantly reduce density and survival of An. fluviatilis and
   incidence of falciparum malaria.}},

Abstract = {{Sporozoites were detected in naturally infected sibling species of the
   primary rural vector Anopheles culicifacies complex in two primary
   health centres (PHCs) and a variant of the urban vector Anopheles
   stephensi in Mangalore city, Karnataka, south India while carrying out
   malaria outbreak investigations from 1998-2006. Sibling species of An.
   culicifacies were identified based on the banding patterns on ovarian
   polytene chromosomes, and variants of An. stephensi were identified
   based on the number of ridges on the egg floats. Sporozoites were
   detected in the salivary glands by the dissection method. Of the total
   334 salivary glands of An. culicifacies dissected, 17 (5.08\%) were
   found to be positive for sporozoites. Of the 17 positive samples, 11
   were suitable for sibling species analysis; 10 were species A (an
   efficient vector) and 1 was species B (a poor vector). Out of 46 An.
   stephensi dissected, one was sporozoite positive and belonged to the
   type form (an efficient vector). In malaria epidemiology this
   observation is useful for planning an effective vector control
   programme, because each sibling species/variant differs in host
   specificity, susceptibility to malarial parasites, breeding habitats and
   response to insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles minimus Theobald (=An. minimus A) and possibly Anopheles
   harrisoni Harbach \& Manguin (=An. minimus C) are important malaria
   vector species in the Minimus Complex in Southeast Asia. The
   distributions of these species are poorly known, although detailed
   information could benefit malaria vector incrimination and control. We
   used published collection records of these species and environmental
   geospatial data to construct consensus ecological niche models (ENM) of
   each species' potential geographic distribution. The status of the
   Indian taxon An. fluviatilis S as a species distinct from An. harrisoni
   has been debated in the literature, so we tested for differentiation in
   ecological niche characteristics. The predicted potential distribution
   of An. minimus is more southerly than that of An. harrisoni: Southeast
   Asia is predicted to be more suitable for An. minimus, and China and
   India are predicted more suitable for An. harrisoni, so An. harrisoni
   seems to dominate under cooler conditions. The distribution of An.
   minimus is more continuous than that of An. harrisoni: disjunction in
   the potential distribution of the latter is suggested between India and
   Southeast Asia. Anopheles fluviatilis S occurrences are predicted within
   the An. harrisoni ecological potential, so we do not document ecological
   differentiation that might reject conspecificity. Overall, model
   predictions offer a synthetic view of the distribution of this species
   complex across the landscapes of southern and eastern Asia.}},

   conditions in an urban area of Rourkela city, India for its impact on

   solution varied in different habitats. The lowest field application rate
   of 0.5 ml/m(2) remained effective for about 10-12 days and provided
   80-100\% reduction in larval abundance of anopheline species, including
   Anopheles culicifacies breeding in unpolluted water bodies. However, in
   stagnant polluted waters in drains and cesspools supporting culicine
   breeding, the biocide at the same rate persists for 5-6 days only. An
   application rate of 1 ml/m(2) to stagnant drains and cesspools, resulted
   in 84- 100\% reduction in the larval population of Culex
   quinquefasciatus over a period of 2 wk. Based on the field observations,
   an operational dose of 0.5 ml/m(2) at fortnightly intervals is suggested
   for clean water sources Supporting anopheline breeding. However, to
   control breeding of culicine mosquitoes in stagnant and polluted waters,
   an operational dose of 1 ml/m(2) at fortnightly intervals is required.
   The study showed that Bti scrotype H14 (VCRC B17) is a suitable

   colony were initiated by the brackish swamp-breeding malaria vector
   Anopheles sundaicus and fuelled by the importation of new prisoners.
   Malaria was a major determinant of the highly variable all-cause
   mortality rate (correlation coefficient r(2)=0.60, n=68, p < 0.0001)
   from 1872 to 1939. Directly attributed malaria mortality based on
   post-mortem examinations rarely exceeded one-fifth of total mortality.
   Infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, dysentery, and
   diarrhoea, which combined with malaria made up the majority of all-cause
   mortality, were positively correlated with malaria incidence over
   several decades. Deaths secondary to malaria (indirect malaria
   mortality) were at least as great as mortality directly attributed to
   malaria infections.}},

Abstract = {{The 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (3-HKT) gene plays a vital role in
   the development of malaria parasites by participating in the synthesis
   of xanthurenic acid, which is involved in the exflagellation of
   microgametocytes in the midgut of malaria vector species. The 3-HKT
   enzyme is involved in the tryptophan metabolism of Anophelines. The gene
   had been studied in the important global malaria vector, Anopheles
   gambiae. In this report, we have conducted a preliminary investigation
   to characterize this gene in the two important vector species of malaria
   in India, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi. The analysis
   of the genetic structure of this gene in these species revealed high
   homology with the An. gambiae gene. However, four non-synonymous
   mutations in An. stephensi and seven in An. culicifacies sequences were
   noted in the exons 1 and 2 of the gene; the implication of these
   mutations on enzyme structure remains to be explored.}},

Abstract = {{The adverse health effect of environmental changes brought about with
   the construction of large and small dams has often been reported. Here,
   we present results of a 5-year (2001-2005) study documenting the
   positive effect of such developmental projects in reducing malaria in an
   area where malaria transmission is mainly due to the highly efficient
   anthropophagic vector Anopheles fluviatilis with some contribution from
   Anopheles culicifacies. The former breeds exclusively in the
   slow-flowing streams and the latter breeds in a variety of habitats. The
   study was conducted in San Dulakudar village and comparisons were made
   with two control villages situated near the stream with similar
   topography and malaria transmission pattern. Epidemiological data was
   collected through longitudinal weekly surveillance and cross-sectional
   surveys in all the study villages. The mean annual malaria incidence
   rates due to Plasmodium falciparum in children of 1-5 years age group
   during 2001 before construction of dam was 1304.3 and 785.7 cases/1000
   population in dam site village and control villages, respectively.
   However, after construction of dam, there was gradual reduction in the
   malaria cases in dam site village and during 2005 the incidence was
   significantly reduced to 181.8 (P < 0.01) whereas it was increased to
   1000 in control villages without any significant change in comparison to
   baseline year (P > 0.05). A significant reduction in malaria incidence
   and parasite rate was also recorded in all the age groups in dam site
   village without registering any significant change in control villages.
   The construction of a small dam in the study village altered the water
   flow above and below the dam thereby making it unfavourable for the
   breeding of A. fluviatilis which in turn brought about significant
   impact on malaria transmission. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A study on the bionomics of malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies and
   its role in malaria transmission was carried out in two phases between
   August-July 1991-92 and 2000-01 in Galteshwar, a small village situated
   on the perennial river Mahi, Kheda District, Gujarat, where the ratio of
   cattle to man was < 1, compared to nearly equal or more elsewhere in the
   district. An. culicifacies was the predominant vector species in all
   collections and was mainly endophilic, though good numbers were also
   collected outdoors during 1991-92. Its mean human biting rates were 17.4
   (1991-92) and 10.7/man/night (2000-01) and varied significantly indoors
   and outdoors during the hot and rainy seasons, and also between
   different quarters of the night during the first phase of study.
   Anthropophilic indices reported as 22.7 and 29.4\% in samples collected
   from human dwellings during both phases were considerably high than
   reported previously from other parts of the district. The annual
   entomological inoculation rates estimated for the two study periods
   varied greatly. Estimates of vectorial capacity for different months
   during 1991-92 did not correlate with the malaria infection rate in the
   population. An. culicifacies was found resistant to DDT, dieldrin and
   malathion and the latter was used for indoor residual spraying during
   the 7-year intervening period. The study showed that the people are at a
   relatively greater risk of malaria in human settlements like Galteshwar,
   where there was little opportunity for diversion of mosquitoes to feed
   on cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Crude mature leaves extract of Day Jasmine, Cestrum diurnum (Solanaceae:

   quinquefasciatus, the vector of human filariasis. All the graded
   concentrations (0.1\%, 0.2\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 1.5\%, 2\%, 2.5\%, and 3\%
   v/v) showed significant (P < 0.05) larval mortality, and results of
   regression equations revealed that the mortality rates were positively
   correlated with the concentrations of the extract (R(2) close to 1).
   LC(50), LC(95), and LC(99) values were calculated at different time
   intervals, and the lowest value was recorded at the 72-h bioassay for
   third-instar larvae. Significant changes in the larval mortality (F <
   0.05) was also recorded between the periods of exposure and between
   instars during t test and single analysis of variance analysis. No
   mortality was noticed for nontarget organisms, such as Oreochromis
   niloticus niloticus and Chironomid larvae within 72 h of postexposure to
   1\%, 2\%, and 3\% crude plant extract under the laboratory condition.
   Qualitative and chromatographic analysis of the crude extract of C.
   diurnum revealed the presence of many bioactive phytochemicals. The
   bioassay experiment with the third-instar larval form established that
   the presence of a steroid compound (R(f), 0.67) was responsible for

   The larval mortality was observed after 24 h exposure. All extracts
   showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval
   mortality was found in the ethyl acetate extract of A. aspera. In the
   present study, bioassay-guided fractionation of A. aspera led to the
   separation and identification of a saponin as a potential mosquito
   larvicidal compound, with LC50 value of 18.20 and 27.24 ppm against A.
   aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, respectively. H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and
   mass spectral data confirmed the identification of the active compound.
   This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the
   saponin from the ethyl acetate extract of A. aspera. This study
   investigates the potential of crude extracts from commonly used medical
   herbs in India as an environmentally safe measure to control the vector
   of dengue and lymphatic filariasis.}},

Title = {{Mosquito larvicidal activities of Solanum villosum berry extract against
   the dengue vector Stegomyia aegypti}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vector control is facing a threat due to the emergence of
   resistance to synthetic insecticides. Insecticides of botanical origin
   may serve as suitable alternative biocontrol techniques in the future.
   Although several plants have been reported for mosquitocidal activity,
   only a few botanicals have moved from the laboratory to field use,
   because they are poorly characterized, in most cases active principals
   are not determined and most of the works are restricted to preliminary
   screening. Solanum villosum is a common weed distributed in many parts
   of India with medicinal properties, but the larvicidal activity of this
   plant has not been reported so far.
   Methods: Aqueous and polar/non-polar solvent extract of fresh, mature,
   green berries of S. villosum was tested against Stegomyia aegypti, a
   common vector of dengue fever. A phytochemical analysis of chloroform:
   methanol extract was performed to search for the active toxic
   ingredient. The lethal concentration was determined (log probit
   analysis) and compared with Malathion. The chemical nature of the active
   substance was also evaluated following ultraviolet-visual (UV-Vis) and
   infrared (IR) analysis.
   Results: In a 72 hour bioassay experiment with the aqueous extract, the
   highest mortality was recorded in 0.5\% extract. When the mortality of
   different solvent extracts was compared, the maximum (p < 0.05)
   mortality was recorded at a concentration of 50 ppm of chloroform:
   methanol extract (1: 1, v/v). The larvicidal activity was lower when
   compared with the chemical insecticide, Malathion (p < 0.05). Results of
   regression analysis revealed that the mortality rate (Y) was positively
   correlated with the period of exposure (X) and the log probit analysis
   (95\% confidence level) recorded lowest value (5.97 ppm) at 72 hours of
   exposure. Phytochemical analysis of the chlororm:methanol extract
   reported the presence of many bioactive phytochemicals. Two toxic
   compounds were detected having R(f) = 0.82 (70\% and 73.33\% mortality
   in 24 and 48 hours, respectively) and R(f) = 0.95 (40\% and 50\%
   mortality in 24 and 48 hours, respectively). IR analysis provided
   preliminary information about the steroidal nature of the active
   ingredient.
   Conclusion: S. villosum offers promise as potential bio control agent
   against S. aegypti particularly in its markedly larvicidal effect. The
   extract or isolated bioactive phytochemical could be used in stagnant
   water bodies for the control of mosquitoes acting as vector for many
   communicable diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulating the endogenous immune responses of the mosquito such as
   temporal and spatial expression of antimicrobial peptides may help in
   the development of a refractory mosquito, unable to transmit malaria. In
   mosquito several small antimicrobial peptides are activated locally in
   the midgut and salivary glands upon Plasmodium infection. Anopheles
   stephensi, the major urban malaria vector in India, has been considered
   as an important insect model to study vector-parasite interactions;
   however, so far no reports are available on the antimicrobial peptides
   from this mosquito species. In the present study, we report
   identification and molecular characterization of a novel cDNA encoding
   defensin like peptide, isolated from the salivary gland subtractive
   hybridization cDNA library of mosquito A. stephensi. Defensin cDNA is
   396 base pair long, bearing an open reading frame of 96 amino acids.
   Deduced amino acid sequence of A. stephensi defensin (Astp\_def)
   contains a signal peptide sequence of 24 amino acids followed by
   32-amino acids long putative propeptide domain and a 40-amino acid
   mature peptide domain carrying 23-amino acid long consensuses sequence
   signature of insect defensin. Mature peptide of Astp\_def carries six
   conserved cysteine residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 4.20
   kDa, and isoelectric point of 8.30, characteristic features of cationic
   defensins. Amino acid sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis
   indicated a higher variation in the pre-propeptide region, as compared
   to the mature defensin peptide, assuring the presence of finely tuned
   immune responses to counter pathogens. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Eleven fungal species in three genera were isolated from the soil at
   Agra, India by the feather-baiting technique. Out of the 11 species,
   Chrysosporium lobatum Scharapov, a deuteromycetous (Moniliales:
   Moniliaceae) fungus, caused high mortality of Culex quinquefasciatus Say
   (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae in the laboratory. Laboratory and field
   trials were carried out to study the efficacy of C. lobatum against
   various instars of C. quinquefasciatus. In the laboratory bioassays,
   first, second and third instar larvae were assessed separately. Conidia
   of C. lobatum that were 15 days old were used both in laboratory and
   field bioassays. Six different concentrations were used in the
   laboratory bioassays (10, 10(3), 10(4), 5 x 10(4), 10(5) and 10(6)
   conidia/mL), and one concentration was tested in the field trials (106
   conidia/mL). The LC50 values with 95\% fiducial limits and probit
   equations were calculated by the probit analysis. Significant (analysis
   o.f variance (ANOVA): P < 0.0001) mortality difference between the
   instars of C. quinquefasciatus was observed after 72 h of exposure to
   conidia of C. lobatum. The third instar C. quinquefasciatus were 319-
   and 25-fold more susceptible to C. lobatum (0.47 x 10(3) conidia/mL)
   than the first and second instars, respectively. The cuticle of the
   abdominal region and anal papillae were densely covered by the C.
   lobatum conidia. In the field trials, populations had declined
   significantly (t test, P = 0.003) 15 days after inoculation in the four
   test pools. Significantly (t test, P = 0.03) higher mortality was
   observed in the pools with water quality that was lower in total
   dissolved solids, hardness, chemical oxygen demand and conductivity.
   Based on the performance and survival in the trial, C. lobatum may be
   considered as a bio-control agent of mosquitoes.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing of the effects of insecticide used controlling the
   vectors of human diseases. Manipulating or introducing an
   auto-reproducing predator into the ecosystem may provide sustained
   biological control of pest populations. The selection of a biological
   agent should be based on its self-replicating capacity, preference for
   the target pest population in the presence of alternate natural prey,
   adaptability to the introduced environment, and overall interaction with
   indigenous organisms. In order to achieve an acceptable range of
   control, a sound knowledge of various attributes of interactions between
   the pest population and the predator to be introduced is desirable.
   Biological larviciding for the control of mosquito borne diseases is
   feasible and effective only when breeding sites are relatively few or
   are easily identified and treated. Larval control appears to be
   promising in urban areas, given that the density of humans needing
   protection is higher than the limited number of breeding sites. Since
   1937, fish have been employed for controlling mosquito larvae. Different
   types of fish have been used so far in this operational technique.
   However, use of fish of indigenous origin is found to be more
   appropriate in this operation. This review presents information on
   different larvivorous fish species and the present status of their use
   in mosquito control and provides a ready reference for workers involved
   and interested in mosquito research.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mosquitoes transmit several diseases to human. There are
   several measures for control of larvae. As part of Integrated Vector
   Management (IVM) program, the utility of floating layers of polystyrene
   beads (EPS) is a potential alternative in habitats of mosquito larva.
   EPS beads prevent oviposition of mosquito as well as killing the
   immature stages by forming a tick layer on the water surface. They are
   cheap, environmentally safe and do not need frequent application and
   remain on the surface of water for long time. The objective of the
   current study was to asses the effectiveness of two types of polystyrene
   beads of (EPS) and (SWAP) for control of mosquito larvae under
   laboratory conditions.
   Methods: Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus were used for
   experimental purposes. In each tray 250 larvae of late 3(rd) and early
   4(th) instars were introduced. The experiment was conducted on 4
   replicates for An. stephensi, Cu. quinquefasciatus and combination of
   both. Emerging of adult mosquitoes were calculated every day until the
   end of experiments.
   Results: Mortality rate and Inhibition of Emerge (IE) for Cit.
   quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi and combination of both species was
   97.8\%, 100\% and 99.07\%, respectively using EPS. In average, EPS was
   able to kill 98.9\% of larvae. The figures with SWAP were 63\%, 91.05\%
   and 72.65\%, respectively. The average mortality for mosquitoes was
   75.57\%
   Conclusion: EPS and SWAP beads can be very effective and practical for
   elimination of An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus under the
   laboratory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Japanese encephalitis is endemic in at least 21 countries including
   India with 30,000 to 50,000 cases annually. In this regard, Culex
   tritaeniorhynchus species, the major vector of JE in Karnataka State,
   India was chosen for the current investigation. Information on the
   species composition of various mosquitoes in an area is helpful to
   predict epidemics. Two years long study was conducted at Mysore to
   document the associated culicidae mosquito species in the breeding
   places of Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The larvae of Cx. trilaeniorhynchus
   and associated species have been collected from temporary and semi
   permanent ground water pools. Simultaneously they have also been
   collected from plain rice field area from a 26 km radius outside Mysore.
   Third instar larvae were taken for categorization and reared until adult
   emergence for further confirmation of the species. A total of 19 species
   belonging to 4 genera (Culex, Aedes, Anopheles and Armigeres) were
   registered from the two habitats. Four genera with 13 species were found
   to breed in ground pools as against 3 genera with 14 species in paddy
   field habitats. Culex bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. nigropunctatus, Cx.
   barraudi, Cx. hutchinsoni, An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were seen
   only in paddy field habitat, whereas Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. gelidus,
   Ae. albopictus and An. jamesii were found only in ground pool habitats.
   Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, Cx pseudovishnui, Cx.

Abstract = {{Water quality of aquatic habitats is an important determinant of female
   mosquito oviposition and successful larval development. This study
   examined the influence of environmental covariates on Anopheles
   arabiensis mosquito abundance in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme, Central
   Province of Kenya, prior to implementation of a malaria vector control
   program. Experimental rice plots were used to examine the environmental
   covariates responsible for regulating abundance and diversity of the
   aquatic stages of malaria vectors. Mosquito larval sampling and water
   quality analysis were done weekly from the flooding stage to the rice
   maturation stage. Sampling for mosquito larvae was conducted using
   standard dipping technique. During each larval collection, environmental
   covariates such as pH, temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved
   oxygen, water depth, and rice stage were measured. Anopheles arabiensis
   larval density was highest between 1 wk before transplanting and 4 wk
   after transplanting with peaks at weeks 0, 3, and 8. The fluctuation in
   values of the various environmental covariates showed characteristic
   patterns in different rice growth phases depending on the changes taking
   place due to the agronomic practices. Using a backward linear regression
   model, the factors that were found to be associated with abundance of
   An. arabiensis larvae at any of the rice growing phases included the
   following: dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, water depth, rice height,
   number of rice tillers, salinity, conductivity, and temperature. The
   environmental covariates associated with abundance of An. arabiensis
   were associated with early vegetative stage of the rice growth. For
   effective control of developmental stages of mosquito larvae, the
   application of larvicides should be done at the vegetative stage and the
   larvicides should persist until the beginning of the reproductive stage
   of the rice.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies, a predominant vector of malaria in India exists
   as a complex of five sibling species A, B, C, D and E, of which, except
   species B, all the rest are vectors with varying vectorial capacities.
   With a combination of PCR assays, it is possible to identify all the
   five members of this species complex. These assays include amplification
   of the rDNA-ITS2 region followed by digestion of the ITS2 amplicon using
   restriction enzyme, Rsa I which groups the five members of the An.
   culicifacies complex into two categories: species A and D forming one
   category and species B, C and E forming another. The samples grouped
   thus are then subjected to two allele-specific PCR assays (AD-PCR and
   BCE-PCR), which has been designed using sequence differences in the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 11 (CO 11) subunit. The AD-PCR assay
   distinguishes species A and D, whereas the BCE-PCR assay distinguishes
   species B, C and E. In the present study, the differences in the ITS2
   region of the five species was used to design a PCR assay which groups
   the five members into the same two categories as obtained after
   digestion of the ITS2-PCR product. This assay uses a common forward
   primer based on the 5.8S region and two reverse primers, which is
   specific for the two categories. Amplification of a PCR product of size
   253 bp indicates the presence of species A/D, while a product of size
   409 bp indicates the presence of species B/C/E. By using this ITS2 PCR
   assay, the three-step procedure is reduced to two cutting down the time
   and cost involved. The ITS2 PCR assay has been validated on specimens
   collected from different regions of India and the results confirm to the
   earlier reports on the distribution of the members of the An.
   culicifiacies complex. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles stephensi Liston s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the major

   village (Azakhel) outside the irrigation scheme in Northwest Frontier

   levels of genetic diversity were observed within populations (mean
   alleles per locus 10.71-11.57; mean heterozygosity 0.703-0.733).
   Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations was observed for only two
   microsatellite loci in 21 tests. No genetic differentiation was observed
   between populations and average pairwise F-ST values did not differ

Abstract = {{In an attempt to isolate mosquitocidal bacteria, 460 samples of soil,
   leaf and water were collected from mangrove habitats of Andaman Nicobar
   Islands, India. Out of a total number of 857 bacteria screened, three
   Bacillus strains showed mosquitocidal activity at promising levels. Two
   of them were identified, morphologically and biochemically, as Bacillus
   subtilis, whereas one was Bacillus thuringiensis. These strains were
   code named as B469, B471 and B474, respectively. Molecular
   characterisation using 16S rRNA confirmed the identity of B469 and B471
   as B. subtilis strains and flagellar serotyping confirmed B474 as B.
   thuringiensis subsp. israelensisltochigiensis (H4/1-H9). Amplification
   of cry and cyt genes of B474 showed the presence of cry 4A, cry 4B, cry
   11, cry 10, cyt 1 and cyt 2. Bioassay of the culture supernatants (CS)
   of B. subtilis strains showed mosquitocidal activity against larvae and
   pupae of Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinque/asciatus and Aedes aegypti.
   The mosquitocidal activity was more pronounced with the CS of B471 than
   that of the B469. Interestingly, CS of both these strains was more
   active on pupae, a non-feeding stage, than larvae of the mosquitoes
   tested. The B. thuringiensis strain was able to kill the larvae of all
   the above mentioned mosquitoes. This is the first study demonstrating

Abstract = {{Despite considerable success of malaria control programme in the past,
   malaria still continues as a major public health problem. The malaria
   control in India relies mainly on indoor residual spraying of
   insecticides, which has become a formidable task due to widespread
   resistance in malaria vectors, particularly in Anopheles culicifacies,
   responsible for a majority of malaria cases in India. The success of any
   vector control programme relies on knowledge of vector species and their
   bionomics, which is complicated due to the fact that among the six
   recognized primary malaria vectors in India, all except An. stephensi
   are species complexes. There are growing evidences that the members of
   species complexes differ significantly in biological characteristics
   that are vital for malaria control point of view such as vectorial
   potential, host-preference, resting behaviour and response to
   insecticides. Culicifacies and Fluviatilis complexes are the most
   studied vector systems from India, which together are responsible for a
   majority of malaria cases. Vector control has become less effective in
   recent years due to poor adoption of alternative tools. This review
   article illustrates an update on recent advances in the field of vector
   biology, particularly recognition of sibling species, methods for their
   identification, differential bionomics of members of species complexes

Abstract = {{Resistance to chloroquine (CQ) in Plasmodium falciparum is one of the
   main causes of the wide-spread resurgence of malaria in India and a
   challenge to the effective control of the disease. In the pilgrim centre
   of Rameswaram Island, malaria has persisted despite the various control
   measures undertaken over the years. When CQ resistance in Rameswaram was
   investigated in vivo, recrudescent parasitaemias were observed in 25
   (58\%) of the 43 study subjects who were given CQ and completed
   follow-up, all occurring between days 10 and 28 ( late treatment
   failures). The results of the msp(1), msp(2) and glurp genotyping of
   paired samples of P. falciparum, collected on day 0 and the day of
   recrudescence from 23 of the apparent treatment failures, indicated that
   21 (91\%) of the 23 were probably true treatment failures. All of the
   paired samples harboured parasites with the K76T mutation in their pfcrt
   genes, and subsequent sequencing of nine day-0 samples revealed the
   SVMNT haplotype in all nine.
   This is the first report of in-vivo drug resistance in P. falciparum
   from Rameswaram Island. Such resistance, which is probably the result of
   the indiscriminate use of CQ and/or the import of malaria from mainland
   India, warrants a change in the drug regimen used locally for the
   first-line treatment of uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria, to make
   treatment more effective and slow the development and spread of more
   foci of CQ resistance.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Thirty four species of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were collected
   across three phytogeographic zones; tropical ( 300 to 1000 m), sub
   tropical (1000 to 2000 m) and temperate (2000 to 3000 m) in the Garhwal
   region of India. They included 5 genera: Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres,
   Culex and Uranotaenia. Of these, the immature forms of 23 species were
   recovered from different breeding habitats. The larval habitats were
   seepage pools, river beds, rice fields, tanks, forest pools, ditches,
   streams, rock holes, tree holes, intradomestic containers and shallow
   pits. Three groups and two separate individual species were associated,
   based on breeding habitat similarity by means of cluster analysis. The
   characters taken into consideration for classification were natural/
   artificial, temporary/permanent, shady/ lighted, vegetation, movement
   and turbidity. Breeding habitats such as streams and rock holes were the
   richest habitats shared by 18 mosquito species followed by seepage pools
   harboring 16 species of mosquitoes. The lowest species diversity (6
   species) was recorded from shallow pits. Generally, all the collected
   species were found in natural habitats in quiet/stagnant conditions at a
   depth of 0.1-0.5 m. Generally, the maximum number of species preferred
   partially shady and temporary water habitats. Moderate vegetation and
   clear water habitats also had a diversity of mosquito species. Culex
   mimeticus Noe and Anopheles maculatus Theobald had the highest
   association coefficient (0.941) followed by Anopheles stephensi Liston
   and Anopheles vagus Donitz ( 0.884). The highest negative association
   (-0.30) was found between the species of Culex vishnui Theobald and
   Culex brevipalpis (Giles). There were a few species of mosquitoes for
   which only immatures were collected. Phytogeographically, the zones of
   lower elevation shared higher species abundance than the higher
   elevation.}},

Journal = {{BMC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The main vector for transmission of malaria in India is the
   Anopheles culicifacies mosquito species, a naturally selected subgroup
   of which is completely refractory (R) to transmission of the malaria
   parasite, Plasmodium vivax;
   Results: Here, we report the molecular characterization of a serine
   protease (acsp30)-encoding gene from A. culicifacies, which was
   expressed in high abundance in the refractory strain compared to the
   susceptible (S) strain. The transcriptional upregulation of acsp30 upon
   Plasmodium challenge in the refractory strain coincided with ookinete
   invasion of mosquito midgut. Gene organization and primary sequence of
   acsp30 were identical in the R and S strains suggesting a divergent
   regulatory status of acsp30 in these strains. To examine this further,
   the upstream regulatory sequences of acsp30 were isolated, cloned and
   evaluated for the presence of promoter activity. The 702 bp upstream
   region of acsp30 from the two strains revealed sequence divergence. The
   promoter activity measured by luciferase- based reporter assay was shown
   to be 1.5-fold higher in the R strain than in the S. Gel shift
   experiments demonstrated a differential recruitment of nuclear proteins
   to upstream sequences of acsp30 as well as a difference in the
   composition of nuclear proteins in the two strains, both of which might
   contribute to the relative abundance of acsp30 in the R strain;
   Conclusion: The specific upregulation of acsp30 in the R strain only in
   response to Plasmodium infection is suggestive of its role in
   contributing the refractory phenotype to the A. culicifacies mosquito
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The Anopheles annularis group of subgenus Cellia Theobald (Diptera:
   Culicidae) includes five currently recognized species in southern Asia:
   An. annularis Van der Wulp, Anopheles nivipes (Theobald) and Anopheles
   philippinensis Ludlow, which are widespread in the region, Anopheles
   pallidus Theobald, which is known in Sri Lanka, India and Myanmar, and
   Anopheles schueffneri Stanton, which occurs in Java and Sumatra.
   Identification of the four mainland species based on morphology is
   problematic. In view of the fact that the three widespread species are
   variously involved in malaria transmission in different parts of the
   region, we developed a species-specific polymerase chain reaction
   assay-based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences to
   facilitate entomological and epidemiological studies of the four
   species. The method proved to be reliable when tested over a wide
   geographical area.}},

Abstract = {{The Anopheles annularis group of mosquitoes is widely distributed in
   Southeast Asia and may be locally important as malaria vectors. Members
   of this group are morphologically very similar and often difficult to
   distinguish, particularly A. nivipes and A. philippinensis. We report
   the sequence analysis of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
   and Domain-3 (D3) regions of the four members of the A. annularis
   group-A. nivipes, A. philippinensis, A. annularis and A. pallidus-and a
   method for their molecular identification. No intraspecies sequence
   variation was detected among the specimens, while interspecific sequence
   differences were greater for ITS2 than the D3 regions. Comparison of the
   D3 sequences of the four species revealed two Smal restriction sites in
   A. nivipes, but only one site in A. philippinensis, A. annularis and A.
   pallidus. The Apal site was present in both A. philippinensis and A.
   pallidus, while an Ncol site was present in A. pallidus only.
   Restriction digestion of the PCR products of D3 fragment individually
   with Smal, Apal and Ncol produced a distinctive pattern for all the four
   species. We present, for the first time, a PCR-RFLP method to
   distinguish the four members of the A. annularis group of mosquitoes.

Abstract = {{Geographical Information Systems for disease surveillance play a major
   role in public health and epidemiology. Malaria is a serious tropical
   disease and micro level mapping of the disease and its determinants are
   necessary. Several studies have identified that the major malaria vector
   Anopheles breeds in pools and streams and hence the people living in
   close proximity to such breeding sites are at a high risk. The impact of
   topography and human activities on the incidence of malaria was
   investigated in a longitudinal trial study conducted in the highly
   endemic Vellar region of Salem in India using a Global Positioning
   System (GPS) and a Geographical Information System (GIS). A group of
   highly endemic villages and an uninfected village with similar
   topography were surveyed for their geographical features, distance from
   house to breeding sites, the socio economic living condition of a
   community (including the construction type of houses), and the use of
   anti-malaria measures. The results indicated significant relationships
   between the disease risk and the livelihood patterns of the infected
   community like sanitation, livestock dependence, etc. A comparative
   study against the uninfected village highlighted heterogeneous
   differences among the regions. Based on the integration of social,
   biological and geographical sciences, the present study provides the
   regional malaria control authorities an opportunity to assess the risk
   of encountering the disease infection and to plan prevention measures
   accordingly.}},

Title = {{A community-based health education programme for bio-environmental
   control of malaria through folk theatre (Kalajatha) in rural India}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Health education is an important component in disease
   control programme. Kalajatha is a popular, traditional art form of folk
   theatre depicting various life processes of a local socio-cultural
   setting. It is an effective medium of mass communication in the Indian
   sub-continent especially in rural areas. Using this medium, an
   operational feasibility health education programme was carried out for
   malaria control.
   Methods: In December 2001, the Kalajatha events were performed in the
   evening hours for two weeks in a malaria-affected district in Karnataka
   State, south India. Thirty local artists including ten governmental and
   non-governmental organizations actively participated. Impact of this
   programme was assessed after two months on exposed vs. non-exposed
   respondents.
   Results: The exposed respondents had significant increase in knowledge
   and change in attitude about malaria and its control strategies,
   especially on bio-environmental measures ( p < 0.001). They could easily
   associate clean water with anopheline breeding and the role of
   larvivorous fish in malaria control. In 2002, the local community
   actively co-operated and participated in releasing larvivorous fish,
   which subsequently resulted in a noteworthy reduction of malaria cases.
   Immediate behavioural changes, especially maintenance of general
   sanitation and hygiene did not improve as much as expected.
   Conclusion: This study was carried out under the primary health care
   system involving the local community and various potential partners.
   Kalajatha conveyed the important messages on malaria control and
   prevention to the rural community. Similar methods of communication in
   the health education programme should be intensified with suitable
   modifications to reach all sectors, if malaria needs to be controlled.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles fluviatilis and An. minimus complexes, each comprising of at
   least three sibling species, are closely related and important malaria
   vectors in Oriental Region. Recently An. fluviatilis species S, which is
   a highly efficient malaria vector in India, has been made conspecific
   with An. minimus species C (senior synonym) on the basis of homology in
   335 base pair nucleotide sequence of D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA
   (rDNA). We examined the conspecificity of these two nominal species by
   obtaining and analysing the DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal loci
   internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D2-D3 domain of 28S rDNA
   (28S-D2/D3) from those of An. fluviatilis S and An. minimus C. We found
   that the sequences of An. fluviatilis S are appreciably different from
   those of An. minimus C with pair-wise distance (Kimura-2-parametre
   model) of 3.6 and 0.7\% for loci ITS2 and 28S-D2/D3, respectively.
   Pair-wise distance and phylogenetic analyses using ITS2 sequences of
   members of Minimus and Fluviatilis Complexes revealed that An.
   fluviatilis S is distantly related to An. minimus C as compared to any
   other members of the Fluviatilis Complex. These findings suggest that
   the two nominal species, An. fluviatilis S and An. minimus C, do not
   merit synonymy. The study also confirms that the reported species An.
   fluviatilis X is synonym with species S.}},

Abstract = {{The Indian urban malaria vector Anopheles stephensi Liston was selected
   for deltamethrin resistance for 25 generations (F-25) at larval and
   adult stages separately in the laboratory. There was roughly a 151-fold
   increase in the lethal concentration (LC)(50) and a 99-fold increase in
   the LC90 in larval selection, when the F25 was compared with the parent
   colony. Similarly, adult selection resulted in a 39-fold increase in the
   LC50 and a 31-fold increase in the LC90 in the adults. Knockdown
   bioassays conducted on adults (selected at the larval and adult stages)
   against the diagnostic concentration of insecticide-impregnated papers,
   namely, deltamethrin (0.05\%), permethrin (0.75\%), lambda-cyhalothrin
   (0.05\%), and cyfluthrin (0.15\%), revealed that the adults selected at
   the adult stage were more resistant to deltamethrin and the other
   pyrethroids than those selected at the larval stage. A significant
   cross-resistance to DDT was noticed only in the adults selected at the
   adult stage, and no cross-resistance to malathion and propoxur was
   observed in the adults of both resistant colonies. Polymerase chain
   reaction studies revealed an occurrence of heterozygote level of kdr
   mutation (leucine to phenylalanine) in the adults selected at the adult
   stage. This event was not observed in the adults selected at the larval
   stage. Moreover, this is the first report on the occurrence of kdr
   mutation in Indian An. stephensi resistant to deltamethrin.}},

Abstract = {{We determined changes in species composition and densities of immature

   cycle in order to generate data for developing larval control strategies
   in rice ecosystems. Experimental rice paddies (6.3m x 3.15m) exposed to
   natural colonization of mosquitoes were sampled weekly for two rice
   growing cycles between February 2004 and March 2005. Overall, 21,325
   Anopheles larvae were collected, of which 91.9\% were 1(st) and 2(nd)
   instars and 8.1\% were 3(rd) and 4(th) instars. An. arabiensis was the
   predominant species (84.1\%) with other species, An. pharoensis
   (13.5\%), An. funestus (2.1\%), An. coustani (0.3\%), and An.
   maculipalpis (0.1\%) accounting for only a small proportion of the
   anophelines collected. Culex quinquefasciatus (65.7\%) was the
   predominant species among the non-anopheline species. Others species
   collected included: C. annulioris (9.9\%), C poicilipes (7.3\%), C.
   tigripes (7.2\%), C. duttoni (0.6\%), Aedes aegypti (5.3\%), Ae.
   cumminsii (3.5\%), and Ae. vittatus (0.7\%). The densities of the major
   anopheline species were closely related to rice stage and condition of
   the rice field. An. arabiensis, the predominant species, was most
   abundant over a three-week period after transplanting. Low densities of
   larvae were collected during the late vegetative, reproductive, and
   ripening phases of rice. An increase in larval density ten days
   post-transplanting was found to correlate with the application of
   fertilizer (sulphate of ammonia). Culicine and aedine species densities
   were significantly higher during the post-harvesting period. Our results
   suggest that the transplanting stage is favorable for the growth of
   immature stages of An. arabiensis and provides a narrow window for
   targeted larval intervention in rice.}},

   Comparison of the growth kinetics and infection rates of the viral

   29.6-33.6\%), which is four times higher compared with that of P. vivax
   malaria (7.8\%, 95\% CI = 6.7-9\%). An increasing trend was recorded in
   malaria prevalence from 30.2\% in 2003 to 46.6\% in 2004 (odds ratio

Abstract = {{`The National Health Policy 2002{''} of India and the ``Roll Back
   Malaria{''} policy makers have set up an ambitious goal of reducing
   malaria mortality and morbidity by 25\% by 2007, and by 50\% by 2010. To
   achieve these goals, problems should be identified, available evidence
   analyzed and policy should be changed early. Infection with drug
   resistant malarial parasites has a tremendous impact on health
   (prolonged recurrent illness, increased hospital admissions and death),
   health system (higher cost of treatment) and socioeconomics of the
   region. In view of the evidence of the economic burden of malaria, it
   has been suggested that second line treatment could be considered at
   10\% failure instead of 25\%. Effective schizonticidal drugs will not
   only reduce morbidity and mortality but will also reduce transmission.
   Studies have shown that prevalence of viable (as tested by
   exflagellation test) gametocytes is considerably more after the
   chloroquine or chloroquine + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment
   compared to quinine. Unfortunately, the only gametocytocidal drug for
   Plasmodium falciparum, primaquine, is also loosing its efficacy. 45 mg
   primaquine reduces gametocyte prevalence by 50\% while a new drug, 75 mg
   bulaquine or 60 mg primaquine reduces it by 90\%. Plasmodium vivax forms
   60-70\% of malaria cases in India. Relapses which occur in 10-20\% of
   cases adds to the burden. Efficacy, as confirmed by polymerase chain
   reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism to differentiate
   relapse and re-infection, of standard dose of primaquine (15 mg/day for
   5 days, even 15 mg/day for 14 days) for vivax malaria is reducing.
   Fourteen day treatment is also impractical as compliance is poor. Newer
   drugs, newer drug delivery systems are thus needed. Slow release
   formulations with blood levels maintained for one week may be useful.
   Rationale of giving primaquine in higher doses and different timing need
   to be considered. The genome of Plasmodium falciparum and genome of
   Anopheles gambiae have been unraveled in last past 3 years. This has
   given us an opportunity to develop new tools. Whatever be the tool,
   educating health care workers as well as lay public and ensuring
   appropriate use of available drug are essential to achieve our goals of
   controlling malaria.}},

   complemented by A. culicifacies sibling species C. In plain areas, A.
   culicifacies sibling species C is responsible for malaria transmission.
   The entomological inoculation rate in the forest and plain areas was
   0.311 and 0.014 infective bites/person/night, respectively, during 2003.
   Malaria transmission is perennial both in forest and plain areas but is
   markedly tow in the plain area compared with the forest area. Plasmodium
   falciparum accounted for 85.0\% of the total malaria cases during the
   study period. In forest and plain areas, the number of P falciparum
   cases per 1000 population per year was 284.1 and 31.2, respectively,
   whereas the parasite rate was 14.0\% and 1.7\%, respectively. In forest
   areas, clinical malaria occurs more frequently in children aged 0-5
   years and declines gradually with increasing age. The study showed that
   villages in forest and plain areas separated by short geographical
   distances have distinct epidemiology of malaria transmission. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of intensified malaria control interventions in an
   ethnic minority community in Betul using existing tools.
   Two rounds of indoor residual spraying with synthetic pyrethroid
   insecticide were applied and larvivorous fish introduced, followed by
   intensive surveillance for early detection of Plasmodium falciparum with
   rapid diagnostic tests and prompt treatment with sulphadoxine
   pyrimethamine.
   Pre-intervention surveys revealed a very high fever rate in the
   community in all age groups with a slide positivity rate of > 50\% with
   > 90\%P. falciparum. The post-intervention phase showed a sharp steady
   decline in number of malaria cases (beta 0.972; P < 0.0001, 95\% CI
   0.35-0.47). Monitoring of entomological results revealed a significant
   decline in both Anopheles species and An. culicifacies (P < 0.0001).
   A combination of indoor residual spraying and early detection and prompt
   treatment complemented by rapid diagnostic tests and larvivorous fishes
   successfully brought malaria under control. These approaches could be
   applied in other regions of different endemicity to control malaria in

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies, a complex of five isomorphic sibling species, is
   a major vector of malaria in India and neighboring countries. The five
   species are provisionally designated as species A, B, C, D, and E.
   Polytene chromosome examination has been the only method available that
   differentiates four members of this complex in areas where species E is
   not prevalent. However, this technique requires the mosquitoes to be in
   the half-gravid stage and thus limits its application to only about one
   fourth to one third of the total adult collection and excludes immature
   stages completely. For species E, both polytene chromosome examination
   and mitotic chromosome examination of F1 males are required. A
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on the D3 domain (D3-PCR) of
   28S rDNA and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay involving ITS2 of rDNA are available for
   the discrimination of the members of the An. culicifacies complex.
   However, both these can only differentiate species A and D from species
   B, C, and E. We report here two allele-specific PCR assays (AD-PCR and
   BCE-PCR) using sequence differences in the mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase 11 (CO 11) subunit. The AD-PCR assay distinguishes species A and
   D, whereas the BCE-PCR assay distinguishes species B, C, and E. Thus,
   with a combination of two PCR assays, namely the D3-PCR/ITS2-Rsal assay,
   followed by either the AD-PCR or the BCE-PCR assay, it is possible to
   identify individual specimens of any of the species of this complex.
   This assay system is the first, and the best available at present to
   distinguish all sibling species and especially to discriminate
   non-vector, species B from all the vector species, A, C, D, and E, of
   the An. culicifacies complex. Until another DNA-based method involving
   fewer steps is developed, this assay system can be used in all malaria
   epidermiologic studies where An. culicifacies is prevalent.}},

Abstract = {{During recent years, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) have
   been developed to overcome the problems of low retreatment rates,
   washing, and erratic dose of the insecticide resulting in the dilution
   of efficacy of the conventional insecticide-treated mosquito nets. These
   nets are treated at factory level with insecticide either incorporated
   into or coated around fibers. Olyset net, a polyethylene net with 2\%
   permethrin incorporated within fibers, is one type of LLIN. Therefore,
   these nets were evaluated for their wash resistance and bioefficacy
   against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies Giles and Anopheles
   fluviatilis James (Diptera: Culicidae) and other nontarget species. Cone
   bioassay tests produced 100\% mortality in these two vector species with
   3-min exposure. Results of the bioassays on washed nets showed 100\%
   mortality in An. fluviatilis even after 20 washings, whereas in An.
   culicifacies 100\% mortality up to 11 washings and 80\% mortality up to
   20 washings were observed. Cone bioassay tests also were performed on
   nontarget mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus Say; house fly, Musca
   domestica L.; American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.); head
   louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer; and bed bug, Cimex lectularius
   L. with 30-min exposure. Except for bed bugs, 100\% mortality was
   observed in these nontarget species after 24-h recovery period. In bed
   bugs, only 25\% mortality was observed. The density of An. culicifacies
   and An. fluviatilis was significantly reduced in houses with Olyset nets
   compared with those with untreated nets or no nets. Thus, it may be
   concluded that Olyset nets are highly effective against malaria vectors
   and moderately against other nontarget household insects.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of waste
   stabilization ponds (WSP) and wastewater-irrigated sites for the
   production of mosquitoes of medical importance. Mosquito larvae were
   collected fortnightly from July 2001 to June 2002 in Faisalabad,
   Pakistan. In total, 3,132 water samples from WSP and irrigated areas
   yielded 606,053 Culex larvae of five species. In addition, 107,113
   anophelines, representing eight species were collected. Anopheles
   subpictus (Grassi) and Culex mosquitoes, especially Culex
   quinquefasciatus (Say) and Culex triaeniorhynchus (Giles), showed an
   overwhelming preference for anaerobic ponds, which receive untreated
   wastewater. Facultative ponds generated lower numbers of both Anopheles
   and Culex mosquitoes, whereas the last ponds in the series, the
   maturation ponds, were the least productive for both mosquito genera.
   An. subpictus and Anopheles stephensi (Liston) were the dominant
   Anopheles species in wastewate-rirrigated sites, with Anopheles
   culicifacies (Giles) recorded in low numbers. This was also the pattern
   in nearby sites, irrigated with river water. Among the Culex species,
   Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was by far the most frequently recorded in both
   wastewater- and river water-irrigated sites with Cx. quinquefasciatus as
   the second most abundant species but restricted to wastewater-irrigated
   areas. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that presence of
   An. subpictus and Culex mosquitoes was significantly associated with
   emergent grass vegetation and low salinity. Regular removal of emergent
   grass along the margins of the anaerobic ponds and changes in the
   concrete design of the ponds are likely to reduce the mosquito
   production, especially of Culex species.}},

   field and an important factor contributing to their longevity relates to
   the applied dose. This study investigated the dose of insect repellent
   that travelers might normally apply to the skin.
   Method. Subjects were asked to apply a product they had purchased to the
   arms and neck, and the dose applied (mg/cm(2)) was calculated. The study
   was conducted using three different populations; 74 travelers to malaria
   endemic areas visiting pharmacies to purchase repellents before they
   left the UK, 23 travelers on safari in India, and 24 on safari in Kenya.
   Results. There was a significant difference in the mean applied arm dose
   of product (mg/cm(2)) {[}p < 0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]; UK
   1.15 (SD 0.29), India 0.96 (SD 0.23), and Kenya 1.34 (SD 0.54). Higher
   concentrations were achieved on the neck area. Few of the participants
   in the field trial used long-sleeved shirts at night. Even using 50\%
   wt/vol repellent products, 32\% in the Kenya and 25\% in the India,
   study achieved a dose of active ingredient less than 0.5 mg/cm(2).
   Conclusion. These pilot studies would indicate that travelers tend to
   apply below the optimal concentration of active ingredient of repellent
   as might be suggested by mathematical models.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the protist Plasmodium spp.
   and it currently kills more than one million people annually. The burden
   of malaria is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Southeast
   Asia. The parasite's resistance to commonly used anti-malarial drugs has
   worsened the situation in the poorest countries. The World Health
   Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 100 countries suffer from
   endemic malaria episodes. In addition to numerous control measures and
   treatments, several vaccines are at different research stages and
   trials. We have assayed RTS,S/AS02A, a pre-erythrocytic candidate
   vaccine that has shown promising protection levels in phase IIb trials
   in Mozambique. The vaccine is directed against the sporozoite form of
   the parasite, which is injected by the mosquito Anopheles spp. The
   vaccine induces a strong antibody response and stimulates Th1 cells-a
   subset of helper T cells that participates in cell-mediated immunity.
   Recent interest by international funding agencies has provided new
   inputs into initiatives and programs to fight malaria, which, under
   normal welfare and adequate social development conditions, is a curable
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Population interactions among mosquitoes in the Culex vishnui subgroup,
   which are vectors of Japanese Encephalitis, and their natural enemies
   were studied in Pondicherry, India. We tested the hypothesis that the
   breakdown of interactions between the larvae and their natural enemies
   due to drought followed by rain was responsible for the sudden increase
   in the vector population above the threshold for disease transmission
   during the heavy rainy period. We randomly sampled mosquito larvae and
   their predators in different breeding habitats and subjected the mean
   densities of prey, predator, and mosquito larvae infected with
   parasites/pathogens to covariate analysis to understand the interaction
   between prey and their natural enemies in relation to environmental
   factors. In rice fields, neither prey nor predator showed any positive
   correlation with temperature, RH, or the number of rainy days. However,
   the pathogen/parasite of mosquito immatures showed a positive
   correlation with RH. Among the mosquito predators, notonectids exhibited
   a significant positive correlation with Cx. vishnui larvae. The
   parasitic Romanomermis iyengari and pathogenic Coelomomyces anopheliscus
   also showed positive correlations with immatures. No parasites and
   pathogens of mosquito larvae were recorded in shallow water pools (SWP)
   or cement tanks (CT) during the study period. Important predators
   recorded in SWP were notonectids, damselfly nymphs, Diplonychus indicus,
   and hydrophilids. Dragonfly nymphs, gerrids, and tadpole shrimps were
   recorded in CT. In CT, prey and their predators were positively
   correlated with RH and rainy days. In SWP, there was a highly
   significant correlation between prey, predators and environmental
   factors. We conclude that rice fields are a stable ecosystem where
   regular interaction occurs between larvae and their natural enemies and
   a sudden increase in mosquito populations is uncommon. In transient
   habitats, no such stability is present and they become more important as
   breeding habitats in terms of seasonality and number. Shallow water
   pools should be seriously considered for the control of these vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change is expected to affect profoundly the
   transmission of the parasites that cause human malaria. Amongst the
   anthropogenic drivers of change, deforestation is arguably the most
   conspicuous, and its rate is projected to increase in the coming
   decades. The canonical epidemiological understanding is that
   deforestation increases malaria risk in Africa and the Americas and
   diminishes it in South-east Asia. Partial support for this position is
   provided here, through a systematic review of the published literature
   on deforestation, malaria and the relevant vector bionomics. By using
   recently updated boundaries for the spatial limits of malaria and
   remotely-sensed estimates of tree cover, it has been possible to
   determine the population at risk of malaria in closed forest, at least
   for those malaria-endemic countries that lie within the main blocks of
   tropical forest. Closed forests within areas of malaria risk cover
   approximately 1.5 million km(2) in the Amazon region, 1.4 million km(2)
   in Central Africa, 1.2 million km(2) in the Western Pacific, and 0.7
   million km(2) in South-east Asia. The corresponding human populations at
   risk of malaria within these forests total 11.7 million, 18.7 million,
   35.1 million and 70.1 million, respectively. By coupling these numbers
   with the country-specific rates of deforestation, it has been possible
   to rank malaria-endemic countries according to their potential for
   change in the population at risk of malaria, as the result of
   deforestation. The on-going research aimed at evaluating these
   relationships more quantitatively, through the Malaria Atlas Project
   (MAP), is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Species of the Anopheles fluviatilis James and Anopheles minimus
   complexes (Diptera: Culicidae) are difficult to distinguish
   morphologically. Members of the two complexes have been confused and,
   consequently, their distributions and roles in malaria transmission are
   uncertain. We identified numerous mosquitoes from China, Thailand,
   Vietnam, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Iran by single-strand conformation
   polymorphism (SSCP) and/or sequencing, and analysed the variation in the
   28S D3 region of ribosomal DNA for members of the Minimus Subgroup and
   also the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) for members of the
   An. fluviatilis complex. The D3 region is highly conserved between taxa
   and therefore could serve as a standard for molecular diagnosis of the
   subgroup members. D3 sequence, bionomics and malaria transmission data
   provide further evidence that An. fluviatilis S in India is conspecific
   with An. minimus C in South-east Asia. An. fluviatilis T has three ITS2
   haplotypes (designated T1, T2 and Y) and its distribution in India,
   Nepal, Pakistan and Iran is confirmed. An. fluviatilis U is well defined
   on cytogenetic grounds in Uttar Pradesh, India, but is very close to An.
   fluviatilis T and the two species may hybridize in some regions. Variant
   ITS2 sequences suggest the possible existence of two additional taxa

   Until recently, only sibling species B was reported to be present in Sri

   morphology that what was reported as B on the island is really a mixture
   of B and E. The fecundity, longevity and insecticide resistance of B and
   E are of relevance to malaria transmission and its control and are
   reported in this study. The mean egg production of these two sibling
   species did not differ significantly. The mean age of wild mosquitoes
   was assessed by the Polovodova technique of observing ovarian
   dilatations. More of species E than B had three or more dilatations,
   i.e. had reached an age at which sporozoites could have developed to
   maturity, although the difference between the species was of borderline
   significance. Following feeding on Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium
   falciparum infected blood, some females of species E developed oocysts
   but none of species B did so. Both sibling species were found fully

   We collected 98 pools (4900 specimens) of wild adult male An. subpictus

   Four pools of male An. subpictus tested positive. This indicates
   possible natural transovarial transmission of the virus through An.
   subpictus. Nineteen female pools were positive with a minimum infection
   rate of 2.3. From January through March the maximum infection rate was

   October to December, although the difference was not statistically
   significant. From the 19 positive female pools, four isolates were
   confirmed as JEV by insect bioassay.

Abstract = {{Anopheles stephensi Liston is an important malaria vector in Hormozgan
   province, where it is the most prevalent anopheline mosquito. It shows
   two annual activity peaks, one in spring and another in the autumn. In
   mountainous areas the second peak starts earlier than in coastal
   regions. Adults are endophilic and endophagic, but in the hot season
   when people sleep outside buildings they frequently bite outdoors.
   Larvae are found in a wide-range of habitats, both natural and man-made.
   All three biological forms of the species, occur in the province, i.e.
   An. stephensi stephensi (type form), An. stephensi mysorensis, and the
   intermediate form. An. stephensi mysorensis is found only in
   rural-mountainous areas, whereas the type and intermediate forms occur
   in urban-coastal regions and the rural plains, with the type form
   predominant. The presence of the type form in urban areas and mysorensis
   in rural areas is consistent with the available epidemiological data for
   malaria in the region and with the finding in India that the type form
   is an efficient malaria vector inhabiting urban areas whereas mysorensis
   is rural and has a lower vectorial capacity. Insecticide susceptibility
   tests on field collected adult mysorensis and adults from laboratory
   strains of the type and intermediate forms were carried out according to
   WHO standard methods. These showed that all three forms are susceptible
   to bendiocarb, propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion, deltamethrin,
   permethrin, cyfluthrin, and lambdacyhalothrin, but are resistant to DDT
   and show low level of tolerance to dieldrin. Examination of the
   larvicidal activity of malathion, fenitrothion, temephos and
   chlorpyrifos at diagnostic doses showed that these stephensi forms are
   susceptible to all larvicides except fenitrothion. Irritability tests to
   pyrethroid insecticides showed high levels of irritability to permethrin
   and lambdacyhalothrin, but low irritability to cyfluthrin and
   deltamethrin. The importance of these findings for the epidemiology and
   control of malaria in the region are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objectives of the study were to define the infectious
   reservoir of malaria with particular reference to transmission dynamics
   of Plasmodium falciparum, and to ascertain the disease trends in view of
   the existing containment practices and treatment seeking behavior in
   malaria endemic communities of Assam, India.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in population groups of
   malaria endemic districts of the state to determine parasite prevalence,
   and data were analysed retrospectively for the years 1991-2003 to
   ascertain the disease trends. Structured questionnaire based surveys
   were conducted to study the treatment seeking behavior and practices of
   healthcare providers.
   Results: P. falciparum and P. vivax were the only two parasite species
   encountered, the former being in the majority (> 60\%). Malaria
   transmission was persistent, and a seasonal peak of P. falciparum was
   consistently observed during the months of heavy rainfall (April to
   September). Among children (5-15 years) there was a significantly higher
   malaria parasite rate as compared to the < 5 years age group and adults
   (> 15 years). There was a decline in parasite rates for all age groups
   over the years of the study that could not be attributed to vector
   control intervention intensities and/or meteorological factors.
   Conclusions: The persistence of P. falciparum is attributed to the
   emergence of drug resistant varieties, inadequate interventions and
   treatment seeking patterns, and for its containment focused intervention
   measures are advocated in partnership with the communities. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{The anomaly that Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae) Species B
   is a major vector of malaria in Sri Lanka, but a non-vector in India,
   has been noted for several years. In 1999, a Y chromosome dimorphism
   associated with Plasmodium vivax infectivity within the Indian A.
   culicifacies species B suggested that this was itself a complex of two
   sibling species, B and E. A recent cytogenetic analysis shows the
   sympatric presence of these sibling species in Sri Lanka, a situation
   similar to that reported from nearby Rameshwaram Island, India. Species
   E, with a submetacentric Y chromosome, is a more effective vector of P.
   vivax than species B with an acrocentric Y chromosome. Larval
   karyotyping, however, is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Recently,
   the development of a PCR-RFLP assay distinguishing species B and E of A.
   culicifacies from India, based oil differences in one region of the
   cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene, was reported. Here we show
   that whilst this diagnostic approach reveals polymorphism in Sri Lankan
   A. culicifacies, this variation is not correlated with Y chromosome
   karyotype. Hence this assay will not be useful for distinguishing
   Species B and E in Sri Lanka. Further, we found no difference between
   the sequences of Sri Lankan specimens in any of three other regions
   (ITS2, D3 region of 28S rDNA, and guanylate cyclase intron) often Used

Abstract = {{Malaria is a major public health illness in Assain that contributes >
   5\% of the reported cases in the country annually. Both Plasmodium
   falciparum and P. vivax occur in abundance, but P. falciparum (the
   killer parasite) accounts for > 60\% of the cases. Transmission of the
   malaria pathogen is persistent, and is maintained mostly by Anopheles
   minimus; other vectors are An. dirus and An. fluviatilis. There is an
   imperative need for better reporting system for evidence-based
   targetting of interventions, and to save operational costs. We propose
   that control programmes targetted at the population groups at high-risk
   (estimated to be -40\% of the total population of the state that
   accounts for > 60\% of cases) can be potentially highly effective in
   reducing transmission of the causative parasite. We call for greater
   coordination/political commitment for organized control operations along
   border areas by the respective state governments to thwart the
   development and spread of multidrug resistant malaria, and thus save
   lives. Concerted efforts should be made for strengthening the health
   infrastructure at the periphery for better case management to avert and
   possibly delay the emergence of drug-resistant malaria, and help ensure
   equitable growth and development of communities at stake. The present
   article is an attempt to stratify malaria endemic districts, and delimit
   the borders for prioritizing intervention strategies for effective
   control of the disease in the northeastern region of India.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles (Cellia) sundaicus (Rodenwaldt) is an important malaria vector
   in the Andaman and Nicobar islands of India where it breeds in
   freshwater as well as in brackish water. To establish the molecular
   identity of An. sundaicus on these islands we analyzed samples from four
   geographically isolated areas-Teressa, Nancowry, Car Nicobar and Katchal
   islands. PCR-amplification and nucleotide sequence analysis were
   performed for internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and domain-3 (D3) of
   28S rRNA. The ITS2 region of An. sundaicus from all four islands was
   identical but different from An. sundaicus A of Vietnam and An.
   sundaicus s.s of Malaysia. Furthermore, freshwater and brackish water
   forms of An. sundaicus did not reveal any sequence variation. Similarly,
   the D3 sequences were identical among all An. sundaicus samples from the
   four islands. D3 sequences for a species of the Sundaicus Complex are
   reported here for the first time and thus could not be compared with
   other regional isolates of this species. In conclusion, probably only
   one member of the Sundaicus Complex exists on the Andaman and Nicobar
   islands, which breeds in freshwater as well as in brackish water and is
   different from the An. sundaicus A and Malaysian An. sundaicus s.s. The
   identification of a new sibling species of the Sundaicus Complex in
   these islands is significant from the viewpoint of vector control
   strategies. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of genetic control of insect pests and vectors was invented
   independently three times in the 1930s-40s. Results with releases of
   radiation-sterilized male tsetse have been encouraging. Much work was
   done in the 1970s on mosquitoes with sterile males and systems that
   could potentially be used for gene driving. Chemosterilized Anopheles
   separated from females by a genetic sexing system was successfully
   released in El Salvador. In India chemosterilization, cytoplasmic
   incompatibility, translocations and meiotic drive were tested with
   culicine mosquitoes in field cages, for mating competitiveness in the
   field and in some cases in village-wide release trials. However, a
   town-wide eradication attempt with Aedes aegypti was stopped due to
   spurious claims about biological warfare. This experience underlines the
   need for very careful attention to relations with journalists,
   politicians and the general public. Transgenic sterile males, which are
   now available, should have considerable advantages over radiation and
   chemosterilization and would seem well suited for eradication of urban
   vector populations.}},

   2005) (Diptera: Culicidae), at different hours of the night in a
   forest-fringed village of Assam, North-east India was assessed through
   all-night mosquito landing catches during 1995-2000. An estimated
   overall mean biting rate of 36.1 bites/person/night (95\% CI =
   26.2-45.8), a sporozoite rate of 1.9\% (95\% CI = 1.1-2.9\%) and a
   parous rate of 58.7\% (95\% CI = 55.3-62.0\%) were recorded. Parous and
   sporozoite-positive females tended to be caught mainly before midnight.
   The effective entomological inoculation rate was the highest (0.249
   positive bites/person/night) from 21.00 to 24.00 hours, suggesting that
   the second quartile of the night is the most risky period for malaria
   transmission by An. baimaii. Considering that similar to 21\% of mean
   inoculations take place before 21.00 hours, it appears that there is a
   need for appropriate protective measures during the pre-bed time period
   to supplement the impact of insecticide-treated nets against An. baimaii
   in north-east India.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles minimus, an important malaria vector of South East Asia, has
   reappeared in the Singhbum hills, East-Central India where deforestation
   and DDT residual spraying had reportedly eliminated it during the
   Malaria Eradication Programme. The species reported has been identified
   as sibling species A of the An. minimus complex. An. minimus is
   susceptible to both deltamethrin and DDT. The study shows that the
   environmental conditions in this region still favour the existence of
   the species and one of the possible reasons for its reappearance may be
   the scaling down of residual insecticide spraying in the area. (c) 2005

   include two additional species of anthropophilic P. falciparum malaria
   vectors and reanalyze these relationships using a Bayesian method that
   allows us to simultaneously incorporate different models of evolution.
   We report data that indicate a paraphyletic relationship between five
   anthropophilic African mosquito vectors. Such a relationship suggests
   that these species can serve as independent natural experiments for

Abstract = {{The use of chemicals or bio-larvicides for the control of Culex
   quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi breeding in pit latrines and
   overhead tanks (OHT) respectively is discouraged owing to many
   undesirable impacts in the environment. Due to faecal contamination and
   poor survival, use of predatory fish in OHTs is not feasible. The use of
   expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads is a potential alternative in these
   habitats. EPS beads not only prevent oviposition but also kill the
   immature by forming a thick blanket on the water surface. A thick layer
   of 2cm with beads of 2mm is sufficient to suppress and prevent mosquito
   breeding. These are cheap, environmentally safe and do not need frequent
   application since they remain on the surface for quiet a long time.
   Successful trials against C. quinquefasciatus breeding in pit latrines,
   soakage pits, septic tanks, etc., have been carried out in Kenya,
   Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Certain trials with EPS indicated reduction in
   microfilaria (mf) rate besides decline in biting density. In India, EPS
   beads have also been used on small scale for the control of A. stephensi
   and A. culicifacies breeding in OHTs and unused wells respectively. The
   polystyrene beads have also been reported to be effective in the control
   of mosquito breeding in biogas plants and other industrial situations.
   The practical utility of EPS beads in the control of vector-borne

Abstract = {{Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating disease overwhelmingly
   caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, which is transmitted by various mosquito
   species. Here, we present a systematic literature review with the
   following objectives: (i) to establish global and regional estimates of
   populations at risk of LF with particular consideration of water
   resource development projects, and (ii) to assess the effects of water
   resource development and management on the frequency and transmission
   dynamics of the disease. We estimate that globally, 2 billion people are
   at risk of LF. Among them, there are 394.5 million urban dwellers
   without access to improved sanitation and 213 million rural dwellers
   living in close proximity to irrigation. Environmental changes due to
   water resource development and management consistently led to a shift in
   vector species composition and generally to a strong proliferation of
   vector populations. For example, in World Health Organization (WHO)
   subregions 1 and 2, mosquito densities of the Anopheles gambiae complex
   and Anopheles funestus were up to 25-fold higher in irrigated areas when
   compared with irrigation-free sites. Although the infection prevalence
   of LF often increased after the implementation of a water project, there
   was no clear association with clinical symptoms. Concluding, there is a
   need to assess and quantify changes of LF transmission parameters and
   clinical manifestations over the entire course of water resource
   developments. Where resources allow, integrated vector management should
   complement mass drug administration, and broad-based monitoring and
   surveillance of the disease should become an integral part of
   large-scale waste management and sanitation programs, whose basic
   rationale lies in a systemic approach to city, district, and regional
   level health services and disease prevention.}},

Abstract = {{A field trial was carried out in the Sundargarh district of Orissa,
   India on the efficacy of mosquito nets treated with a tablet formulation
   of deltamethrin (K-O TAB((R))) against malaria vectors. Treated nets
   were used in one village, and in the two control villages, one used
   untreated nets and the other used indoor spraying with DDT, without
   nets. In this area the primary malaria vectors are Anopheles
   culicifacies Giles sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae) and An. fluviatilis
   James s.l., which are both endophagic and endophilic, and fully
   susceptible to deltamethrin. Treatment of a 10-m(2) mosquito net with
   one of the tablets gave a deltamethrin deposit of 25 mg/m(2). Bioassays
   repeated on domestically used nets over 7 months showed persistence of
   almost 100\% mortality of An. fluviatilis, whereas An. culicifacies
   showed a decline from 100\% to 71\% mortality over this period, after
   which the nets were re-treated and bioassays were not continued. The sum
   of collections of mosquitoes resting in village houses and those in exit
   traps and dead on floor sheets showed a reduction in the numbers of the
   two vector species due to the treated nets, compared with untreated or
   no nets, but no reduction in other anophelines or Culex species. Large
   proportions of the collections of the vector and non-vector anophelines
   were dead on the floor sheets, but among Culex, mortality was delayed.
   Treated and untreated nets reduced the proportion of anophelines that
   had blood-fed; the treated nets did so more effectively than the
   untreated in the case of An. culicifacies and of Culex mosquitoes. In
   rooms with treated nets a larger proportion of the total collections
   {[}dead + live] were in the exit traps, which can be attributed to the
   excito-repellent effect of deltamethrin. It is easier to pack and handle
   tablets of insecticide than liquid concentrate and the use of one tablet
   per net may be preferable to making up a large volume of diluted
   insecticide and dipping many nets at a time.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies Giles is a complex of five sibling species,
   provisionally designated as species A, B, C, D and E. Species A, C, D
   and E are vectors of malaria in India. Species A, B, C and D can be
   identified by polytene chromosome examination except in areas where
   species B and E are sympatric. Species B and E share the same
   configuration of the polytene chromosomes but can be differentiated by
   examining the mitotic chromosomes of F, progeny from field collection.
   Further, polytene chromosome examination method requires the mosquitoes
   to be at the semigravid stage, which limits on use of this method to a
   very small proportion of the population. The present study investigated
   whether the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method can be used to differentiate the members
   of this complex. Complete ITS2 region along with part of the 5.8S and
   28S rDNA sequences (512 bp) and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 11
   (530 bp) were amplified and digested with different restriction
   endonucleases. The Alu I digest of the COII amplicon and Rsa I digest of
   the ITS2 amplicon could distinguish two categories: species A and D
   forming one category and species B, C and E forming another. Further,
   Dde I digestion of the COII amplicon could distinguish species E from
   species B and C within the latter category. The PCR-RFLP techniques
   developed in this study can be applied to areas where species A and B

Title = {{Altered environment and risk of malaria outbreak in South Andaman,
   Andaman \& Nicobar Islands, India affected by tsunami disaster}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pools of salt water and puddles created by giant waves from
   the sea due to the tsunami that occurred on 26(th) December 2004 would
   facilitate increased breeding of brackish water malaria vector,
   Anopheles sundaicus. Land uplifts in North Andaman and subsidence in
   South Andaman have been reported and subsidence may lead to
   environmental disturbances and vector proliferation. This warrants a
   situation analysis and vector surveillance in the tsunami hit areas
   endemic for malaria transmitted by brackish water mosquito, An.
   sundaicus to predict the risk of outbreak.
   Methods: An extensive survey was carried out in the tsunami-affected
   areas in Andaman district of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India to
   assess the extent of breeding of malaria vectors in the habitats created
   by seawater flooding. Types of habitats in relation to source of
   seawater inundation and frequency were identified. The salinity of the
   water samples and the mosquito species present in the larval samples
   collected from these habitats were recorded. The malaria situation in
   the area was also analysed.
   Results: South Andaman, covering Port Blair and Ferrargunj sub
   districts, is still under the recurring phenomenon of seawater intrusion
   either directly from the sea or through a network of creeks. Both daily
   cycles of high tides and periodical spring tides continue to cause
   flooding. Low-lying paddy fields and fallow land, with a salinity
   ranging from 3,000 to 42,505 ppm, were found to support profuse breeding
   of An. sundaicus, the local malaria vector, and Anopheles subpictus, a
   vector implicated elsewhere. This area is endemic for both vivax and
   falciparum malaria. Malaria slide positivity rate has started increasing
   during post-tsunami period, which can be considered as an indication of
   risk of malaria outbreak.
   Conclusion: Paddy fields and fallow land with freshwater, hitherto not
   considered as potential sites for An. sundaicus, are now major breeding
   sites due to saline water. Consequently, there is a risk of vector
   abundance with enhanced malaria transmission potential, due to the
   vastness of these tsunami-created breeding grounds and likelihood of
   them becoming permanent due to continued flooding in view of land
   subsidence. The close proximity of the houses and paucity of cattle may
   lead to a higher degree of man/vector contact causing a threat of
   malaria outbreak in this densely populated area. Measures to prevent the
   possible outbreak of malaria in this tsunami-affected area are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Entomological studies conducted during monsoon and post-monsoon season

   nigrostriatus, Malaya genurostris, Aediomyia catasticta and
   Toxorhynchites splendens which were not reported earlier from this
   state-have been recorded in the present study. With the addition of
   these seven species of mosquitoes to the earlier record of mosquitoes so

Abstract = {{A morphological comparison and molecular study of the Afrotropical
   Funestus and Afro-Oriental Minimus groups within the Myzomyia series of
   Anopheles (Cellia) was conducted to determine their phylogenetic
   affinities. Relationships were investigated using morphological
   characters and ribosomal (D3) and mitochondrial (COII) nucleotide
   sequences. Cross-identification of specimens from one group by using
   keys for the other group confirmed their morphological similarity, i.e.,
   members of one group shared the key characters with members of the other
   group. Molecular analyses recognized five clades, not strictly related
   to geographical distribution: the Aconitus, Culicifacies, Funestus,
   Minimus, and Rivulorum Subgroups. Morphological observations were
   congruent with the results of molecular analyses. Anopheles leesoni, all
   Afrotropical species, is closely related to the Oriental Minimus
   complex, and these taxa share a close relationship with the Fluviatilis
   complex that occurs from the Arabian Peninsula through India. The
   immature and adult stages of An. rivulorum in Africa bear morphological
   characters that distinguish this species from members of the
   Afrotropical Funestus subgroup. A composite scheme of classification
   based on the results and previously published information is proposed
   for the two groups. It is noted that An.fluvialitis species S is
   conspecific with An. minimus species C.}},

   holes in the forest, landing on humans in the guesthouse, and in the
   forest, and in light traps. Larvae were obtained from tree holes in the
   forest. The list of species recorded is not conclusive due to the

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Among Oriental anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), several major
   vectors of forest malaria belong to the group of Anopheles (Cellia)
   leucosphyrus Donitz. We have morphologically examined representative
   material (> 8000 specimens from seven countries) for taxonomic revision
   of the Leucosphyrus Group. Six new species are here described from
   adult, pupal and larval stages (with illustrations of immature stages)
   and formally named as follows: An. latens n. sp. (= An. leucosphyrus
   species A of Baimai etal., 1988b), Ail. cracens n. sp., Ail. scanloni n.
   sp., An. baimaii n. sp. (formerly An. dirus species B, C, D,
   respectively), An. mirans n. sp. and Ail. recens n. sp. Additionally,
   An. elegans (James) is redescribed and placed in the complex of An.
   dirus Peyton \& Harrison (comprising Ail. baimaii, An. cracens, An.
   dirus, An. elegans, An. nemophilous Peyton \& Ramalingam, An. scanloni
   and An. takasagoensis Morishita) of the Leucosphyrus Subgroup, together
   with An. baisasi Colless and the An. leucosphyrus complex (comprising
   An. balabacensis Balsas, Ail. introlatus Baisas, An. latens and An.
   leucosphyrus). Hence, the former Elegans Subgroup is renamed the Hackeri
   Subgroup (comprising An. hackeri Edwards, An. pujutensis Colless, Ail.
   recens and An. sulawesi Waktoedi).
   Distribution data and bionomics of the newly defined species are given,
   based on new material and published records, with discussion of
   morphological characters for species distinction and implications for
   ecology and vector roles of such species. Now these and other members of
   the Leucosphyrus Group are identifiable, it should be possible to
   clarify the medical importance and distribution of each species. Those
   already regarded as vectors of human malaria are: Ail. baimaii
   {[}Bangladesh, China (Yunnan), India (Andamans, Assam, Meghalaya, West
   Bengal), Myanmar, Thailand]; An. latens {[}Borneo (where it also
   transmits Bancroftian filariasis), peninsular Malaysia, Thailand];
   probably Ail. cracens (Sumatra, peninsular Malaysia, Thailand);
   presumably An. scanloni (Thailand); perhaps All. elegans (the Western
   Ghat form of An. dirus, restricted to peninsular India); but apparently
   not An. recens (Sumatra) nor Ail. mirans {[}Sri Lanka and south-west
   India (Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu)), which is a natural vector of
   simian malarias. Together with typical An. balabacensis, An. dirus and
   An. leucosphyrus, therefore, the Leucosphyrus Group includes about seven
   important vectors of forest malaria, plus at least a dozen species of no
   known medical importance, with differential specific distributions
   collectively spanning > 5000 km from India to the Philippines.}},

Abstract = {{Persistence, wash-resistance, and shelf life of mosquito nets treated
   with a water-dispersible tablet formulation of synthetic pyrethroid
   insecticide deltamethrin (K-O TAB (R)) at 25 mg/m(2) was evaluated
   against malaria vectors in India. During June 2001, treated and
   untreated polyester, nylon, and cotton nets were separately distributed
   in 3 villages and cone bioassays were performed on Anopheles
   culicifacies and An. stephensi 1 day after treatment and thereafter
   every month for 12 months. The mosquitoes were exposed for 3 min on the
   nettings (treated and unwashed, or treated and washed once or twice in 3
   months, and untreated) and knock-down (1 h) and 24 h postexposure
   mortality were recorded. Unwashed polyester nets, and those washed once
   1 month after treatment, gave 100\% mortality in An. culicifacies for 6
   months. A 2nd wash at 3 months after treatment marginally reduced the
   insecticidal action. Anopheles stephensi was fully susceptible up to 4
   months when exposed to unwashed nets but washing considerably reduced
   insecticidal action (65-78\% after 2 washes). Treated nylon and cotton
   nets were effective for 4 months on both vectors. Treated nets kept on
   shelf retained 100\% efficacy for 10 months. Overall, the treated nets
   gave a considerably long persistence of insecticidal action even after a
   single wash. Treated polyester nets were found most effective. Compared
   with our earlier experiences of using liquid formulations, the tablet
   formulation is likely to have a better community acceptance in treating
   nets.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the incidence of malaria in most of the districts of
   Maharashtra has reduced but the problem in Gadchiroli district was still
   persisting in spite of implementation of the main tools of intervention,
   i.e. indoor residual spray (IRS) by deltamethrin and fever radical
   treatment (FRT) to all fever cases. A study was made to find out the
   reasons for persistence of malaria in Gadchiroli district during
   November 2002. The coverage of two rounds of IRS by synthetic
   pyrethroids was around 85\%. Detailed parasitological survey revealed
   that slide positivity rate ranged from 3.22 to 42.8 and P.falciparum was
   sensitive to chloroquine in majority of the subjects (92.6\%).
   Twenty-five per cent of positive cases detected were having gametocyte
   stage of P. falciparum parasite, indicating that compliance to FRT was
   not satisfactory. Entomological findings revealed that the main vector,
   Anopheles culicifacies was resting indoor and was 100\% sensitive to
   deltamethrin. Results of cone bioassay indicated that on the wall
   surface sprayed before nine days, mortality of An. culicifacies was
   around 67.8\%, while the mortality was only 13\% on the surface sprayed
   before one month, indicating unsatisfactory quality of spray. An insight
   into the reasons for persistence of malaria revealed that the
   intervention measures were being affected by the social factors. The
   findings emphasize the importance of health education to community and
   their involvement in malaria control for achieving best results.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria was a major problem in a sericulture area of Karnataka, south
   India, where Anopheles culicifacies s.l. and A. fluviatilis s.l. were
   considered to be the main vectors. Sibling species complexes of these
   two species were analysed in three ecologically different villages.
   Among A. culicifacies, only sibling species A and B were found. In
   Puram, a village with 22 welts, species A predominated; species B
   predominated in a village with four welts and a stream, and in a village
   with a stream and no welts. Poecilia reticulata fish were introduced
   into all wells and streams in the villages, and after one year no
   vectors were found in Puram, and all, or nearly all, A. culicifacies
   were species B in the other two villages. All A. fluviatilis belonged to
   the sibling species T Blood meat analysis indicated that a few of the A.
   culicifacies collected had fed on humans while all the A. fluviatilis
   had fed on bovines. Before the introduction of fish, the annual parasite
   incidence for malaria was high in Puram, but much lower in the other two
   villages. From 1998 (over one year after release of fish) until 2003, no
   malaria cases were detected in the three villages. (C) 2004 Royal

Abstract = {{This study from two districts of Orissa State which are endemic for
   Plasmodium falciparum transmitted by Anopheles fluviatilis and A.
   culicifacies investigated the impact of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane
   (DDT) indoor residual spraying, in view of the ongoing discussion on
   phasing out DDT in India. Based on their high annual parasite incidence
   and logistical considerations, 26 villages in Malkangiri and 28 in
   Koraput district were selected for DDT spraying. For comparison, six and
   four unsprayed villages were chosen from the same districts. In each
   district, the prevalence of malaria infection and incidence of malaria
   fever, indoor resting density and parous rate of the vectors, and their
   susceptibility to DDT were monitored in six and three villages selected
   randomly from the sprayed and unsprayed groups respectively. Anopheles
   fluviatilis was susceptible to DDT while A. culicifacies was resistant.
   DDT residual spraying with 1 g/m(2), was carried out in October-November
   2001. Spraying 74-86\% of human dwellings and 100\% of cattle sheds
   brought down the indoor resting density of A. fluviatilis by 93-95\%.
   This was associated with a significant reduction of incidence of malaria
   fever as well as prevalence of malaria infection from November to
   February in both districts. The spraying also seemed to impact on vector
   longevity, and a residual effect of DDT on the sprayed walls was
   observed up to 10-12 weeks despite re-plastering. Hence DDT spraying can
   still be an effective tool for controlling fluviatilis-transmitted
   malaria. Although this species is exophilic, its nocturnal resting
   behaviour facilitates its contact with the sprayed surfaces. DDT is
   still Useful for residual spraying in India, particularly in areas where
   the vectors are endophilic and not resistant.}},

   eastern Nigeria were examined between July 2002-January 2003 for
   lymphatic filariasis. This is the first time a filariasis Survey due to
   Wuchereria bancrofti has been carried out in this state. Of the 1,243
   pet-sons examined. 210 (16.9\%) had W bancrofti microfilariae. Infection
   varied significantly among communities and ages (p < 0.05) but not
   sex-related (p > 0.05). The Ezza people are predominantly farmers and
   professional hired labourers. There was a close association between
   microfilaria rate and microfilaria-density in various age groups (r =
   0.812; p < 0.01). Microfilaria density is an important measure in the
   epidemiology, treatment and control of human filarisis in this endemic
   foci. Clinical signs and symptoms of the disease include elephantiasis,
   hydrocoele. dermatitis and periodic fever. Clinical symptoms without
   microfilaraemia and microfilaraemia without clinical symptoms were also
   observed. Of 1,603 mosquitoes dissected, Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus
   and Cidex quinquefasciatus showed infectivity rates of 6.3\%, 5.1\% and
   6.0\% respectively. The affected persons and other key informants are
   unaware of the cause of the disease and attributed it to witchcraft,
   violation of taboo, bad water and food. Intervention strategies to be
   integrated into the on-going Community-Directed Treatment with

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: The main rural malaria vector Anopheles
   culicifacies has developed resistance to dichloro diphenyl
   trichloroethane (DDT), hexachloro cyclo hexane (HCH) and malathion in
   the state of Haryana in northern India. An alternative synthetic
   pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin was therefore evaluated on mosquito
   nets against anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, in two villages
   Jagdishpur and Garb Mirakpur of Community Health Center (CHC) Badhkhalsa
   in district Sonipat, Haryana state.
   Methods: Two formulations of bifenthrin, suspension concentrate (SC) and
   micro-emulsion (ME) were compared with micro-capsule suspension (CS) of
   lambdacyhalothrin. The impact of three (loses of bifenthrin (10, 25 and
   50 mg/m(2)) impregnated on mosquito nets was compared with
   lambdacyhalothrin (25 mg/m(2)) and untreated control. Quality assessment
   of treatment on treated nets was carried out by residue analysis and the
   persistence of the insecticide on nets was determined by contact
   bioassays. Efficacy of treated nets on mosquito density was assessed by
   calculating mosquito entry rate, immediate mortality, delayed mortality
   and excito-repellency to the insecticides.
   Results: In susceptibility tests An. culicifacies was susceptible to
   bifenthrin (0.1\% test papers) and to lambdacyhalothrin (0.05\% test
   papers). Bioassays on treated nets against A. culicifacies recorded 100
   per cent mortality up to tenth fortnight for all the doses of
   impregnation with bifenthrin (SC and ME) and lambdacyhalothrin (CS).
   Ring-net bioassays against An. culicifacies showed median knock-down
   time between 3.1 to 11.4 min. Behavioural indices were also studied for
   anopheline and culicine mosquitoes. The reduction in entry rates of
   anopheline and culicine mosquitoes into the rooms with treated nets
   compared to control indicated good efficacy with all the formulations
   and doses of the insecticides.
   Interpretaion \& conclusion: Indoor (immediate) mortality of mosquitoes
   with bifenthrin ME formulation was relatively lower compared to SC
   fomulation of bifenthrin and based on delayed mortility and continued
   susceptibility in bioassays, bifenthrin ME at the rate of 10 mg/m(2)
   dose was found suitable for the impregnation of mosquito nets for phase
   III trial.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports research to predict the distribution of An, minimus.
   a malaria vector in forest fringe areas using GIS to support precision
   surveys for malaria control. Because An. minimus is a forest-associated
   species. generalized thematic maps (1:6000000) of forest cover, soil
   type, altitude, rainfall and temperature were used. Digitization,
   overlaying, integration and analysis of thematic maps were done using
   Arc/Info 8.1 NT and Arc/View 3.2 (GIS, ESRI) software. GIS delineated
   favourable areas for An. minimus where the species is likely to be
   found, and precision surveys can be conducted. Precision field surveys
   in selected locations of favourable/non-favourable areas were carried
   out. The species could be found in all locations designated as a
   favourable area and was absent in nonfavourable areas. In two districts,
   one where the species is reported to have disappeared in the early 1950s
   and the other where it was not reported in earlier surveys, GIS helped
   in precision surveys, and An. minimus was found. The technique can
   quickly cover vast and inaccessible areas and is easy to duplicate in
   other parts of the world to assist cost-effective control of malaria. It
   can also delineate areas favourable for any species of flora and fauna
   to help precision surveys.}},

   vector, and the impact of bendiocarb use on malaria incidence in
   selected villages of the Ghaziabad District, Uttar Pradesh, India. The
   control village was sprayed with malathion at 1 g/m(2) in 2001. Two

   densities of adult An. culicifacies and other mosquito species in
   villages when compared to that of the control village (P < 0.05).
   Bioassay tests revealed that persistence of insecticide against An.

Abstract = {{Follow-up studies were carried out from 1989 to 1998 after withdrawal of

   population of Anopheles culicifacies resistant to
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in
   selected villages in Uttar Pradesh State, India. The study revealed
   82.4-96.5\% reduction in adult density of An. culicifacies and 72.7-96\%
   reduction in malaria incidence in the area sprayed with deltamethrin at
   20 mg/m(2) as compared to a control area sprayed with HCH, for 5
   successive years even after withdrawal of deltamethrin spray. The impact
   was very clear when the annual falciparum incidence was compared with
   that of the control area. The vector population gradually started
   recovering after 5 years. However, the slide falciparum rate remained
   below 4 even after 10 years of withdrawal of spraying. The study
   revealed that indoor residual spraying of deltamethrin would be
   cost-effective, at least in areas where malaria is transmitted by An.
   culicifacies, which is primarily a zoophilic species and associated with
   malaria epidemics. In view of this, a review of the insecticide policy

Abstract = {{0Fever surveys were conducted in several districts of the Indian state
   of Assam to ascertain the prevalence of malaria in relation to vector
   abundance, entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs), and geographic location
   of human settlements. Anopheles minimus were incriminated, but their
   relative abundance and biting rates varied among districts, and no
   significant correlation was observed between these two indicators (r =
   0.43, P = 0.34). Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite
   species except in two districts where P. vivax was the majority
   parasite. The EIRs per person/night were 0.46-0.71 in P.
   falciparum-predominant areas and 0.12 in the district where P. vivax
   predominated. The correlation of percentage of fever cases positive for
   malaria infection in each district with the corresponding EIR was not
   significant (r = 0.6, P = 0.21). Malaria cases were detected in all
   months of the year but peaked during May-June, which corresponded to the
   months of heavy rainfall. These were also the months with highest
   incidence of infection with P. falciparum. Malaria cases were observed
   in all age groups of both sexes, and there was clustering of cases in
   villages near the vector-breeding habitat (perennial seepage streams),
   and foothill villages. However, malaria incidences were consistently
   lower in villages within 5 km of the nearest health care facility, which
   were in town areas. The data presented are indicative of low-to-moderate
   levels of malaria transmission by An. minimus, and would be of value for
   developing future intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the epidemiology of malaria in San Dulakudar, a village in
   Sundargarh District in the state of Orissa in eastern India. Malaria
   transmission is perennial with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting for
   greater than 80\% of malaria cases. Transmission intensity varies with
   season with high transmission after the monsoon rains in autumn and
   winter, low transmission in summer, and intermediate transmission in
   spring. The anthropophagic mosquito Anopheles fluviatilis was identified
   as the main vector for malaria transmission. Based on observations of
   spleen rates and supported by data on malaria parasite prevalence and
   malaria incidence, San Dulakudar can be classified as a hyperendemic
   area for P. falciparum malaria. Parasite prevalence and malaria
   incidence rates decrease with age suggesting that residents of San
   Dulakudar develop immunity to malaria. The study demonstrates the
   presence of regions in the Indian subcontinent such as Sundargarh
   District where P. falciparum is the primary cause of malaria and where
   malaria transmission rates are comparable to those found in many parts
   of Africa.}},

   polymorphs of P. vivax. Sixty-five pools of head-thorax homogenates,
   representing 10 different species of Anopheles, were found reactive,
   giving an overall minimum prevalence of infection (MPI) of 1.58\%, with
   a 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 1.21\%-2.0\%. Among the CSP-reactive
   pools of mosquitoes, 31\% were positive only for P. falciparum, 45\%
   only for P. vivax VK 247, 6\% only for P. vivax VK 210, and 18\% for
   both P. falciparum and P. vivax VK 247. The results indicate that not
   only the proven vector, An. minimus s.I. (MPI=0.71\%), but also several
   species of Anopheles previously considered unimportant in the
   epidemiology of malaria, especially An. aconitus (MPI = 3.95\%), An.
   annularis (MPI = 5.8\%), the An. hyrcanus group (MPI = 0.48\%), An.
   kochi (MPI = 1.28\%), the An. philippinensis-nivipes complex (MPI =
   0.94\%), and An. vagus (MPI = 3.87\%), are important vectors in the
   foothills of Assam.}},

Abstract = {{The changing epidemiology of malaria since 1975 was studied in a tribal
   forested belt of central India, Chhattisgarh state, which is the second
   most highly malarious state in India. Chhattisgarh, which accounts for
   2\% of the total population of the country, contributed >16\% of the
   total malaria cases, 23\% of Plasmodium falciparum, and 7\% of deaths
   due to malaria in the country. Retrospective analysis further revealed
   that, in 1975-76, P. vivax was the predominant species (58\%); however,
   since 1979, P. falciparum showed a steady upward trend (50\%), and in
   2002. P. vivax reduced to 28\%. Between 1986 and 2000, P. falciparum
   cases reported by the National Anti Malaria Programme have increased
   500\%, and the number of deaths also showed a similar alarming increase.
   From 2000 to 2002, though the number of malaria infections and number of
   deaths declined sharply as a result of intensive intervention measures
   (30\% and 95\%, respectively), which included new drugs like Sulfadoxine
   Pyrimethamine and Arteether under Enhanced Malaria Control Programme,
   the proportion of P. falciparum has held steady without any decline.
   Moreover, along with Anopheles fluviatilis, the traditional vector in
   the forest, An. culicifacies has also established itself in the forest.
   The comeback of malaria and establishment of new vectors was largely due
   to the deterioration of health services along with emergence of
   resistance in P. falciparum to Chloroquine and in An. culicifacies to
   DDT. Therefore, a more diversified malaria control program might be
   needed for sustainable malaria control.}},

Abstract = {{The Pakistani Punjab experienced several devastating malaria epidemics
   during the twentieth century. Since the 1980s, however, malaria has been
   at a tow ebb, white in other areas of Pakistan and neighbouring India
   malaria is on the increase. This raises the question of whether
   transmission in the Pakistani Punjab may have been influenced by a
   change in vector species abundance or composition, possibly induced by
   environmental changes. To investigate this question, routinely-collected
   government entomological data for the period 1970 to 1999 for the
   district of Bahawalnagar, in the Indus Basin irrigation system in the
   southern Punjab, was analysed. Our findings suggest that Anopheles
   stephensi has increased in prevalence and became more common than A.
   culicifacies during the 1980s. This shift in species dominance may be
   due to the large-scale ecological changes that have taken place in the
   Punjab, where irrigation-induced waterlogging of soil with related
   salinization has created an environment favourable for the more
   salt-tolerant A. stephensi. Some biotypes of A. stephensi are suspected
   of being less efficient vectors and, therefore, the shift in species
   dominance might have played a role in the reduced transmission in the
   Punjab, although further research is needed to investigate the effect of
   other transmission-influencing factors. (C) 2004 Royal Society of

Abstract = {{Background: Malaria was eradicated in Bahrain about 20 years ago.
   However, because of a large immigrant population, cases of imported
   malaria continued to be seen. This paper presents an evaluation of the
   data from 1992 to 2001 to assess the levels of indigenous and imported
   malaria cases and the potential for reemergence of malaria transmission
   in the country.
   Methods: Epidemiologic and parasitologic data on confirmed malaria cases
   during the review period were analyzed. Data on vector breeding activity
   were also analyzed to determine the potential for reemergence of local
   transmission.
   Results: From 1992 to 2001, 1,572 cases of malaria were reported. All
   were imported malaria cases. There was a consistent decline in the
   number of cases, from 282 (the peak level) in 1992 to 54 in 2001.
   Eighty-four percent (1,318/1,572) of infections were contracted as a
   result of travel to or previous domicile in five countries, namely
   India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Sudan. Plasmodium vivax was
   the etiologic agent in 85.6\% (1,346/1,572) of cases, with Plasmodium
   falciparum accounting for 14\% (220/1,572). During this period, the
   percentage of examined breeding sites where Anopheles mosquito larvae
   were identified remained fairly constant, ranging between 0.05\% and
   0.1\%.
   Conclusions: From 1992 to 2001, there was a consistent decline in the
   number of imported malaria cases in Bahrain. There were no cases of
   locally acquired malaria during this period. The low level of vector
   breeding spots with Anopheles mosquito larvae suggests that the
   potential for reemergence of local transmission remains low.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES Since 1986, we have been studying the changing epidemiology
   of malaria in a forest belt of Mandla, which has the highest number of
   malaria cases in central India (Madhya Pradesh) to define the
   epidemiological characteristics of the infection with each Plasmodium
   species in different seasons of the year. Our long-term objective was to
   determine the dynamics of Plasmodium vivaxvs.P. falciparum infections.
   METHODS Five villages underwent fortnightly surveillance of fever cases.
   Drugs were distributed within 24 h after results of blood smears became
   available as per Indian National Anti-Malaria Programme. Indoor resting
   mosquitoes were also collected fortnightly.
   RESULTS The only two Plasmodium species encountered were P. vivax and P.
   falciparum in both children and adults. Relatively more malaria
   infections were recorded in children (less than or equal to14 years)
   than adults (>14 years) (chi(2) = 89.94, P < 0.00001). However, there
   were significant falling trends in P. vivax from 1986 to 2000 in both
   age groups (less than or equal to14 years from 63 to 13, P < 0.0001 and
   >14 years from 84 to 7, P < 0.0001). The indoor resting density of
   Anopheles culicifacies, an efficient vector resistant to both
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (4\%) and hexachlorocyclohexane
   (HCH) (0.4\%), was very high throughout this period in all villages
   (52.35 +/- 31.8, range 5-200 per man hour). Anopheles fluviatilis was
   present in small numbers 0.78 +/- 1.24 (range 0-7 per man hour).
   CONCLUSION Major contributors of the changing epidemiology of malaria in
   this area are changing drug sensitivity along with insecticide
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of modified CDC miniature light-traps for sampling adult
   mosquitoes was evaluated in comparison with indoor resting, outdoor
   resting, indoor man-landing and outdoor man-landing collections in the
   hilly district of Koraput, Orissa, India. Overall, light-traps captured
   78\% of adult mosquitoes collected by all methods. Of the 16 anopheline
   species recorded in the study area, light-traps effectively sampled 13,
   contributing about 72\% of the total anophelines collected by all
   methods. Light-traps also caught a large number of female Culex vishnui
   Theobald (96\%). As fully-fed mosquitoes were predominant (82\%) and
   caught alive, light-traps can be used to catch large numbers of vector
   mosquitoes for studies on vector prevalence, distribution, vector
   incrimination and also for laboratory bioassays. Light-trap and indoor
   resting collections revealed similar seasonal trends in numbers of
   Anopheles culicifacies Giles, A. fluviatilis James, A. jeyporiensis
   James, A. vagus Doenitz, and A. splendidus Koidzumi. Age-structure of
   the samples did not vary significantly between the two methods.
   Light-traps could be used as an alternative to daytime indoor resting
   collections to monitor the seasonal fluctuations in the abundance and
   parity rates of these species. The light-trap collections correlated
   with indoor and outdoor man-landing collections of A. jeyporiensis and
   the outdoor man-landing collections of A. maculatus Theobald in
   measuring seasonal trends. Light-trap collections can thus be used as a
   substitute for man-landing collections of A. jeyporiensis and A.
   maculatus.}},

Title = {{A review of the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum-dominated malaria in
   irrigated areas of the Thar Desert, India}},
Journal = {{ACTA TROPICA}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-239}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a resurgence of malaria in several parts of
   India, and the Thar Desert in north-western India, is currently
   suffering from the impact of repeated annual epidemics. Nearly all
   malaria epidemics in the Thar Desert have come about with the
   progression of canal-irrigation work, particularly the massive Indira
   Gandhi Nahar Pariyojana (IGNP). Therefore, the Thar Desert provides an
   excellent model for understanding the underlying factors responsible for
   the exacerbation of malaria, pathways of evolution of the epidemics,
   succession in anopheline fauna, changes in the vector breeding and
   feeding preferences and, most importantly, the possible repercussions of
   mismanagement of irrigation systems. Before the initiation of canalised
   irrigation only Anopheles stephensi, breeding exclusively in household
   and community-based underground water reservoirs, and transmitting
   malaria at a low level, was prevalent in the interior of the Thar
   Desert. Since the 1980s, extensive irrigation with water from three
   different canal systems has altered the desert physiography, vector
   preponderance, distribution and vectorial capacity, whilst triggering
   the emergence of Plasmodium falciparum-dominated malaria in the virgin
   levees of the Thar Desert. The major objective of bringing the Himalayan
   waters to the xeric environment of the Thar was to transform it into
   verdure through growing irrigation-intensive crops like paddy,
   groundnut, cotton, mustard, wheat and sugarcane, besides providing
   drinking water to the desert dwellers. The change in crop pattern,
   retention of high surface moisture, and excessive canalisation rife with
   mismanagement of irrigation water have attracted several anophelines,
   including Anopheles culicifacies, which were earlier unknown in the
   desert. Thus, A. culicifiacies has penetrated into the interior of the
   Thar Desert, along with irrigation and is now established in vast areas
   covered by the IGNP project. The distribution of P falciparum-dominated
   malaria in the Thar Desert is more or less synchronous with the spread
   of IGNP-related irrigated agriculture and of A. culicifacies. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) was at one time highly efficient
   in malaria control. However, it has lost its effectiveness in vector
   control and collateral benefits of killing nuisance insects. Malaria
   control in rural India is based on the indoor residual spraying of
   insecticides. The principal insecticide used in malaria control is DDT.
   It has been banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
   Pollutants under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
   auspices in May 2001. The position of the World Health Organization
   (WHO) for DDT is the mirror image of UNEP. The Stockholm Convention
   makes provision for the use of DDT in genuine cases. India has sought
   exemption for the use of DDT in vector control. This article examines
   the role of DDT in malaria vector control and argues that DDT-spraying
   produces diminishing returns and eventually becomes counterproductive.
   Instead, the National Anti-Malaria Programme will do well by abiding
   with the UNEP/WHO. call, reducing reliance on DDT and changing over to
   the bioenvironmental methods, and investing resources in research and
   development in the foreseeable future.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of use of bed-nets treated with alphacypermethrin, at 20 mg
   (ai)/m(2), in comparison to untreated nets or no nets on malaria vectors
   and malaria incidence was studied in tribal villages of Malkangiri
   district, Orissa state, India, which are highly endemic for falciparum
   malaria. Treated or untreated nets were supplied to the villagers in
   June 1999 and the nets were re-treated in September 1999, just before
   the rise in vector abundance and malaria incidence. The seasonal pattern
   of indoor resting Anopheles fluviatilis females was similar in all the
   three groups of villages before the start of intervention and the indoor
   resting catches were not significantly different between
   treatment-groups (two-way ANOVA, F = 1.53; d.f. = (2, 78); P = 0.2).
   During intervention, the indoor resting catches differed significantly
   among treatment groups (two-way ANOVA, F = 38.9; d.f. = (2, 66); P <
   0.005). There was a 99\% reduction in the indoor resting catches of An.
   fluviatilis in villages with treated nets and 61\% reduction in villages
   with untreated nets compared with no-net villages. Comparison between
   villages with and without treated nets showed that there was 97\%
   reduction in indoor resting catches in villages with treated nets.
   Pair-wise comparison showed that the reductions between villages with
   and without nets as well as between villages with treated and untreated
   nets were significant (Dunnett's C-test, P < 0.05). The indoor resting
   catches of Anopheles culicifacies did not differ significantly among the
   three groups of villages either before (F = 0.99; d.f. = (2, 12 1); P =
   0.4) or during intervention (F = 0.21; d.f. = (2, 66); P = 0.8).
   Bioassay with 3 min exposure to treated bed nets showed 100\% mortality
   of An. culicifacies for 2 months and with An. fluviatilis for 4.5 months
   after which tests were not carried out. In villages with treated nets,
   the Annual Parasite Incidence (API) significantly declined (P < 0.05) by
   about 65.7\% and prevalence of infection among children (< 15 years)
   declined by 57.1\%, whereas in villages with untreated nets, there was
   only 34\% reduction in API and 13\% in the prevalence of infection. In
   villages with treated nets, there was 48\% reduction in API and 64\% in
   prevalence of infection compared with villages with untreated nets. The
   impact of use of treated bed nets on other arthropod pests lasted for at
   least 1.5 months. After 1.5 months, observations on arthropod pests were
   not continued. The use rate of treated nets varied from 49.8 to 93.7\%
   in three seasons and about 68.3\% of treated bed nets and 60\% of
   untreated nets were in good condition 1 year after distribution. Out of
   489 users of treated net, five people complained of a burning sensation
   on the face (skin irritation) for 5 days following the distribution of
   treated nets. There were no other complaints of any discomfort in using
   the treated nets. The use of alphacypermethrin treated bed nets at 20 mg
   (ai)/m(2) can be one of the options for reducing the vector abundance
   and incidence of malaria in this area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of the Anopheles (Cellia) Myzomyia
   Series are important malaria vectors in Africa, India and Southeast
   Asia. Among 10 named species of Myzomyia known from the Oriental Region,
   seven form the An. minimus group. Even for expert taxonomists, the
   adults of these species remain difficult to identify morphologically.
   For technical staff of malaria control programmes, confusion may extend
   to misidentification of species that are not formally within the minimus
   group. For identification of specimens from Indochina (Cambodia, Laos,
   Vietnam), we describe a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay,
   based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences, that
   employs a cocktail of primers to identify An. minimus Theobald sibling
   species A and C (sensu; Green et al., 1990) and three other species in
   the An. minimus group (An. aconitus Donitz, An. pampanai Buttiker \&
   Beales, An. varuna Iyengar), as well as An. jeyporiensis James, also
   belonging to the Myzomyia Series. As the test is DNA-based, it can be
   applied to all life stages of these mosquitoes for ecological
   investigations and vector incrimination studies. This PCR assay is
   simpler, quicker, cheaper and more readily interpreted than previous
   assays.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitologic and entomologic cross-sectional surveys were carried out
   during an outbreak of malaria between December 1998 and August 2000 in
   forest villages near the Mohkhed Primary Health Center in the Chhindwara
   District of Madhya Pradesh in central India. In December 1998, surveys
   showed that more than 70\% of the fever cases had malaria, with 87\% of
   the malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The rate of enlarged
   spleens in children was 74.5\%. In November 1999, 58\% of the
   inhabitants were infected with malaria, with 80\% of these cases caused
   by P. falciparum., Chloroquine resistance was seen in 23\% of the cases.
   Anopheles culicifacies was the dominant mosquito species in all surveys
   (70-85\%) and was resistant to DDT. The results indicate that the
   incidence of malaria in Chhindwara has increased gradually from 0.31 per
   1,000 in 1990 to 6.75 per 1,000 in 2000. Improved access to treatment
   facilities, combination therapy, and vector control using an effective
   insecticide appear to be the most promising methods for controlling
   malaria in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Assam, in north-east India, is extremely rich in hydrocarbon
   deposits and the oil industry is the major contributor to its economy. A
   large number of oil fields and related installations in Assam are
   located in forest areas or on their fringes where malaria is a serious
   problem among field staff and security personnel, adversely affecting
   oil production. We carried out an operational research study for one
   year in a forest-based industrial security camp of Dibrugarh district
   and developed an effective malaria control strategy for such areas.
   Methods. The specific strategy was formulated and implemented after
   taking into account the local epidemiology of malaria, vector's ecology
   and malaria risk behaviour of the camp inmates. The strategy was based
   on reducing the man-vector contact, using deltamethrin-treated mosquito
   nets in conjunction with mosquito repellent cream and weekly
   chemoprophylaxis with 300 mg chloroquine. The impact of the strategy was
   monitored entomologically and epidemiologically for one year after
   implementation.
   Results. The mean landing rate of Anopheles dirus, the vector mosquito
   in the camp area, was 5.03 per person per night during the monitoring.
   In spite of such a high density of the vector, the man-vector contact
   was effectively checked by the intervention measures adopted. As a
   result, the incidence of malaria in the camp was reduced by >90\% as
   compared to previous years and the number of malaria cases came down
   from 6.7 per 1000 man-nights in 1998-99 to 0.06 in 2000-01. Mortality
   due to malaria was completely eliminated.
   Conclusion. Control of malaria should be based on the local determinants
   of transmission. The use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in
   conjunction with a mosquito repellent cream is a good intervention for
   controlling Anopheles dirus-transmitted malaria in the forests of
   north-east India. The control module developed on the principle of
   reducing man-mosquito contact is. easy to implement, cost-effective and
   replicable in similar forest-based locations.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is an
   important cause of viral encephalitis in Gorakhpur district, UP. The
   area has been experiencing outbreaks of JE since 1978. No in-depth
   longitudinal studies have been carried out on the mosquito species,
   particularly JE vectors prevailing in the area. Entomological studies
   were carried out in the district in order to determine the species
   composition, relative abundance and seasonal prevalence of mosquitoes in
   relation to the incidence of JE.
   Methods: Three JE affected villages were selected as study sites. Weekly
   visits were made to each village and mosquito collections were made in
   and around the pig enclosures and cattle sheds with the help of mouth
   aspirators, aided by flash lights at dusk.
   Results: The overall mosquito population showed a bimodal pattern with
   short and tall peaks during March and September respectively. Based on
   the elevated density and infection with JE virus, Culex
   tritaeniorhynchus has been considered responsible for causing epidemics
   in the area. Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. whitmorei, Cv. gelidus, Cv.
   epidesmus, Anopheles subpictus, An. peditaeniatus and Mansonia uniformis
   are suspected to have played some role-in the epidemiology of JE in the
   region. JE cases were reported between August and November with the peak
   in October when the vectors population, particularly Cx.
   trilaeniorhynchus was on the decline.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The results of the study indicate that Cx.
   trilaeniorhynchus, the most likely vector of JE together with other
   known vector species remained more active during the period of paddy
   cultivation. Integrated antilarval measures before the beginning of
   paddy irrigation may check the breeding of JE vectors in the paddy
   fields. It may prove beneficial in reducing the vector population during
   the JE transmission season.}},

Year = {{2003}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Anopheles stephensi and A. culicifacies are
   the two major vectors of malaria in Karnataka. These mosquito
   populations are continuously being exposed directly or indirectly to
   different insecticides including the most effective pyrethroids.
   Therefore, there is a threat of insecticide resistance development. We
   subjected these vectors to larval bioassay using two popular pyrethroids
   viz deltamethrin and permethrin. An attempt was also made to correlate
   the activities of certain detoxifying enzymes such as A- esterase,
   B-esterase, glutathione-S transferase (GST) and glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (G6PD) with the tolerance levels of the two vectors.
   Methods: Larval bioassay was carried out following the standard WHO
   procedure on field-collected larvae. The LC50 and LC90 values were
   calculated following Probit analysis. Biochemical estimations were done
   with a U V spectrophotometer and the isozyme studies employing native
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
   Results: The results of the larval bioassay revealed that A. stephensi
   has more tolerance to deltamethrin than A. culicifacies and vice versa
   for permethrin. Biochemical estimations revealed significantly (P<0.05)
   higher levels of A-esterase and GST activity in A. stephensi whereas A.
   culicifacies showed significantly higher (P<0.05) levels of B-esterase
   and G6PD activity. The total larval protein assayed was found to he more
   (P<0.05) in A. stephensi. The isozyme profiles also revealed difference
   in mobility, intensity and the number of hands.
   Interpreation \& conclusion: As these malaria vectors are exposed to
   different kinds of insecticides, they develop increased enzyme
   activities to overcome the insecticide pressure. This has enhanced the
   tolerance level against the pyrethroids tested. Thus, A. stephensi was
   found to be tolerant to deltamethrin depicting a higher activity of
   A-esterase and GST enzymes, whereas the higher activity of B-esterase
   and G6PD has resulted in the development of tolerance to permethrin in
   A. culicifacies.}},

Abstract = {{In an area of India where the main rural malaria vector, Anopheles
   culicifacies Giles, has developed triple resistance to DDT, HCH, and
   malathion sprayed indoors in antimalaria program, bifenthrin (10\%
   wettable powder) was evaluated in a randomized house-scale trial between
   July 1999 and March 2000. Entomological impact of four serial doses of
   bifenthrin (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/m(2)) sprayed in rooms in five
   villages was compared with malathion (2 g/m(2)) and unsprayed control.
   All. culicifacies was 100\% susceptible to bifenthrin (0.1\%). but only
   57\% to malathion (5\%) test papers. Contact bioassavs were carried out
   on sprayed surfaces for 24 wk, and 24 h mortality in An. culicifacies
   was recorded. Bifenthrin 100- and 200-mg doses caused greater than or

Abstract = {{Some recent outbreaks of Plasmodium falciparum malaria have been
   attributed, at least in part, to increases in the intensity and duration
   of rainfall caused by the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO), a
   periodic climatic phenomenon. Since it takes time for unusually heavy
   rainfall to translate into unusually high densities of the vector
   mosquitoes, it has been suggested that data on recent rainfall might be
   used to predict climate-related epidemics of malaria. This possibility
   was explored by comparing the patterns in the incidence of malaria in
   (1) Dungaria, a highly malarious village in the central-Indian district
   of Mandla, and (2) Mandla district as a whole, for the periods 1986-2000
   and 1967-2000, respectively, with data on rainfall for the same areas
   and periods. Unfortunately, no clear relationship was observed between
   rainfall and malaria incidence, although a major development project to
   improve water resources in the study area (which resulted in local
   villages being partially or completely submerged in water) may have
   masked any significant association. A useful method for predicting which
   years are going to be high- or low-risk years for malaria epidemics, in
   the present and other epidemiological settings, remains a future goal.}},

Abstract = {{Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato, the major vector of malaria in the
   plain areas of rural India, has become resistant to commonly used
   insecticides, viz. DDT, HCH and malathion in most parts of the country.
   To control resistant An. culicifacies, synthetic pyrethroids have been
   sprayed during the past one decade in some areas, but so far resistance
   to pyrethroids has not been reported in this species. This paper reports
   the reduced susceptibility of An. culicifacies from Rameshwaram Island,
   Ramnathapuram district, Tamil Nadu, to deltamethrin, a synthetic
   pyrethroid. Knock-down bioassays revealed more than two-fold higher
   values of KT50 and KT90 (time for knock-down of 50\% and 90\% exposed
   mosquitoes) in An. culicifacies from Rameshwaram Island, than
   populations from other areas. Laboratory selection of the adult
   mosquitoes of Rameshwaram (Rmr) strain against deltamethrin for 12
   generations resulted in the development of 31- and 15-fold higher
   resistance at LT50 and LT90 levels, respectively. The selected
   deltamethrin-resistant strain also showed cross-resistance to other
   synthetic pyrethroids, viz. lambdacyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, permethrin

Abstract = {{A major debate in infectious disease epidemiology concerns the relative
   importance of exposure and host factors, such as sex and acquired
   immunity, in determining observed age patterns of parasitic infection in
   endemic communities. Nonhomogeneous contact between hosts and vectors is
   also expected to increase the reproductive rate, and hence transmission,
   of mosquito-borne infections. Resolution of these questions for human
   parasitic diseases has been frustrated by the lack of a quantitative
   tool for quantifying the exposure rate of people in communities. Here,
   we show that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for
   amplifying and fingerprinting human DNA from mosquito bloodmeals can
   address this problem for mosquito-borne diseases. Analysis of parallel
   human and mosquito (resting Culex quinquefasciatus) samples from the
   same households in an urban endemic focus for bancroftian filariasis in
   South India demonstrates that a 9-locus radioactive short-tandem repeat
   system is able to identify the source of human DNA within the bloodmeals
   of nearly 80\% of mosquitoes. The results show that a person's exposure
   rate, and hence the age and sex patterns of exposure to bites in an
   endemic community, can be successfully quantified by this method. Out of
   276 bloodmeal PCR fingerprints, we also found that on average, 27\% of
   the mosquitoes caught resting within individual households had fed on
   people outside the household. Additionally, 13\% of mosquitoes biting
   within households contained blood from at least 2 people, with the rate
   of multiple feeding depending on the density of humans in the household.
   These complex vector feeding behaviors may partly account for the
   discrepancies in estimates of the infection rates of mosquito-borne
   diseases calculated parasitologically and entomologically, and they
   underline the potential of this tool for investigating the transmission
   dynamics of infection.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the cross-resistance to three highly toxic Bacillus
   sphaericus strains, IAB-59 (serotype H6), IAB-881 (serotype H3), and
   IAB-872 (serotype H48), of four colonies of the Culex pipiens complex
   resistant to B. sphaericus 2362 and 1593, both of which are serotype
   H5a5b strains. Two field-selected highly resistant colonies originating
   from India (KOCHI, 17,000-fold resistance) and France (SPRAE,
   23,000-fold resistance) and a highly resistant laboratory-selected
   colony from California (GeoR, 36,000-fold resistance) showed strong
   cross-resistance to strains IAB-881 and IAB-872 but significantly weaker
   cross-resistance to IAB-59 (3- to 43-fold resistance). In contrast, a
   laboratory-selected California colony with low-level resistance (JRMM-R,
   5-fold resistance.) displayed similar levels of resistance (5- to
   10-fold) to all of the B. sphaericus strains tested. Thus, among the
   mosquitocidal strains of B. sphaericus we identified a strain, IAB-59,
   which was toxic to several Culex colonies that were highly resistant to
   commercial strains 2362 and 1593. Our analysis also indicated that
   strain IAB-59 may possess other larvicidal factors. These results could
   have important implications for the development of resistance management
   strategies for area-wide mosquito control programs based on the use of
   B. sphaericus preparations.}},

Abstract = {{In a malaria endemic area in Orissa state in eastern India baseline
   (November 1989 to October 1990) malaria incidence ranged from 215 to 328
   cases/1,000 population/yr in different groups of villages. In November
   1990, nylon bednets treated with deltamethrin at 25 mg/m(2) were given
   out in two villages (population 1062), untreated bednets were given out
   in five villages (population 1,226) and in one village (population 786)
   nets were not given. Nets were retreated in October 1991 and June 1992
   in treated-net villages. The trial continued until October 1992. The
   treated nets caused significant reduction in indoor resting density,
   biting (landing), light trap catches, human engorgement rate, and parous
   rate of malaria vector Anopheles culicifacies Giles as compared with
   untreated nets or no nets. Untreated nets also caused reductions in
   biting and indoor density. Treated nets retained insecticidal action
   well over 6 mo. In the final year, malaria incidence was reduced 8.9\%
   in the no-net village, 34.9\% in the villages with untreated nets, and
   59.1\% in villages with treated nets. The relative risk of malaria and
   parasite rates declined significantly in villages with treated nets.
   Pediatric splenomegaly rate did not change in the no-net village,
   increased significantly in villages with untreated nets, but decreased
   significantly in those with treated nets. Treated nets also reduced
   pediatric anemia rates, but Hb concentration increased in all villages.
   Considering the benefits of treated bednets and development of
   resistance among vectors to DDT and malathion, bednets treated with
   deltamethrin could be an effective alternative strategy to control
   malaria in forested areas in India.}},

Abstract = {{As part of investigations on potential linkages between irrigation and
   malaria transmission, all surface water bodies in and around three
   villages along an irrigation distributary in South Punjab, Pakistan,
   were surveyed for anopheline mosquito larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) from
   April 1999 to March 2000. Samples were characterized according to
   exposure to sunlight, substratum, presence of vegetation, fauna,
   inorganic matter and physical water condition (clear/turbid/foul). Also
   water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), electroconductivity (EC) and
   pH of sites were recorded. A total of 37 982 Anopheles larvae of six
   morphological types were collected from 2992 samples taken from
   irrigation/agricultural and village/domestic aquatic habitats. Anopheles
   subpictus Grassi sensu lato was by far the most abundant (74.3\%),
   followed by An. culicifacies Giles s.l. (4.1\%), An. stephensi Liston
   s.l. (2.6\%), An. pulcherrimus Theobald (1.8\%), An. peditaeniatus
   Leicester (0.3\%) and An. nigerrimus Giles (0.1\%). The four most
   abundant species were significantly associated with waterlogged fields
   and communal village drinking-water tanks. Habitat characteristics most
   correlated with occurrence of anophelines were the physical water
   condition and the absence/presence of fauna, particularly predators.
   Occurrence and abundance of Anopheles immatures were not significantly
   correlated with water temperature, DO, EC or pH, Malaria vectors of the
   Anopheles culicifacies complex occurred at relatively low densities,
   mainly in irrigated and waterlogged fields. In South Punjab, where
   rainfall is very low, it should be possible to reduce anopheline
   breeding through water management, as larvae develop mainly in water
   bodies that are directly or indirectly related to the extensive
   canal-irrigation system.}},
